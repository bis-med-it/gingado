Romania,2012-01-05,"In its meeting of January 5, 2012, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR will further monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by accordingly adjusting its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term, as well as financial stability. The analysis of recent developments in macroeconomic indicators confirms a consolidation of disinflation, with the annual inflation rate falling to 3.44 percent in November 2011 amid favourable trends in volatile prices, the fading-out of the first-round effect of the VAT rate hike and the ongoing prudent monetary policy stance. The annual adjusted CORE21 inflation rate also fell, reaching 2.64 percent in November against 4.77 percent in March  the peak for 2011. Recent central bank assessments show that in December 2011 the annual inflation rate will near the mid-point of the variation band around the 3 percent target, in line with the latest NBR forecast. They also reconfirm the prospects of a slowdown in both headline and core inflation rates, along with the downward adjustment in inflation expectations, in the coming months. The recovery of the Romanian economy has continued  underpinned by favourable dynamics of exports, as well as of industrial and farming output  whereas the growing uncertainties regarding global and European growth amid a worsened global risk appetite and heightened sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone are hindering the short-term outlook for the overall economic activity in Romania. At the same time, despite a mild advance in the past few months, the annual growth of credit to the private sector, mainly of leu-denominated loans, has remained relatively modest, also against the background of increased perception of risks related to the developments in the European banking sector. As uncertainties regarding the external environment, capital flows, the trends in administered and some volatile prices persist, the prudent monetary policy stance will enhance the favourable prospects of the convergence of inflation towards the medium-term targets via an effective anchoring of inflation expectations, given that price stability is a precondition for achieving sustainable and lasting economic growth. In this context, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 5.75 percent per annum from 6.00 percent. Thus, starting January 6, 2012, the annual interest rate on the deposit facility will be cut to 1.75 percent from 2.00 percent, while the overnight (Lombard) rate will be 9.75 percent a year versus 10.00 percent previously. The NBR Board has also decided to further pursue an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and keep unchanged the minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. Moreover, the NBR Board reaffirms that the gradual adjustment of monetary conditions will not only help resume robust economic growth, but also boost domestic savings, including the aim to support a sustainable external deficit and a lower dependence on external financing. The NBR will continue to closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by accordingly adjusting its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving price stability, as well as financial stability, and hence lasting economic growth in the context of fulfilment of commitments under the external financing agreements with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for February 2, 2012, when the new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1 Calculated by the NBR by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index."
Poland,2012-01-11,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 11 January 2012 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 10-11 January 2012 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate at 4.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 6.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 3.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 4.75% on an annual basis. The recently released data suggest weakening of growth in the global economy; yet, the situation varies across regions. The United States saw some improvement in business sentiment, and its economic growth might have slightly accelerated in the recent period. In the euro area, on the other hand, economic growth continued to slow down, with forecasts for subsequent quarters being revised downwards. This negatively affects economic outlook for countries being euro area main trading partners. Data on many emerging economies indicate a certain weakening of their economic activity. Inflation in the world remains elevated, which is largely driven by still high commodity prices, including crude oil prices. Weaker global economic activity, fiscal imbalance and deteriorating situation in the banking system observed in some euro area countries are contributing to persistently high risk aversion and heightened volatility of asset prices, including exchange rates. Increased asset price volatility is further fuelled by huge liquidity surplus in the global financial markets related to strongly expansionary monetary policy pursued by major central banks. Despite worsening sentiment of domestic economic agents, favourable data on industrial output, construction and assembly output and retail sales indicate that in 2011 Q4 economic growth in Poland might have declined only slightly and remained at a relatively high level. On the other hand, deteriorating leading business condition indicators suggest that economic activity in the subsequent quarters may slow down, largely as a result of weaker economic growth in countries being Poland's main trading partners. November saw a modest increase in the registered unemployment rate, which was however accompanied by a slightly rise of the employment in the corporate sector. Wage growth in enterprises remained moderate. Lending to corporates continued to rise in November. Similarly, zloty-denominated mortgage loans to households maintained their relatively steep growth, while consumer lending in annual terms went on shrinking. 00-919 Warszawa, ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, phone 22 653 28 88, fax 22 653 13 28 Annual CPI inflation in November increased more than anticipated, i.e. up to 4.8%, remaining markedly above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. The rise in inflation was driven by growing food and fuel prices and higher core inflation. An increase was also noted in PPI inflation and inflation expectations of households and corporates. In the coming months, the annual CPI will continue to run at an elevated level. On the one hand, waning impact of VAT rate increases and considerable rises in food and energy prices observed in the first half of 2011 will be conducive to lowering inflation at the beginning of 2012. On the other hand, persistently high commodity prices in the global markets and the previously observed weakening of the zloty exchange rate will be supporting heightened price growth. In the opinion of the Council, in the medium term inflation will be curbed by gradually decelerating domestic demand amidst fiscal tightening, including reduced public investment spending, and interest rate increases implemented in the first half of 2011, as well as the expected global economic slowdown. The impact of the situation in the global financial markets on zloty exchange rate together with a possible rise in commodity prices continues to be an upside risk to domestic price developments. In the opinion of the Council, the monetary policy tightening implemented in the first half of 2011 supports inflation return to the target in the medium term, however the risk of elevated inflation in the coming months has increased. At the same time the recent domestic economic developments indicate that the expected demand deceleration in the coming quarters may prove weaker than previously anticipated. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council does not rule out the possibility of further monetary policy adjustments in the future, should the outlook for inflation returning to the target deteriorate. In the recent period the National Bank of Poland sold some amount of foreign currencies in exchange for zlotys. Such transactions were consistent with the pursued monetary policy strategy defined in the Monetary Policy Guidelines. The Council stresses that the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2012 do not allow for the possibility of the NBP purchasing Treasury securities as monetary policy instrument. In the context of the current distortions in the international financial markets the Council reiterates that the National Bank of Poland is a lender of last resort to banks."
Chile,2012-01-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 12 January 2012 Monetary Policy Meeting  January 2012* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to reduce the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 5.0% (annual). Internationally, the advanced economies are growing slowly, although some economic indicators in the United States have shown signs of improvement, while emerging market economies continue decelerating. Uncertainty persists about how problems will be resolved in the Eurozone, where fiscal and financial risks are still very high. Global financial conditions are still tight, and the prices of some commodities have risen. Domestically, output and demand have evolved in line with forecasts in the latest Monetary Policy Report. The labor market is still tight. The money market has normalized, while financing conditions for some agents are tighter than a few months ago. December's headline and core inflation was higher than expected due to the prices of perishables and other foods and the lagged incidence of the peso depreciation in the fourth quarter of 2011. Inflation expectations remain near the target. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2012-01-12,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided today to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged, following the 25 basis point decreases on 3 November and 8 December 2011. The information that has become available since early December broadly confirms our previous assessment. Inflation is likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. At the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. As expected, ongoing financial market tensions continue to dampen economic activity in the euro area, while, according to some recent survey indicators, there are tentative signs of a stabilisation in activity at low levels. The economic outlook remains subject to high uncertainty and substantial downside risks. In such an environment, cost, wage and price pressures in the euro area should remain modest and inflation rates should develop in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Overall, it is essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. A very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted. The provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will continue to support euro area banks, and thus the financing of the real economy. The extensive recourse to the first three-year refinancing operation indicates that our non-standard policy measures are providing a substantial contribution to improving the funding situation of banks, thereby supporting financing conditions and confidence. In addition, we are actively working towards the implementation of all the measures announced at our December meeting, which should provide additional support to the economy. As stated on previous occasions, all the non-standard monetary policy measures are temporary in nature. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP in the euro area grew by 0.1% quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2011. At present, a number of factors seem to be dampening the underlying growth momentum in the euro area. They include moderate global demand growth and weak business and consumer confidence in the euro area. Domestic demand is likely to be dampened by the ongoing tensions in euro area sovereign debt markets, as well as the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors. At the same time, we continue to expect euro area economic activity to recover, albeit very gradually, in the course of 2012, supported by developments in global demand, very low short-term interest rates and all the measures taken to support the functioning of the financial sector. In the Governing Council's assessment, substantial downside risks to the economic outlook for the euro area continue to exist in an environment of high uncertainty. They notably relate to a further intensification of the tensions in euro area debt markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to the global economy, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.8% in December 2011, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 3.0% in the preceding three months. This decline was expected and reflects a downward base effect stemming from energy prices. Inflation rates have been at elevated levels since the end of 2010, mainly driven by higher energy and other commodity prices. Looking ahead, they are likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. This pattern reflects the expectation that, in an environment of weaker growth in the euro area and globally, underlying cost, wage and price pressures in the euro area should remain modest. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as broadly balanced. On the upside, the main risks relate to further increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years, and possible increases in commodity prices. The main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area and globally. Turning to the monetary analysis, taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate. The annual growth rate of M3 decreased to 2.0% in November 2011, after 2.6% in October. As in the previous three months, monetary developments in November were affected by the heightened uncertainty in financial markets. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, decreased to 1.9% in November, from 3.0% in October. The annual growth rates of loans to non-financial corporations and loans to households, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, both moderated in November, and stood at 1.8% and 2.3% respectively, with slightly negative monthly flows observed for MFI loans to non-financial corporations. Overall, despite the moderation in loan growth, the figures on lending do not so far suggest that the heightened financial market tensions led to a sizeable curtailment of credit in the euro area as a whole in the period to November. At the same time, given that credit supply effects can manifest themselves with lags, close scrutiny of credit developments is warranted in the period ahead. The soundness of bank balance sheets, supported by the increase in capital positions, will be a key factor in facilitating an appropriate provision of credit to the economy over time. It is essential that the implementation of banks' recapitalisation plans does not result in developments that are detrimental to the financing of economic activity in the euro area. To sum up, incoming information broadly confirms our previous assessment. Inflation is likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. As expected, ongoing financial market tensions continue to dampen economic activity in the euro area, while, according to some recent survey indicators, there are tentative signs of a stabilisation in activity at low levels. The economic outlook remains subject to high uncertainty and substantial downside risks. In such an environment, cost, wage and price pressures in the euro area should remain modest and inflation rates should develop in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture, with the underlying pace of monetary expansion continuing to be moderate. Turning to fiscal policies, euro area governments need to do their utmost to support fiscal sustainability by correcting excessive deficits in accordance with the agreed timetables and by moving to a structural balanced budget or surplus position over the medium term. Slippages in the implementation of fiscal consolidation plans of vulnerable countries must be corrected swiftly by structural fiscal improvements. With regard to the new provisions of the EU economic governance framework that recently came into force, it is crucial that all the elements be implemented rigorously. Only ambitious policies to prevent and correct macroeconomic and fiscal imbalances will foster public confidence in the soundness of policy actions, and thus strengthen overall economic sentiment. The Governing Council welcomes the European Council's agreement to move to a stronger economic union, which was announced on 9 December 2011. The new fiscal compact, comprising a fundamental restatement of the fiscal rules together with the fiscal commitments that euro area governments have made, is an important contribution to ensuring the long-run sustainability of public finances in the euro area countries. The wording of the rules needs to be unambiguous and effective. The further development of the European financial stability tools should make the operation of the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism more effective. Concerning the involvement of the private sector in financial assistance for indebted countries, we welcome the reaffirmation that the decisions taken on 21 July and 26 and 27 October 2011 concerning Greek debt are unique and exceptional. To accompany fiscal consolidation, the Governing Council calls for the urgent implementation of bold and ambitious structural reforms. Going hand in hand, fiscal consolidation and structural reforms would strengthen confidence, growth prospects and job creation. Key reforms should be rapidly carried out to help the euro area countries to improve competitiveness, increase the flexibility of their economies and enhance their longer-term growth potential. Product market reforms should focus on fully opening up markets to increased competition. Labour market reforms should focus on removing rigidities and enhancing wage flexibility."
South Korea,2012-01-13,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers major advanced economies to have remained sluggish, and growth in emerging market economies to have also slowed somewhat. Going forward the Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be very moderate, and judges that the downside risks to growth are becoming larger, due mostly to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and to the possibilities of the slumps in major country economies and the unrest in international financial markets continuing. In Korea, exports have kept up their steady increase, but domestic demand has been subdued with consumption and construction investment decreasing from the previous month. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has sustained its large scale of increase, led by the private sector. The Committee anticipates that domestic economic growth will gradually return to its long-term trend level going forward, after remaining subdued for some time due mostly to the impact of external risk factors. Consumer price inflation continued to exceed 4% in December last year, driven by the prices of petroleum products and processed food, and core inflation also came in at a level similar to that of the previous month. In the coming months, factors including the base effect from the previous year and the easing of demand- side pressures will work in favor of price stability, but the Committee expects the pace of decline in the inflation rate to be moderate given factors such as ongoing high inflation expectations. In the housing market, prices have remained weak in Seoul and its surrounding areas and leasehold deposits there have decreased, due mostly to the impact of low off-season demand. The uptrends of both housing prices and leasehold deposits in the rest of the country have slowed. In the financial markets, stock prices and the exchange rate have continued to fluctuate widely, due chiefly to unease concerning external risk factors and to geopolitical risks. The trend of decline in long-term market interest rates has halted and they have shown fluctuations within a narrow range. Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and economic risk factors both at home and abroad, as well as the evolution of inflation expectations, will conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the midpoint of the inflation target over a medium term horizon amid continuing sound growth of the economy."
Peru,2012-01-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2012 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference at 4.25 percent. This decision takes into account the lower growth being recorded by some components of expenditure, the current international financial risks, and the rise of inflation associated mainly with temporary supply factors. Future adjustments in the reference interest rate will depend on the evolution of inflation and its determinants. Inflation in December continued to be affected by transitory supply factors and recorded a monthly rate of 0.27 percent and an annual rate of 4.74 percent. Core inflation registered a monthly rate of 0.14 percent (the lowest rate of the year) and a rate of 3.65 percent in the last 12 months, lower rate compared with November (3.73 percent). Inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.41 percent in December and accumulated an annual rate of 2.42 percent, lower rate compared with previous months (2.48 percent). Inflation is expected to gradually converge to the target range in 2012 provided that the cost pressures generated by the significant supply factors subside. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show that growth in the economy is moderating and registering lower rates than the ones observed in the first semester of 2011. Thus, even though sales of electricity maintained a strong dynamism in December registering a growth rate of 8.1 percent, this rate is lower than the growth rate of 9.6 percent observed in the first semester. Furthermore, indicators of global economic activity show lower growth rates to 2012 and that uncertainty persists in international financial markets. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments on a prompt and timely basis. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. In 2012, the Board will approve the Monetary Program for each month on the sessions to be held on the following dates: February 9 March 8 April 12 May 10 June 7 July 12 August 9 September 6 October 11 November 8 December 6 In 2012 the BCRP will publish its Inflation Report on the following dates: March 23 June 15 September 14 December 14."
Georgia,2012-01-18,"NBG Lowers Its Policy Rate By 25 Basis Points The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on January 18, 2012 and decided to lower its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) by 25 basis points to 6.5 percent. Annual inflation remained low in December, at 1.9 percent. Core inflation (net of food and energy) is still low as well, amounting to 0.4 percent. According to the existing forecasts, inflation is expected to remain low in the first half of the year. Starting in summer this trend is expected to be changed, although the inflation rate will remain below the target. The trade deficit keeps increasing in the recent period, mostly due to the increase in imports. Since August last year the real exchange rate had been appreciating, the trend that was reversed during last two months. The expected decline in the economic activity of EU countries will have a negative impact on the trade balance of Georgia, which will possibly result in additional weakening of the aggregate demand in the country. Existing forecasts indicate that given the unchanged policy stance, the inflation rate will remain below the target. Hence the Monetary Policy Committee of the NBG considered it appropriate to continue easing the monetary policy and decided to decrease the refinancing rate by 25 basis points. The National Bank of Georgia considers that at present the recent monetary easing will be sufficient to keep the inflation in the medium term at the target level. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on February 15, 2012."
Philippines,2012-01-18,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to reduce the BSP's key policy interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.25 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility, effective immediately. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also reduced accordingly. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation outlook remains comfortably within the target range, with expectations well-anchored. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that average annual inflation rates are likely to fall within the lower half of the 3-5 percent target range up to 2013. Pressures on global commodity prices are seen to continue to abate amid weaker global growth prospects. However, the impact of strong capital inflows on domestic liquidity and the effect of geopolitical tensions in the MENA region on global oil supplies will continue to pose upside risks to inflation. At the same time, the Monetary Board considers the overall balance of global economic activity to be tipping towards a further slowdown. Although the US economy has been showing signs of improvement, it remains vulnerable to financial market volatility amid continued concerns about long-term fiscal sustainability. Meanwhile, the Euro area economy is notably weaker with interlocking sovereign debt and banking problems weighing down on global sentiment. Amidst these developments, the Philippine economy is likely to face external headwinds in 2012. While the Philippine economy continues to expand, sustained domestic spending is expected to compensate for weaker external demand. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board has concluded that the benign inflation outlook allowed some scope for a reduction in policy rates to help boost economic activity and support market confidence. The BSP shall continue to monitor emerging demand and price developments to ensure that monetary policy settings remain supportive of non-inflationary economic growth."
South Africa,2012-01-19,"Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the outlook for domestic inflation and economic growth has deteriorated, posing a serious challenge for monetary policy going forward. Inflation is now expected to remain above the upper end of the target range for a more extended period, but there is still no evidence of significant demand pressures in the economy. While economic growth in the fourth quarter was likely to have exceeded that in the previous two quarters, the forecast for growth in 2012 has been revised downward. The primary reason for the worsening domestic growth outlook is the risk of contagion from the persistent crisis in Europe, which shows no sign of a speedy resolution. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 6,1 per cent in December 2011, unchanged from November. The categories of food, housing and utilities, and transport together accounted for 4,4 percentage points of the December outcome. Food price inflation accelerated further to 11,6 per cent, from 11,1 per cent in November, while petrol prices increased by 26,4 per cent. Administered price inflation excluding petrol was unchanged at 8,7 per cent. CPI inflation excluding food, petrol and electricity remained unchanged at 3,9 per cent, indicating relatively benign core inflation outcomes. Producer price inflation moderated from a year-on-year rate of 10,6 per cent in October 2011 to 10,1 per cent in November. The impact of the depreciated rand exchange rate is evident in the 15,9 per cent increase in the price of imported commodities. Food price inflation remained elevated, with agricultural prices increasing at a year-on-year rate of 12,1 per cent in November, and manufactured food prices increasing by 8,4 per cent. The inflation forecast of the Bank has been subject to a further upward revision. Inflation is now expected to remain outside the upper end of the target range for the whole of 2012, and to peak in the second quarter of 2012 at around 6,6 per cent before declining gradually and returning to within the target range in the first quarter of 2013. Inflation is expected to measure 5,5 per cent in the final quarter of 2013. The Bank's forecast of core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, shows a moderately rising trend, with the peak of around 5,5 per cent expected in the first two quarters of 2013. The main factor contributing to the upward revision of the forecast is the changed assumption relating to the exchange rate of the rand, which was partly offset by the downward adjustment to the global growth assumption. Inflation expectations, as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University in the fourth quarter of 2011, have increased moderately but have remained relatively anchored around the upper end of the inflation target range. Inflation is expected to average 6,1 per cent in 2012, compared with 5,9 per cent expected in the previous survey. Expectations for 2013 increased from 5,9 per cent to 6,0 per cent. All categories of respondents revised their forecasts moderately upwards for both years, except for business executives whose expectations for inflation in 2013 remained unchanged at 6,3 per cent. The global outlook remains clouded by the worsening situation in the Eurozone, and growth forecasts for the region have generally been revised down amid widespread sovereign ratings downgrades. It is now generally accepted that the Eurozone is likely to experience a recession in 2012, but the extent and duration is still uncertain. The increasingly fragile sentiment is exacerbated by the lack of resolution of the sovereign debt crisis and the consequent increase in sovereign debt yields; further fiscal austerity measures in the region; and the impact on the real economy of higher capital requirements for banks and consequent bank deleveraging. Tightened lending standards have also had cross-border implications for a number of emerging market economies, particularly in Eastern Europe and Latin America. Although the OECD leading indicators and global PMIs are trending downwards, the economic growth outcomes in Japan and the United States have been more favourable than was the case in mid-2011. The unemployment rate in the US has declined, and both consumption and investment expenditure have shown some signs of recovery, although downside risks from fiscal consolidation and the continued weakness in the housing market remain. Growth in emerging market and developing countries, while still relatively favourable, is also expected to moderate somewhat, in part due to contagion effects from the European crisis as well as policies which have been aimed at curbing domestic demand pressures. Economic growth in China is also expected to slow, but a hard landing is not anticipated. Sub-Saharan Africa, which has become an increasingly important destination for South African exports, is expected to continue to grow at a rate in excess of 5 per cent. Global inflation appears to be moderating, as weaker demand has contributed to declines in food and commodity prices. Oil prices, however, have been underpinned by risks to supply due to geopolitical factors. The rand exchange rate has continued to display a relatively high degree of volatility in response to erratic changes in global risk aversion. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the rand has traded in a range of between R7,93 and R8,60 to the US dollar, but for the past month the range has generally been between R8,00 and R8,20. Since the previous meeting, the rand is more or less unchanged against the dollar, and appreciated by about 6 per cent per cent against the euro, reflecting the influence of the euro/dollar exchange rate on the domestic currency. On a trade weighted basis, the rand appreciated by almost 3 per cent over the same period. South Africa's experience with portfolio capital flows during 2011 was similar to the general emerging market experience of slowing bond inflows and net equity outflows. For the year as a whole non-resident purchases of bonds amounted to R42 billion, while net sales of equities to the value of R17 billion were recorded. The outlook for the rand exchange rate remains highly dependent on global risk appetite. While the rand remains vulnerable to global developments, it has been relatively stable in the past few weeks, and consensus forecasts reflect an expectation that the current levels will be sustained for a protracted period. But this is significantly dependent on global sentiment and developments. The outlook for domestic economic growth remains subdued. According to the Bank's forecast, the annual real growth rate in 2011 is estimated to have been in the region of 3,1 per cent, but the outlook for 2012 and 2013 has deteriorated relative to the previous forecast, mainly due to a downward revision to the global growth assumption. Growth in 2012 is expected to average 2,8 per cent compared with 3,2 per cent in the previous forecast, while the forecast for growth in 2013 has been revised down from 4,2 per cent to 3,8 per cent. This implies a further expected widening of the output gap during this period. Despite the less favourable outlook, some improvement is expected in the mining and manufacturing sectors which both contracted in the second and third quarters of 2011. Although mining output contracted further in October, it rebounded on a month-on-month basis in November, but the change in the three months to November compared to the previous three months showed a contraction of 0,7 per cent. The manufacturing sector experienced positive growth in October and November, with the physical volume of manufacturing output increasing at a three-month-on-three-month rate of 2,6 per cent. Nevertheless the sector is expected to remain under pressure. Following four consecutive months of increases, the Kagiso PMI declined to below the neutral 50 level to 49,4 in December. The construction sector also remains subdued, notwithstanding an increase in the real value of building plans passed in November, and a slight increase in FNB Building Confidence Index in the fourth quarter. On the positive side, the sector could benefit from the continued but slow improvement in the growth of gross fixed capital formation which increased at an annualised rate of 5,6 per cent in the third quarter of 2011. According to the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index, business confidence remains relatively low, having declined marginally in the fourth quarter of 2011. Despite the weak economic performance in the third quarter, employment growth surprised on the upside. According to the Quarterly Employment Survey of Statistics South Africa, formal non-agricultural employment increased by 47,300 in the quarter and by 207,000 year on year, with the bulk of the increases in the second and third quarters coming from the private sector. This trend is consistent with that observed in the Quarterly Labour Force Survey. However, the employment losses suffered during the recession have still not been recovered and future employment prospects remain uncertain given the fragile economic outlook. Growth in consumption expenditure by households continues to be the main driver of growth in the economy but growth rates remain moderate and are not expected to pose a risk to inflation. Real final consumption expenditure by households increased at an annualised rate of 3,7 per cent in the third quarter of 2011, up from 3,3 per cent in the previous quarter, but lower than the levels recorded in previous quarters. Real retail sales grew at a year-on-year rate of 6,8 per cent in November, while on a three-month-to-three-month basis growth of 3,1 per cent was recorded. According to the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index, consumer confidence increased marginally in the fourth quarter of 2011. Consumption expenditure continues to be constrained by relatively tight lending standards by banks, high levels of household debt, and consistently above-average increases in a range of administered prices which reduce the amount available for household discretionary expenditure. The gradual deleveraging by households has continued, with the ratio of household debt to disposable income declining further from 75,8 per cent in the second quarter of 2011 to 75,0 per cent in the third quarter, compared with a peak of 82,3 per cent in 2009. The decline in the ratio, however, reflects the fact that disposable income is increasing at a faster rate than debt accumulation. Trends in credit extension have remained subdued and more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC, with year-on-year growth in banks' loans and advances to the private sector measuring 6,0 per cent in both October and November. Mortgage advances remained relatively depressed in line with the weak state of the housing market, and increased by 1,9 per cent in November. The main drivers of credit extension in November were the 6,0 per cent increase in instalment sales credit and leasing finance, reflecting improved motor vehicle sales, and other loans and advances which increased at a year-on-year rate of 12,6 per cent in both October and November. This category was driven mainly by general loans which include unsecured lending. The main pressures on inflation continue to emanate primarily from cost push pressures. Administered prices remain a concern in the inflation outlook. The price of electricity has been an important driver of inflation, and increases of 17,3 per cent are assumed for both 2012 and 2013. However, the current NERSA determination ends in mid-2013 and subsequent price increases are yet to be determined. The case for further significant above-inflation increases is questionable. The determination of administered prices should not act as an inhibitor to growth and investment. International oil prices have been subject to conflicting pressures. Downside pressures have emanated from the weaker global growth environment, while upside pressures emanate from geo-political factors which have raised fears of possible supply disruptions. Nevertheless the price of Brent crude oil has been surprisingly stable and, despite some volatility, is at similar levels to those prevailing at the time of the previous meeting of the MPC. Domestic petrol prices decreased by a cumulative 16 cents per litre since early November, but the current under-recovery suggests that a further increase can be expected in February. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements amounted to 7,7 per cent in the first nine months of 2011, compared with 8,2 per cent in 2010. However there are indications that the downward trend in nominal remuneration may have reversed. According to Statistics South Africa, growth in average remuneration per worker increased by 8,6 per cent in the third quarter of 2011 compared with the same quarter in 2010, up from 6,4 per cent and 7,4 per cent in the previous two quarters respectively. Adjusting for declining labour productivity trends, this has resulted in growth in nominal unit labour costs increasing from 5,2 per cent in the first quarter to 8,3 per cent in the third quarter of 2011. These developments could pose further upside risk to the inflation outlook. Food prices remain a major driver of inflation, influenced by both local and global factors. Domestic food prices have been negatively affected by the recent depreciation of the rand, and a smaller-than-expected maize crop which contributed to the doubling of the domestic maize price over the past year. Futures prices of maize suggest that some relief may be expected during the first half of 2012. Furthermore, global food prices have been declining, with the FAO Food Price Index falling by 11,3 per cent in December 2011, compared to its most recent peak in February of that year. Nevertheless domestic food price inflation at the consumer level is expected to remain relatively high for some time. The MPC has reflected on the various risks to the inflation outlook and considers these risks to be fairly evenly balanced, notwithstanding the reality that the exchange rate remains a significant source of uncertainty. The main downside risk continues to emanate from global economic developments. The MPC remains of the view that inflation pressures are primarily of a cost-push nature, but is concerned that a persistent upward trend in inflation and prolonged breach of the inflation target could have an adverse effect on inflation expectations which could reinforce the upward inflation dynamics. However, the MPC is also cognisant of the slowing domestic economy and feels that given the lack of demand pressures, monetary tightening at this stage would not be appropriate. At the same time, the nominal policy rate is at a long term low and the real policy rate is slightly negative, indicating a monetary policy stance that is accommodative and supportive of the real economy. The MPC maintains a preference for a stable interest rate environment given the conflicting pressures on monetary policy at this stage. However the Committee will continue to monitor domestic and global economic and financial developments and the risks to the outlook, and remains ready to act appropriately to ensure the attainment of the inflation target over the medium term while being supportive of the domestic economy. The Monetary Policy Committee has therefore decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,5 per cent per annum."
Israel,2012-01-23,"To view this press release as a WORD fileBackground conditions. 23.01.2012 The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for February 2012 by 0.25 percentage points to 2.5 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was unchanged in December; the average of the forecasts was for an increase of 0.1 percent. Monthly data on a seasonally adjusted basis indicate that in the second half of 2011 there was a significant slowdown in the pace of price increases, and in annual terms the increase was below the lower limit of the target inflation range. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: One year forward inflationexpectations as calculated from the capital markets (break-even inflation)were 2.2 percent on average in January, a slight increase from the previous month. Inflation expectations for the medium term decreased slightly fromthe previous month, to 2.4 percent, and those for the long term remained 2.5 percent. Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now, based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, remained steady at 2.4 percent, and the average of forecasters' predictions of the interest rate in one year's time increased to 2.6 percent, from 2.3 percent last month. Real economic activity: Economic indicators that became availablethis month show a continued slowdown in activity and in demand. The Bank of Israel's Companies Survey for the fourth quarter indicates that business activity in the economy continued to grow at a moderate pace, similar to the previous quarter. The Purchasing Managers Index compiled by Bank Hapoalim and the Israel Purchasing and Logistics Managers Association declined in December to 42.7 points, continuing its November fall. The Central Bureau of Statistics Consumer Confidence Index forDecember indicates a negative balance of 20 percent, similar to its level of August 2011. The rate of vacancies, which reflects demand for employees, was stable at about 3 percent. Nominal wages increased 4.3 percent in August-October, compared with the preceding three months, and real wages increased 1.2 percent. The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast compiled in December projects an inflation rate of 2.1 percent in 2012, and an average interest rate in the last quarter of 2012 of 2.2 percent. GDP growth in 2012 is projected to be 2.8 percent. Budget data: There has been a trend since April of a decline in indirect tax receipts, and in July a similar trend began in direct tax receipts. The overall government deficit (excluding net credit) in 2011 reached 3.3 percent of GDP, compared with a planned 2.9 percent of GDP, and was above the deficit ceiling of 3 percent of GDP. Given recent government commitments, particularly in light of the expected growth rate in 2012, 2.8 percent, which is lower than the 4 percent growth forecast on which the budget was constructed, the Ministry of Finance projects the deficit in 2012 to be 3.4 percent of GDP, compared with a deficit ceiling of 2 percent, set in theend of 2010. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on December 25, 2011, through January 20, 2012, the exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar was almost unchanged, in contrast with the strengthening of most major currencies against the dollar; the shekelappreciated by 1 percent against the euro. The rates of interest on government bonds declined along the entire curve. Yields on unindexed government bonds dropped by about 5 basis points (b.p.) for most maturities, and yields on indexed bonds declined by 5-10 b.p. Makam yields decreased during the period by 5-10 b.p. along the entire curve, and the yield for one year decreased from 2.51 percent to 2.47 percent, this against the background of global trends and expectations of further cuts in the interest rate by the Bank of Israel, and despite the continued exit of nonresidents from makam. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in December, the M 1monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increasedby 2.4 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 10.6 percent. It seems that a trend change is taking place in the housing market. This month, too, the annual rate of increase in home prices moderated: in the twelve months to November home prices increased at a rate of 6.9 percent, compared with a rate of 8.5 percent in the twelve months to October, and rates of increase of about 20 percent in 2010. However, based onpartial data from the Bank of Israel Companies Survey, construction companies report a sharp increase in the difficulty of selling apartments. The effect of these moves, as well as landmarketing efforts by the Ministry of Construction and Housing and the Israel Land Administration, is expected to continue to be reflected in the future. The global economy: The macroeconomic data on the eurozone continue to indicate the start of a recession, the most prominent being Germany'snegative growth rate of 0.25 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011. In contrast, relatively positive macroeconomic data onthe US economy were published this month, in particular data relating to growth and employment, indicating a trend of recovery and growth. This wasevident in the successful issues of debt in European countries, including Italy. Spain and France, in the narrowing of the credit spreads of peripheral countries, and in rises in stock markets. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to reduce the interest rate to 2.5 percent for February 2012 is consistent with the interest rate policy that is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percentinflation a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel, the global economy, monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following were the main considerations underlying the decision: The indicators that became available this month show that the slowdown in activity and in demand that started during the second half of 2011 continues. Actual inflation over the previous twelve months continues to settle firmly within thetarget range. The Bank of Israel expects the rate of inflation over the previous twelve months to remain within the target inflation rangein 2012. Forecasters' inflation predictions for the coming twelve months and inflation expectations measured from the capital market are close to themidpoint of the target range. Data on economic activity in Europe are consistent with the assessments that the eurozone will slip into a recession in 2012. The risk of default of some European countries as reflected by the high yields on their bonds and their high CDS spreadswere expressed this month in the downgrading of the sovereign credit rating of major European economies. Some optimism has been evident recently in global financial markets, primarily against the background of steps taken bythe ECB, but uncertainty regarding the debt crisis remains high, which also affects the level of uncertainty about developments in the Israeli economy. Interest rates in the major economies are low, and the markets are not pricing in an increase in the interest rate in the coming year in any of the central banks of the large advanced economies. Home prices continued to decline at a moderate pace. The limitation that the Bank of Israel imposed relating to the permitted share of housing loans at floatinginterest rates reduces the effect of cuts in the Bank of Israel interest rates on the average interest rate on mortgages. The decision to cut the interest rate to 2.5 percent for February is consistent with the interest rate policy aimed at keeping inflation within theprice stability target range and is intended to support real economic activity, against the background of the slowdown in global demand. The Bank will use thetools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the asset markets. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on February 6, 2012. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was unchanged inDecember; the average of the forecasts was for an increase of 0.1 percent.Monthly data on a seasonally adjusted basis indicate that in the second half of 2011 there was a significant slowdown in the pace of price increases,and in annual terms the increase was below the lower limit of the target inflation range. Inflation for the whole of 2011 as measured by change in the CPI was 2.2 percent, close to the center of the target range of price stability (1-3 percent per year). The primary sources of the increase in the CPI in 2011 were the energy, rent, and food components, which increased at a rapid pace in the first half of the year. Over the whole of 2011 energy prices increased 9.5 percent, rents by 5.2 percent, and food prices by 2.3 percent. 23.01.2012 The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for February 2012 by 0.25 percentage points to 2.5 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: One year forward inflation expectations as calculated from the capital markets (break-even inflation) were 2.2 percent on average in January, a slight increase from the previous month. Inflation expectations for the medium term decreased slightly from the previous month, to 2.4 percent, and those for the long term remained 2.5 percent. Forecasters' inflation predictions for the next twelve CPI readings average 2.3 percent, similar to predictions last month. Expectationsfor the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now, based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, remained steady at 2.4 percent, and the average of forecasters' predictions of the interest rate in one year's time increased to 2.6 percent, from 2.3 percent last month. Views differ among forecasters regarding the timing of the next interest rate reduction. Real economic activity: Economic indicators that became available this month show a continued slowdown in activity and in demand. The Bankof Israel's Companies Survey for the fourth quarter indicates that business activity in the economy continued to grow at a moderate pace, similar to the previous quarter. The Central Bureau of Statistics monthly survey of business trends indicates a slowdown in business activity in December as well, continuing a slowdown trend which began in May 2011. The Purchasing Managers Index compiled by Bank Hapoalim and the Israel Purchasing and LogisticsManagers Association declined in December to 42.7 points, continuing its November fall. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased 0.2 percent in December. The Central Bureau of Statistics Consumer Confidence Index for December indicates a negative balance of 20 percent, similar to its level of August 2011. Goods exports increased in December, compared with November, with some recovery in exports in high technology industries, while goods imports declined 1.2 percent. The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for February 2012 by 0.25 percentage points to 2.5 percent. The labor market: Labor market data indicate a high level of employment and a low unemployment rate. The rate of vacancies, which reflectsdemand for employees, was stable at about 3 percent. Nominal wages increased 4.3 percent in August-October, compared with the preceding threemonths, and real wages increased 1.2 percent. Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of total wage payments, were 2 percent higher in December in nominal terms than in December 2010 (excluding the effect of legislative changes), a marked moderation from the pace of increase in the last two years.

The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: The Bankof Israel Research Department staff forecast compiled in December projectsan inflation rate of 2.1 percent in 2012, and an average interest rate in the last quarter of 2012 of 2.2 percent. GDP growth in 2012 is projected tobe 2.8 percent. The Research Department's assessment at the time of the forecast was that the housing component of the CPI (representing rents) will increase 4 percent in 2012. Budget data: There has been a trend since April of a decline inindirect tax receipts, and in July a similar trend began in direct tax receipts. The overall government deficit (excluding net credit) in 2011 reached 3.3 percent of GDP, compared with a planned 2.9 percent of GDP, and was above the deficit ceiling of 3 percent of GDP. Given recent government commitments, particularly in light of the expected growth rate in 2012, 2.8 percent, which is lower than the 4 percent growth forecast on which the budget was constructed, the Ministry of Finance projects the deficit in 2012 to be 3.4 percent of GDP, compared with a deficit ceiling of 2 percent, set in the end of 2010. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was unchanged in December; the average of the forecasts was for an increase of 0.1 percent. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on December 25, 2011, through January 20, 2012, the exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar was almost unchanged, in contrast with the strengthening of most major currencies against the dollar; the shekel appreciated by 1 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel remained nearly unchanged. Background conditions. The capital and money markets: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on December 25, 2011, to January 20, 2012, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by 3.2 percent, similar to increases in stock market indices in advanced and emerging economies. The rates of interest on governmentbonds declined along the entire curve. Yields on unindexed government bonds dropped by about 5 basis points (b.p.) for most maturities, and yields onindexed bonds declined by 5-10 b.p. The yield gap between Israeli 10-year government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities narrowed moderately to about 250 b.p. from 258 b.p. in the previous month. Makam yields decreased during the period by 5-10 b.p. along the entire curve, and the yield for one year decreased from 2.51 percent to 2.47 percent, this against the background of global trends and expectations offurther cuts in the interest rate by the Bank of Israel, and despite the continued exit of nonresidents from makam. This month there were no net withdrawals from mutual funds specializing in corporate bonds. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread remained nearly unchanged at 199 b.p. The Tel-Bond 20 Index increased by 1.5 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 Index by 2.5 percent. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was unchanged in December; the average of the forecasts was for an increase of 0.1 percent. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in December, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 2.4 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 10.6 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The balance of outstanding debt of the business sector increased in November by 1.8 percent, to NIS 777 billion. Outstanding credit to households increased by 0.5 percent, to NIS 362 billion. The balance of outstanding housing credit to households increased by 0.5 percent in the twelve months to November to NIS 257 billion. Housing credit advanced in the twelve months which ended in December was 3 percent lower than that advanced in the twelve months to November, continuing the decline from the peak level in May. The share of unindexed floating rate mortgages granted in December was 26.9 percent. Interest rates on both price-indexed and nominal mortgages declined. The housing market: Housing prices (rental rates), which are included in the CPI, declined by 0.1 percent in December. In the twelve months to December they increased by 5.1 percent, compared with an increase of 5.5 percent in the twelve months to November. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, declined in October-November by 0.3 percent, the third decline in succession. It seemsthat a trend change is taking place in the housing market. This month, too, the annual rate of increase in home prices moderated: in the twelve months to November home prices increased at a rate of 6.9 percent, compared witha rate of 8.5 percent in the twelve months to October, and rates of increase of about 20 percent in 2010. Activity in the construction industry continues to be strong. There were 42,682 building starts in the twelve months to October, compared with 43,766 in the twelve months to September, and the number of completions was 34,313, compared with the previous month's figure of 33,652. However, based on partial data from the Bank of Israel Companies Survey, construction companies report a sharp increase in the difficulty of selling apartments. The moderation in the rate on increase of home prices comes against the background of the continued increase in the number of building starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation. The effect of these moves, as well as land marketing efforts by the Ministry of Construction and Housing and the Israel Land Administration, is expected to continue to be reflected in the future. The global economy: The macroeconomic dataon the eurozone continue to indicate the start of a recession, the most prominent being Germany's negative growth rate of 0.25 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011. Investment houses' forecasts of growth in the eurozone in 2012 average a negative 0.7 percent, and concern over the negative impact of fiscal restraint on growth has increased. In contrast, relatively positive macroeconomic data on the US economy were published this month, in particular data relating to growth and employment, indicating a trend of recoveryand growth. Most data on the emerging market economies published this month were better than those of the previous month, but they still show a slowdown in the rate of growth. Against the background of the European Central Bank (ECB) liquidity tender in December, and despite the downgrading of the credit rating of nine European countries, a positive atmosphere prevailed in the markets. This was evident in the successful issues of debt in European countries, including Italy. Spain and France, in the narrowing of the credit spreads of peripheral countries, and in rises in stock markets. Nevertheless. Greece's situation, against the background of the difficulties encountered in the attempts to restructure its debt arrangements, poses a threat. Data on world trade show a continued fall in its volume in October, and forecasts of world trade growth were reduced. There was a very small increase in commodity prices this month, partly related to the developments regarding a boycott of Iran. Inflation forecasts for Europe and the US rose slightly this month, but are still very close to 2 percent. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to reduce the interest rate to 2.5 percent for February 2012 is consistent with the interest rate policy that is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent inflation a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel,the global economy, monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following were the main considerations underlying the decision: C 2B 7 The indicators that became available this month show that the slowdown in activityand in demand that started during the second half of 2011 continues. The slowdown in growth of Israel's economy is seen in exports and in domestic demand, against the background of weakness in the global economy and the significant uncertainty existing in the global environment, primarily around Europe. In addition, surveys of expectations, both of consumers and companies, show that the slowdown in the rate of growth is expected to continue. C 2B 7 Actual inflation over the previous twelve months continues to settle firmly within the target range. Inflation figures indicate a marked slowdown in inflation in the second half of 2011. The Bank of Israel expects the rate of inflation over the previous twelve months to remain within the target inflation range in 2012. Forecasters' inflation predictions for the coming twelve months and inflation expectations measured from the capital market are close tothe midpoint of the target range. C 2B 7 Data oneconomic activity in Europe are consistent with the assessments that the eurozone will slip into a recession in 2012. Figures of actual global trade show a continued volume decline in October. Forecasts for world trade growth in 2012 were revised downward. The risk of default of some European countries as reflected by the high yields on their bonds and their high CDS spreads were expressed this month in the downgrading of the sovereign credit rating of major European economies. Some optimism has been evident recently in global financial markets, primarily against the background of steps takenby the ECB, but uncertainty regarding the debt crisis remains high, which also affects the level of uncertainty about developments in the Israeli economy. C 2B 7 Interest rates in the major economies are low, and the markets are not pricing in an increase in the interest rate in the coming year in any of the central banks of the large advanced economies. The Fed, it will be recalled, declared that the federal funds rate will remain at a near-zero level till mid-2013 at least. The Bank of England and the ECB continued their efforts to increase liquidity. C 2B 7 Home prices continued to decline at a moderate pace. The limitation that the Bank of Israel imposed relating to the permitted share of housing loans at floating interest rates reduces the effect of cuts in the Bank of Israel interest rates on the average interest rate on mortgages. The decision to cut the interest rate to 2.5 percent for February is consistent with the interest rate policy aimed at keeping inflation within the price stability target range and is intended to support real economic activity, against the background of the slowdown in global demand. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the asset markets. The minutes of the discussions prior tothe above interest rate decision will be published on February 6, 2012. The decision regarding the interest rate for March 2012 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. February 27, 2012. Print Page. The main considerations behind the decision.

Hungary,2012-01-24,"At its meeting on 24 January, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 7.00%. In the Council's judgement, the Hungarian economy is likely be stagnant next year, with growth expected to resume only in 2013. The level of output will remain below its potential over the entire forecast period. As the effects of the indirect tax increases and the exchange rate depreciation wane, the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand is likely to become the dominant factor shaping inflation. The increases in VAT and excise duties are likely to lead to a significant increase in the price index in 2012. Fiscal compensation will cushion the effect of the inflationary effect of the minimum wage increase on labour costs; however, the weaker exchange rate, reflecting increased perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy, is leading to a deterioration in the inflation outlook. In addition to the consumer price index, the Monetary Council is also closely monitoring developments in tax-adjusted core inflation, which continues to indicate relatively modest inflationary pressures in the economy. The slowdown in global growth and the euro-area debt crisis point to a weaker outlook for activity in Hungary's export markets, which in turn may dampen export growth and contribute to a deterioration in the outlook for Hungarian economic growth. The escalation of the euro-are debt crisis and the risks faced by the European banking sector have led to a tightening in domestic credit conditions. In the current uncertain economic environment, the weaker outlook for growth and tighter credit conditions are restraining investment. Consumption is likely to remain persistently low, reflecting the weaker exchange rate, the uncertain prospects for income growth and the indirect tax increases. The Government's measures to ensure that the target for next year's budget deficit is met are also likely to act as a significant brake on domestic demand growth, but at the same time are necessary to improve Hungary's risk assessment. Recent events surrounding a loan agreement between the Government and the IMF have been the most important factor shaping perceptions about the economy: for example, the change in the Government's communication about its intention to submit a formal request for an IMF loan and statements by government officials in response to messages calling for changes to legislation found to be in conflict with EU law. Hungary's indicators continued to deteriorate as tensions between the Government and the IMF and EU increased. Subsequently, after reaching its height during the particularly turbulent period of 4 and 5 January, this negative trend reversed and began to improve with the Government's communication in favour of an agreement. The Government's increasing commitment to reach an agreement with the IMF and EU has resulted in an improvement in perceptions about the economy, with this improvement in perceptions becoming dominant in recent days. However, increased uncertainty and high market volatility have remained. Monetary policy can best contribute to economic growth by maintaining a predictable economic environment, ensuring price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system. If necessary, the Monetary Council is ready to use the instruments at its disposal to meet these objectives. In light of increased perceptions of risk and the upside risks to inflation, the Monetary Council has decided to leave the base rate unchanged. If perceptions about the economy and the outlook for inflation deteriorate significantly further, it may prove necessary to raise interest rates again. The Council's assessment of performance in meeting the inflation target in 2011. Annual average inflation was 3.9% in 2011, down 1% on the previous year. During most of the year, inflation fluctuated near the upper bound of the +/-1% tolerance band around the Bank's 3% inflation target. Unprocessed food and oil price shocks starting at the end of 2010 were the most important factors contributing to inflation remaining above the target in 2011 H1. Persistent rises in world food prices fed through into domestic processed food prices and domestic fuel prices began to reflect higher global oil prices. As a result of these effects, the consumer price index hovered near 4% in H1. The second-round effects of the cost shocks had only a modest impact on the consumer price index, due to the downward effects on prices and wages of weak domestic demand and loose labour market conditions. Although the consumer price index fell in H2 as the inflationary impact of the cost shocks waned and domestic demand remained weak, the increases in indirect taxes again led to a pick-up in inflation. The increase in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy beginning in late summer resulted in a sharp depreciation of the forint exchange rate, which in turn contributed directly to increases in the prices of imported goods. However, due to weak domestic demand, firms were able to increase prices of many products only to a limited extent. As a result, the inflationary effect of the much weaker exchange rate was modest overall. In the long term, monetary policy can best contribute to the predictability of the economic environment and economic growth by maintaining price stability and ensuring the stability of the financial system. The indicators of the longer-term inflationary outlook showed moderate inflationary pressures throughout the year. Under the monetary conditions maintained in 2011 and with domestic demand remaining persistently weak, the risk of inflationary shocks leading to longer-term second-round effects is low. The Monetary Council will continue its efforts to ensure that the consumer price index is consistent with the inflation target in the medium term."
India,2012-01-24,"Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2011-12 Press Statement by Dr.D. Subbarao. Governor 1. ""At the outset, on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. I have pleasure in welcoming all of you to this Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2011-12. A short while ago, we put out the monetary policy measures accompanying this Review. Based on an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, we have decided to: Cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks by 50 basis points from 6.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL). This will be effective the fortnight beginning January 28, 2012. This reduction in the CRR will inject around 320 billion of primary liquidity into the system. There is no change in the policy interest rate. Accordingly, the repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) remains at 8.5 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF, determined with a spread of 100 basis point below the repo rate, will continue at 7.5 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate, determined with a spread of 100 bps above the repo rate, at 9.5 per cent. Considerations Behind the Policy Move 5. Three major considerations have informed our decision to reduce the CRR. First, growth is decelerating. This reflects the combined impact of several factors: the uncertain global environment, the cumulative impact of past monetary policy tightening and domestic policy uncertainties. While some slowdown in the growth of demand was the expected outcome of our earlier monetary policy actions to contain inflation, at this juncture, risk to growth has increased. Second, even as headline WPI inflation is moderating, it is coming largely from a sharp deceleration in prices of seasonal food items. In respect of other key components, particularly protein-based food items and non-food manufactured products, inflation remains high. Moreover, there are upside risks to inflation from global crude oil prices, the lingering impact of rupee depreciation, and slippage in the fiscal deficit.2 8. The third consideration that informed our decision is that liquidity conditions have remained tight beyond the comfort zone of the Reserve Bank. Although the Reserve Bank has conducted open market operations, and injected liquidity of over 700 billion, the structural deficit in the system has increased significantly. This could hurt credit flow to productive sectors of the economy. The large structural deficit in the system presented a strong case for injecting permanent primary liquidity into the system. Monetary Policy Stance 9. The policy document also spells out the three broad contours of our monetary policy stance. These are: to maintain an interest rate environment to contain inflation and anchor inflation expectations; to manage liquidity to ensure that it remains in moderate deficit, consistent with effective monetary transmission; to respond to increasing downside risks to growth. Guidance 10. As has become standard practice by now, we have also given guidance for the period forward. In reducing the CRR, the Reserve Bank has attempted to address the structural pressures on liquidity in a way that is not inconsistent with the prevailing monetary stance. In our two previous guidances, we had indicated that the cycle of rate increases had peaked, and that further actions were likely to reverse the cycle. Based on the current inflation trajectory, including the fact that there is considerable suppressed inflation, it is premature to begin reducing the policy rate. The reduction in the policy rate will be conditioned by signs of a sustainable moderation in inflation. At the same time, the persistence of tight liquidity conditions could disrupt credit flow, and further exacerbate growth risks. In this context, the CRR is the most effective instrument for permanent liquidity injection over a sustained period of time. The CRR reduction can also be viewed as a reinforcement of the guidance that the interest rate cycle has peaked and that future rate actions will be towards lowering the policy interest rate. Having said that. I must emphasise that the timing and magnitude of future rate actions will depend on a number of factors. Policy and administrative actions, which encourage investment that will help ease supply constraints in food and infrastructure, are critical. Initiatives to narrow skill mismatches in labour markets will help ease the pressure on wages. The anticipated fiscal slippage, which is caused largely by high levels of consumption spending by the government, poses a significant threat to both inflation management, and more broadly, to macroeconomic stability. Expected Outcomes 14. We expect that today's policy action and the guidance we have given will result in the following three outcomes: First, liquidity conditions will ease. Second, downside risks to growth will be mitigated.3 Finally, medium-term inflation expectations will remain anchored on the basis of a credible commitment to low and stable inflation. Global and Domestic Developments 15. Our policy decision has been based on a detailed assessment of both the global and domestic macroeconomic developments. Let me begin with the global economy. Global Economy 16. Since the Reserve Bank's October Review, there have been significant changes in the global scenario. On the one hand, concerns over the sustainability of sovereign debt problem in the euro area have intensified. On the other, there are modest signs of improvement in the US. In the emerging and developing economies (EDEs), growth has been moderating, reflecting the sluggishness in the advanced economies and the impact of earlier monetary tightening. Overall, notwithstanding the signs of recovery in the US, global growth prospects have weakened since the October Review. In September last year. IMF projected that global growth during 2012 would be 4 per cent. We now expect it to be lower. Indian Economy 18. Moving on to the domestic economy, real GDP growth moderated from 7.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2011-12 to 6.9 per cent in the second quarter. This was mainly due to deceleration in industrial growth, while the services sector held up relatively well. GDP growth in the first half of 2011-12 slowed to 7.3 per cent, down from 8.6 per cent in the first half of last year. On the demand side, the contraction in fixed capital formation in the second quarter was the main factor behind the slowdown in growth. This pattern, should it persist, will hurt medium-term growth prospects, further aggravate inflationary pressures, and threaten external and internal stability. The global environment is only partly responsible for the weak industrial performance and sluggish investment activity; several domestic factors  the unhealthy fiscal situation, high interest rates and policy and administrative uncertainty  are also playing a role. In its October 2011 Review, the Reserve Bank projected GDP growth of 7.6 per cent for 2011-12, though with significant downside risks. These downside risks have since materialised. Accordingly, the baseline projection of GDP growth for this year is revised downwards from 7.6 per cent to 7.0 per cent. Looking ahead to next year, while we will put out a formal projection in our Annual Policy Statement in April, at this time, the Reserve Bank's baseline scenario is that the economy will exhibit a modest recovery next year, with growth being slightly higher than during this year. Inflation 23. Let me now turn to inflation. Inflation is beginning to moderate as projected despite the significant depreciation of the rupee. Headline WPI inflation, which averaged 9.7 per cent (y-o-y) during April-October 2011, moderated to 9.1 per cent in November and further to 7.5 per cent in December. The higher than expected deceleration in food inflation has provided some relief. In particular, food articles inflation has come down sharply from 8.5 per cent in November to4 0.7 per cent in December. The prices of vegetables have had a big role in this sharp decline. If we exclude vegetables, the decline in food articles inflation is modest - from 8.0 per cent in November to only 7.1 per cent in December. We should also note that inflation in protein items  ‘eggs, fish and meat', milk and pulses  remains high, evidencing the structural component of food inflation. Non-food manufactured products inflation continues to remain elevated and well above the comfort zone. While indicators of pricing power suggest that the moderating trend will continue, upside risks remain significant. The momentum indicator of non-food manufactured products inflation is yet to show a discernible downward trend. Accordingly, while the Reserve Bank's policy stance has to become more sensitive to growth risks, it also needs to guard against persistent inflation risks. Keeping in view the expected moderation in non-food manufactured products inflation, domestic supply factors and global trends in commodity prices, the baseline projection for WPI inflation for March 2012 is retained at 7 per cent as set out in our October Review. We have revised our estimate for growth downwards, but have not changed our inflation estimate. This runs counter to the expectation that a significant downgrade in the growth projection should lead to a downward revision in the inflation projection. Why has that not happened? That has not happened for two reasons. First, the rupee depreciation has been feeding into core inflation, delaying the adjustment of inflation to slower growth. Second, and very importantly, suppressed inflation in petroleum product and coal prices remains quite significant. Rationalisation of these prices is, of course, welcome for a variety of well-known reasons, but it will impact observed inflation in the short term. Our projection of inflation, accordingly, is based on the likelihood of some adjustments being made in these prices. What will be the inflation scenario in 2012-13? We will make a formal projection in our Annual Policy Statement in April. At this time, the Reserve Bank's baseline scenario for next year is that headline inflation may show some moderation, though remaining vulnerable to a variety of upside risks, to which I will revert shortly. Liquidity and Monetary Conditions 29. Liquidity management has been a major challenge for the Reserve Bank during this year. Liquidity conditions, which have generally remained in deficit, tightened further beginning the second week of November 2011, partly reflecting RBI's forex market operations and advance tax outflows around mid-December. The Reserve Bank is on record having said that it would like the LAF window to be in modest deficit, in the range of +/- 1 per cent of NDTL, which works out to around 600 billion. Current levels of access to LAF, at about 1,200 billion, are way beyond this band. To ease the tightness in liquidity, and consistent with its monetary policy stance, the Reserve Bank conducted open market operations (OMOs) aggregating to over 700 billion during November 2011-mid January 2012. While broad money supply growth during the current year has evolved along the projected trajectory of 15.5 per cent, non-food credit growth has now slipped below the indicative trajectory of 18 per cent. Keeping in view the increased government borrowings and the slowdown in private credit demand. M growth projection for 2011-12 has been 3 retained at 15.5 per cent, while non-food credit growth has been scaled down to 16.0 per cent. These numbers, as always, are indicative projections and not targets. Forex Market Developments 31. Before I turn to the risk factors, let me briefly touch upon the developments in the foreign exchange market, which remained under pressure in the third quarter of 2011-12,5 reflecting adverse global sentiments and moderation in capital inflows. The Reserve Bank took a number of steps to stimulate capital inflows and curb speculation, besides also intervening in the market, consistent with our policy of containing volatility and preventing disruptive movements. The Reserve Bank continues to closely monitor developments in the external sector and their impact on the exchange rate. We will take action, as and when appropriate. Risk Factors 32. Finally, let me turn to the risks to our projections of growth and inflation for 2011- 12. We have listed seven of these. first, sovereign debt concerns in the euro area pose a major downside risk to the overall growth outlook. the second major risk emanates from the slowdown of capital flows in the face of a widening current account deficit. third, global energy prices continue to pose a risk to growth and inflation due to geo-political factors and the global macroeconomic situation. fourth on our list of risks is that there are signals of increasing risk aversion by banks, which could adversely affect credit flow to productive sectors of the economy. fifth, inflation in respect of protein-based items remains high due to structural imbalances. In the absence of appropriate supply responses, risk to food inflation will continue to be on the upside. Next, there is a large element of suppressed inflation as domestic prices of some administered products do not reflect the underlying market conditions. Revision in domestic administered prices will add to inflationary pressures, although I should note that such revisions are necessary to maintain the balance between supply and demand. finally, the fiscal deficit of the government could potentially crowd out credit to the private sector. Moreover, slippage in the fiscal deficit has been adding to inflationary pressures and it continues to be a risk for inflation. Let me conclude by briefly reflecting on the critical area of fiscal-monetary policy coordination. Considering the egregious implications of large fiscal deficits, which are well- known, there is an urgent need for decisive fiscal consolidation, which will shift the balance of aggregate demand from public to private, and from consumption to capital formation. This is critical to yielding the space required for lowering rates without the imminent risk of resurgent inflation. The forthcoming Union Budget must exploit the opportunity to begin this process in a credible and sustainable way."" Ajit Prasad Press Release : 2011-2012/1185 Assistant General Manager."
Turkiye,2012-01-24,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 5.75 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 5 percent, lending rate at 12.5 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 12 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 15.5 percent. Recent data releases confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand is ongoing as envisaged. Final domestic demand is decelerating and the contribution of net external demand to growth is increasing. Accordingly, the rebalancing process and the improvement in the current account deficit would continue in the forthcoming period. The Committee has noted that annual inflation will stay at high levels in the short-term due to accumulated price increases that occurred during the final quarter of 2011. In order to prevent the potential second round effects, the Central Bank has delivered an important monetary tightening since October. Accordingly, domestic demand is expected to follow a moderate path in the forthcoming period, as suggested by recent trends in consumer loan growth and firms' domestic orders. Therefore, the Committee expects second round effects of the temporary price movements to remain contained and disinflation process to accelerate, especially in the final quarter of 2012 with the support of base effects. The Committee has indicated that tight monetary policy stance should be maintained for a while in order to keep inflation outlook consistent with the medium term targets. However, given the prevailing uncertainties regarding the global economy, it would be appropriate to preserve the flexibility of the monetary policy. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the amount of Turkish lira funding via one-week repo auctions will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. Moreover, considering the ongoing improvement in the current account dynamics and the sudden swings in global conditions, the Committee has indicated that intraday foreign exchange sale auctions will be more effective and more consistent with the monetary policy objectives, compared to the regular foreign exchange sale auctions. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Thailand,2012-01-25,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 25 January 2012 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announces the outcome of the meeting today as follows. The MPC assessed that the global economic outlook had weakened further. The euro zone is likely to enter a recession, undermining the authorities' ability to solve the sovereign debt problem in the region. On the other hand, economic conditions in the US improved, but limited fiscal policy space and continued weakness in the housing market would constrain economic growth in the periods ahead to remain below potential. Economic growth in Asia moderated slightly, as softer global demand tempered export growth in the region. The impact of the floods on the Thai economy was greater than previously assessed and the restoration process is likely to be more drawn out. The MPC projected that manufacturing production would return to normal by the third quarter of this year, supported by government measures, improving confidence, and accommodative monetary conditions. The positive momentum generated by these factors would help to limit downside risks to growth, especially the drag on exports from a slowdown in global demand. Inflationary pressure declined, reflecting a more prolonged recovery in domestic demand and a slowdown in commodity prices in line with weakening global demand. Nonetheless the boost to economic activity from reconstruction spending and various government stimulus measures could exert some upward pressure on inflation going forward. The MPC assessed that inflationary pressure remains contained, while headwinds from the global economy continue to pose risks to Thailand's economic growth. The MPC therefore voted unanimously to reduce the policy rate by 025 percent, from 325 percent to 300 percent per annum, effective immediately. With private sector confidence improving but still fragile, this policy accommodation should help accelerate the return of economic activity to normal levels."
United States,2012-01-25,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately, notwithstanding some slowing in global growth. While indicators point to some further improvement in overall labor market conditions, the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed, and the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has been subdued in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects economic growth over coming quarters to be modest and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that over coming quarters, inflation will run at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy. In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. The Committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September. The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Dennis P Lockhart; Sandra Pianalto; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Daniel K Tarullo; John C Williams; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M Lacker, who preferred to omit the description of the time period over which economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate."
Malaysia,2012-01-31,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. In the recent months, global economic and financial conditions have deteriorated following the escalation of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, the ongoing fiscal consolidation and the significant policy uncertainties. Heightened market volatility, impaired financial intermediation and weak labour market conditions continue to weigh down on growth in the advanced economies. These conditions pose downside risks to global growth. In Asia, while growth continues to be supported by sustained domestic demand, the growth momentum has moderated amid the weaker external environment. In the domestic economy, the latest indicators point towards continued expansion in the fourth quarter of 2011. Growth was driven by sustained domestic consumption and investment activities, while the external sector showed signs of moderation. Looking ahead, the economy is expected to continue to expand, underpinned by sustained private sector economic activity and further reinforced by public sector spending. Employment conditions are expected to remain stable while the outlook for domestic-oriented sectors continues to be favourable. Overall growth prospects, however, would be affected by the slowdown in external demand, resulting in slower growth in exports and industrial production. Domestic headline inflation averaged 3.2% in 2011. Going into 2012, the assessment is that cost-push inflation will moderate as slowing global economic activity will alleviate the pressure on the prices of key commodities. The impact of domestic demand factors on inflation is expected to be contained, in line with stable domestic demand conditions. Headline inflation, therefore, is expected to moderate in 2012. Nevertheless, risks to inflation could emerge arising from supply disruptions that would result in higher food and commodity prices. In the MPC's assessment, the global environment will become more challenging going forward. As Malaysia's economic growth and inflation prospects will be affected by these external developments, the MPC will continue to assess carefully the risks to domestic growth and inflation.

Czech Republic,2012-02-02,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 1st Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 2 February 2012 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.75%. Vice-Governor Mojmír Hampl did not attend the meeting and did not take part in the vote. Reasons for the decision Monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the target over the entire forecast horizon. Headline inflation will rise temporarily to just above 3% in 2012 owing to a VAT increase, but will fall back below the target at the start of 2013. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates in the near future and a modest decline thereafter. The message of the forecast baseline scenario Domestic factors (weak domestic demand and moderate wage growth) are currently curbing inflation. Food prices and the gradual pass-through of the depreciated exchange rate to prices are the main sources of inflation. Headline inflation will rise temporarily to just above 3% in 2012 owing to a VAT increase, but will fall back below the target at the start of 2013. Monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the target over the entire forecast horizon. The Czech economy will stagnate this year as a result of marked slowdown in external demand and continuing domestic fiscal consolidation. Next year, in connection with an external demand recovery. GDP growth will reach 1.9%. In the forecast, the nominal exchange rate is gradually appreciating from its currently weakened level. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates in the near future and a modest decline thereafter. Downside risks: additional fiscal consolidation measures Upside risks: faster growth in food prices Two-sided risks: economic developments abroad koruna exchange rate 13 Thank you for your attention More information about the forecast can be found at and in Inflation Report I/2012, to be published 10 February 2012."
Egypt,2012-02-02,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release February 2, 2012 In its meeting held on February 2, 2012, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 925 percent 1025 percent, respectively, and the 7‐day repo at 975 percen. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 95 percen. Headline CPI declined by 024 percent (m/m) in December following the 10 percent increase in Novembe. These monthly developments were largely driven by bottlenecks in the distribution channels of butane gas cylinders, along with tame price increases in some food items that were outweighed by declines in other. Despite the monthly decline, the annual rate increased to 955 percent in December from 907 percent in the previous month on the back of unfavorable base effects from last yea. On the other hand, core CPI inched up by 021 percent in December following the 017 percent increase in November reflecting sporadic increases in food price. Meanwhile the annual rate declined from 76 percent in October to 70 percent in November and December supported by favorable base effects from last yea. While the probability of a rebound in international food prices is less likely now in light of recent global developments, the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels pose an upside risk to the inflation outloo. Meanwhile real GDP grew by a mere 03 percent in 2011/2012 Q1 after a similarly feeble growth of 04 percent in 2010/2011 Q4, following the significant contrac(cid::415)on of 43 percent recorded in 2010/2011 Q3 due to the political events in Egypt and the regio. This mainly came on the back of continued weakening in the tourism, manufacturing, and construction sector. In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants over the past year, investment levels continued to deteriorate recording an annual retrenchment of 114 percent in 2011/2012 Q1. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover downside risks surrounding the global recovery have mounted on the back of fiscal and banking sector challenges facing the Euro Area and possible spillovers to other region. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. Given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks and the uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat A Sub Governor.

Romania,2012-02-02,"The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for February 7, 2012, along with a 12-month calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues. The annual inflation rate dropped to 3.14 percent in December 2011 from 7.96 percent in December 2010, in line with NBR forecasts, while the annual adjusted CORE21 inflation rate fell to 2.37 percent versus last year's peak of 4.77 percent recorded in March. This confirms the consolidation of disinflation, with the annual inflation rate reaching the target against the background of a prudent monetary policy stance, the fading-out of the first-round effect of the VAT rate hike, and of favourable trends in volatile prices, especially of food items as well as their impact on the prices of processed food products. Looking at domestic developments, statistical indicators reveal the persistence of negative output gap despite positive dynamics in exports, industrial and farming outputs, the current account deficit staying at sustainable levels, but also a gradual recovery of credit to the private sector. The external environment shows that uncertainties remain regarding the resolution of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, with impact on investors' risk aversion, capital flow volatility, as well as on global economic developments. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses developments in the recent macroeconomic environment and the inflation outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the period ahead. The new forecast reconfirms the perspective of inflation staying within the variation band around the 3 percent target throughout the projection horizon, which paves the way for preserving financial stability and enhancing the confidence of households and economic agents as essential pillars for a sustainable recovery of the Romanian economy. Risks associated to factors outside the central bank's influence  administered price adjustments, possible slippages in the implementation of fiscal policy and structural reforms, along with tensions related to the electoral context  persist. These risks, along with uncertainties regarding the external environment, capital flows, and developments in some volatile prices require a cautious calibration of monetary policy instruments to ensure price stability in the medium run, as well as financial stability. In this context, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 5.50 percent per annum from 5.75 percent. Thus, starting February 3, 2012, the annual interest rate on the deposit facility will be cut to 1.50 percent from 1.75 percent, while the overnight (Lombard) rate will be 9.50 percent per annum versus 9.75 percent previously. The NBR Board has also decided to further pursue an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and keep unchanged the minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The gradual and judicious adjustment of real broad monetary conditions will help effectively anchor expectations throughout the projection horizon given the outlook for inflation, namely a continued slowdown in both headline and core inflation in the immediately forthcoming period, but also the impact of the unfavourable statistical base effects on the evolution of inflation in the second part of 2012 (which should not trigger overshooting of the variation band around the 3 percent inflation target). The achievement of both price and financial stability, in the context of the fulfilment of commitments under the external financing agreements with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions, is essential for ensuring lasting economic growth. An increased absorption of European funds, along with a gradual revival of domestic demand will especially secure the sustainability of economic recovery. The NBR is restating that it will continue to closely monitor domestic and global economic developments in order to ensure, by accordingly adjusting its available instruments, the fulfilment of its objectives to achieve price stability, as well as financial stability. The quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for February 7, 2012, along with a 12-month calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues. 1 Calculated by the NBR by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index.

Russia,2012-02-03,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 3 February 2012 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain the refinancing rate and the interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations unchanged (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and risks of economic growth slowdown, including those associated with the global economic uncertainty. In January 2012 inflation decelerated significantly: as of 30 January the pace of inflation declined to 4.1% over year ago (6.1% at the end of 2011), which was due to the planned deferment of an increase in the majority of regulated prices and tariffs until the middle of 2012. The Bank of Russia takes into account the temporality of this effect and relies on medium-term inflation forecasts in making monetary policy decisions. Meanwhile, the ruble appreciation observed in January may have some disinflationary effect. The dynamics of the main macroeconomic indicators in December showed persistent firmness of consumption beside the moderate production growth figures. Further decrease in unemployment rate, high real income growth rate and the continued expansion in consumer credit contributed to the acceleration of retail sales growth. The growth rate of investment in production capacity increased in December. However, industrial production growth rate in year-over-year terms decreased sharply compared to November, which was partly explained by the decline in particular components of the index due to weather-related factors. Production growth rates and economic confidence indicators remained rather low in the recent months. Considering recent domestic and international macroeconomic developments the Bank of Russia judged that the current level of money market interest rates within the interest rate corridor was appropriate to balance the inflation risks and the risks of economic growth slowdown in the coming months. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor the effect of the tightening of monetary conditions resulting from the consequences of the transition to the liquidity shortage in the banking sector beside the deleveraging processes in the external financial markets. The next meeting of the Board of Directors on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the first half of March 2012. Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations(% p.a.).

Poland,2012-02-08,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 8 February 2012 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 7-8 February 2012 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate at 4.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 6.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 3.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 4.75% on an annual basis. In 2011 Q4 global economic growth remained low. Acceleration in GDP growth in the United States was most probably accompanied by stagnation in the euro area. Most major emerging economies saw some weakening of economic activity. Since the last meeting of the Council GDP forecasts for most economies have been further revised downwards. Yet, there have been signs of possible economic stabilization in some countries. Inflation abroad remains elevated, albeit recently it abated somewhat. High commodity prices which have been recently on the rise again are one of the main factors behind heightened inflation. Sentiment in the global financial markets improved which contributed to a considerable appreciation of emerging markets currencies, including the Polish zloty. Yet, uncertainty about fiscal crisis in some euro area countries continues and volatility in asset prices, including exchange rates, remains high. Preliminary data on GDP in 2011 in Poland confirmed that in 2011 Q4 relatively robust economic growth continued. Economic growth was most likely still driven by domestic demand. Consumption growth further declined, while recovery in investment intensified. Relatively low level of most leading economic indicators  despite recent improvement of some of them  suggests likely weakening of economic activity in the coming quarters. Unemployment rate in December remained elevated, while employment in companies declined. Wage growth in enterprises remained moderate. Lending to corporates continued to rise (in annual terms). Similarly, mortgage lending to households remained strong, though its growth rate slowed down. On the other hand, consumer lending continued to fall. Annual CPI inflation in December decreased to 4.6%, though remaining markedly above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. PPI inflation also saw some decline. At the same time, core inflation rose and inflation expectations of households and corporates increased. In the coming months, the annual CPI will continue at an elevated level. On the one hand, waning impact of VAT rate increases and considerable rises in food and energy prices observed in the first half of 2011 will be conducive to lowering annual inflation at the beginning of 2012. 00-919 Warszawa, ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, phone 22 653 28 88, fax 22 653 13 28 On the other hand, persistently high commodity prices in the global markets and the effects of earlier zloty depreciation will be supporting heightened price growth. Heightened inflation will also be driven by continuously high dynamics of administered prices. In the opinion of the Council, in the medium term inflation will be curbed by the gradually decelerating domestic demand. Decelerating demand growth will be driven by lower economic growth abroad, fiscal tightening in Poland and interest rate increases implemented in the first half of 2011. The impact of the situation in the global financial markets on the zloty exchange rate and, in particular, the sustainability of the appreciation of the zloty in the recent period, continues to add uncertainty to the inflation outlook. In the opinion of the Council, the monetary policy tightening implemented in the first half of 2011 supports inflation return to the target in the medium term, however the risk of elevated inflation in the coming months remains high. At the same time the recent domestic economic developments indicate that the expected demand deceleration in the coming quarters may prove weaker than previously anticipated. The March macroeconomic projection of the NBP will be helpful in the assessment of inflationary pressure in the medium term. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council does not rule out the possibility of further monetary policy adjustments in the future, should the outlook for inflation returning to the target deteriorate."
South Korea,2012-02-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers some economic indicators in the US such as employment to have shown improvements, but economic activities in the euro area to have remained sluggish. Growth in emerging market economies has continued to exhibit signs of weakening, due mostly to slowing exports. Going forward the Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be very moderate, and judges that risk factors still exist, stemming for instance from the persistence of the sovereign debt problems in Europe and the slumps in major country economies, and from geopolitical risks in the Middle East. In Korea, economic growth has slowed, with domestic demand subdued overall and exports also decreasing. On the employment front, however, the uptrend in the number of persons employed is being sustained, led by the private sector. The Committee anticipates that the domestic economic growth rate will gradually return to its long-term trend level going forward, although viewing downside risks as likely to remain high for some time due mostly to the impact of external risk factors. Consumer price inflation declined to 3.4% in January, owing chiefly to the base effect from last year, and core inflation also dropped compared to the previous month. In the coming months, factors including the easing of demand-side pressures will work in favor of price stability, but the Committee recognizes the presence of potentially destabilizing factors such as the ongoing high inflation expectations and the geopolitical risks in the Middle East. In the housing market, prices remained weak in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while leasehold deposits there maintained their levels of the previous month. Housing prices and leasehold deposits in the rest of the country rose at rates similar to those in December. In the financial markets, stock prices rose and the Korean won appreciated against the US dollar in line with the huge inflows of foreigners' securities investment funds as the international financial market unrest eased somewhat. Long-term market interest rates have continued to fluctuate within a narrow range. Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and economic risk factors both at home and abroad, as well as the evolution of inflation expectations, will conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the midpoint of the inflation target over a medium-term horizon amid continuing sound growth of the economy."
Chile,2012-02-14,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 14 February 2012 Monetary Policy Meeting  February 20121 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). Internationally, advanced economies are growing slowly. Some output and employment indicators in the United States have shown signs of increased dynamism, while in Europe indicators have worsened. Doubts persist about how problems will be resolved in the Eurozone economies, where fiscal and financial risks remain very high. Global financial conditions have improved somewhat, the dollar has depreciated in the international markets and commodity prices have risen. Domestically, economic activity and domestic demand have tended to outperform forecasts from the latest Monetary Policy Report. The labor market is still tight. Credit market conditions are stable. Y‐o‐y CPI inflation is slightly above the tolerance range, while core inflation measures have normalized. Inflation expectations remain around the target. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. 1 The Spanish original prevails."
Georgia,2012-02-15,"15.02.2012 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate Unchanged at 6.5 percent The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on February 15, 2012 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 6.5 percent. As was expected, annual inflation dropped further in January, reaching 0.5 percent. Core inflation (net of food and energy) has a declining trend as well. According to the existing forecasts, due to the base effect inflation is expected to decline even further in the first half of the year. Starting in June this trend is expected to be changed, although the inflation rate will remain below the target and will only reach target by the end of the year. Despite low inflation the real exchange rate had been appreciating in the end of last year. This is related to the faster nominal appreciation of the national currency vs. currencies of main trade partners. Real appreciation on one hand causes further widening of the trade deficit and on the other causes weakening of the demand. According to the preliminary information, the real GDP growth in the 4th quarter of 2011 was higher than expected, resulting in the forecast real annual growth of 6.8%. Of note, the remittances in January have also grown, with a 13.4% growth over last January. Based on the aforementioned factors and taking into account the current and expected dynamics of the macroeconomic indicators in the country, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on March 28, 2012."
Peru,2012-02-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2012 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent This decision takes into account the lower growth being recorded by some components of expenditure, the current international financial risks, and the rise of inflation associated mainly with temporary supply factors. Future adjustments in the reference interest rate will depend on the evolution of inflation and its determinants Inflation in January recorded a monthly rate of -0.1 percent, as a result of which the annual rate of inflation declined from 4.74 to 4.23 percent. Core inflation in January showed a rate of 0.22 percent and thus accumulated a rate of 3.68 percent in the last 12 months (a similar rate to the one recorded in December). Inflation excluding food and energy registered a rate of -0.13 percent and an annual rate of 2.33 percent (lower than the annual rate of 2.42 percent recorded in the previous month). The supply shocks that affected inflation last year are expected to continue to reverse in the following months, which should contribute to the convergence of annual inflation to the target range towards mid-2012. Thus, a rate of inflation of 2 percent is forecast for end 2012. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show a moderation of growth in the economy. For example, even though sales of electricity continued to grow in January, they showed a lower pace of growth than in December. Moreover, indicators of global economic activity have shown a better-than-expected evolution, but uncertainty in international financial markets persists and growth in 2012 is expected to be lower than in the previous year. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments on a prompt and timely basis The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Monetary Program for March will be approved on the Board's session of March 8, 2012."
Turkiye,2012-02-21,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to adjust the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been kept at 5.75 percent. b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been kept at 5 percent while lending rate has been cut from 12.5 percent to 11.5 percent. Interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been cut from 12 percent to 11 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been cut from 15.5 percent to 14.5 percent. Recent data releases confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand is ongoing as envisaged. Final domestic demand is decelerating while the contribution of net external demand to growth is increasing. Accordingly, the rebalancing process and the improvement in the current account deficit will continue in the forthcoming period. Starting from February, core inflation indicators are expected to follow a downward path due to favorable cost factors. Also considering the recent expansionary monetary policy decisions throughout the globe, the Committee has decided to cut the upper limit of the interest rate corridor. Yet, the Committee has indicated that the cautious monetary policy stance should be maintained for a while in order to keep inflation outlook consistent with the medium term targets. However, given the prevailing uncertainties regarding the global economy, it would be appropriate to preserve the flexibility of the monetary policy. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the amount of Turkish lira funding via one- week repo auctions will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2012-02-27,"27.02.2012 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for March 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was unchanged in January; the average of the forecasts was for a decline of 0.1-0.2 percent. The rate of inflation over the past 12 months was 2 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: One year forward inflationexpectations as calculated from the capital markets (break-even inflation)were 2.6 percent on average in February, a 0.3 percent increase from the previous month. With that, this series is affected by seasonal factors, due to a lack of continuous indexed bond series. Thus, the expectations estimate is apparently biased upward this month. Inflation expectations calculatedfrom the capital markets for the medium term were 2.5 percent, and for longer terms were 2.6 percent: an average increase of about 0.1 to 0.2 percent from the previous month. Forecasters' inflation predictions for thenext twelve CPI readings average 2.4 percent, an increase from their projections last month. Forecasters expect, on average, a cumulative increase of 1 percent over the next three CPI readings. Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now, based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, remained steady this month as well at 2.4 percent, and the average of forecasters' predictions of the interest rate in one year's time was 2.4 percent, compared with projections of 2.6 percent last month. Forecasters project that the Bank of Israel interest rate for March will remain unchanged. Real economic activity: Although economic indicators that became available this month show a mixed trend, the general assessment is that in the fourth quarter and in January there was a continued slowdown in the rate of growth of activity and of demand. These indicators are consistent withthe Bank of Israel forecast for growth of 2.8 percent in 2012. The first estimate of National Accounts figures for the fourth quarter (in annual terms) shows that GDP increased 3.2 percent, compared with 3.8 percent in the previous quarter; business sector product increased 3.3 percent, compared with 5 percent in the previous quarter, private consumption expenditure declined by 4 percent, compared with an increase of 0.2 percent in the previous quarter; fixed capital formation by industries declined by 3.1 percent, compared with an increase of 14.9 percent in the previous quarter; and exportsdeclined 17.4 percent, compared with a decline of 7.7 percent in the previous quarter. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased 0.2 percentin January. An analysis of the various components of the index (manufacturing production, trade and services revenue, and imports of production inputs) in recent months indicates stabilization and even slight improvement. Incontrast, goods exports declined 6.3 percent in January. VAT revenues fromdomestic production were stable, compared with a decline of 3.5 percent in the previous month. The Central Bureau of Statistics monthly survey of business trends and its consumer confidence indicator continued to be negativein January as well, though with some improvement. The Bank of Israel's Companies Survey for the fourth quarter indicates stability in the net balanceof activity for the second consecutive quarter. The labor market: Labor market data indicate a high level of employment and a low unemployment rate. The job vacancy rate, which reflects demand for employees, ranged from 2.5-3 percent. Nominal wages increased 1.4 percent in September-November, compared with the preceding three months, and real wages increased 1.1 percent. Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of total wage payments, were 5.1 percent higher in January in nominal terms than in January 2011 (excluding the effect of legislative changes), and despite an increase compared with December, there is still some moderation from the pace of increase in the beginning of 2011.New claims for unemployment benefits increased in December, continuing thetrend of increase since the middle of 2011. The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast compiled in December projects an inflation rate of 2.1 percent in 2012, and an average interest rate in the last quarter of 2012 of 2.2 percent. GDP growth in 2012 is projected to be 2.8 percent. The Research Department's assessment at the time of the forecast was that the housing component of the CPI (representing rents) will increase 4 percent in 2012. The Research Department noted that a continued increase in oil prices is expected to lead to an increase in inflation. Basedon its projections, an increase of ten percent in oil prices will lead to a gradual increase of 0.3 percent in the CPI. Budget data: Total tax receipts in January were NIS 2.9 billion above the seasonal path consistent with the tax revenues forecast in the budget. The better than forecast receipts were due mainly to one-time revenuesfrom direct taxes. In light of the projected growth rate in 2012 (2.8 percent), which is lower than the growth rate used in constructing the budget (4 percent), and given the pace of tax receipts net of one-time revenues, then to the extent that government expenditure: despite recent expenditure commitments by the government: does not deviate from the ceiling set by law, the deficit in 2012 is expected to be 3.3 percent of GDP, above the deficit ceiling of 2 percent of GDP set at the end of 2010. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on January 22, 2012, through February 24, 2012, the shekel appreciated against the dollar by about 0.7 percent, a much more moderate pace than the trend in most other economies. The shekel depreciated about 2.7 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel depreciated by about 1.2 percent. The capital and money markets: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on January 22, 2012, through February 24, 2012, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by 4.3 percent, in sharp contrast to the strong increases on stock market indices in advanced and emerging economies. The government bond market exhibited a mixed trend. Yields on unindexed government bonds increased by about 10 basis points (b.p.) for medium to long maturities, and yields on indexed bonds declined by about 25 b.p. for short terms, and with slight changes in other maturities. The yield differential between Israeli 10-year government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities widened moderately to 260 b.p. from 250 b.p. in the previous month. The interest rate reduction last month by the Bank of Israel, and the exit of nonresidents from makam, which continued this month, acted in opposite directions on makam yields. Makam yields decreased during the period by 5-10 b.p. along the entire curve, and the yield for one year was around 2.44 percent. The trend of money market fund withdrawals continued this month as well. However, corporate bond mutual funds, for the first time in a year, attracted net new investments, albeit at low levels. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-yearCDS spread narrowed slightly to 190 b.p., compared with 199 b.p. just before the previous interest rate decision. The Tel-Bond 20 Index increased by 0.7 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 Index increased by 0.45 percent. Yield gaps widened this month, a trend which stood out primarily among lower rated companies. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in January, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) declined by 1.2 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 10.9 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The balance of outstanding debt of the business sector increased in December by 0.2 percent, to NIS 779 billion. Outstanding credit to households increased by 0.5 percent, to NIS 364 billion. The balance of outstanding housing credit to households increased by 0.3 percent in December, to NIS 258 billion. Housing credit extendedin the twelve months ending in January was 2.1 percent lower than that advanced in the twelve months to December, continuing the decline from the peak level in May. The share of unindexed floating rate mortgages granted in January was 26.9 percent. Interest rates on price-indexed mortgages declinedslightly, and interest rates on nominal mortgages were unchanged. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (representing rents), increased by 0.3 percent in January. In the twelve months to January it increased by 5 percent. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased in November-December by 0.6 percent, the first increase after three months of decline in which the cumulative decline was 1.4 percent. In the twelve months to December, home prices increased by 6.1 percent, compared with a rate of 7.1 percent in the twelve months to November.</td> Activity in the construction industry continues to be strong. There were 43,535 building starts in the twelve months to November, compared with 43,221 in the twelve months to October, and the number of completions was 33,629 compared with the previous month's figure of 34,434. However, based on data from the Bank of Israel Companies Survey for the fourth quarter of 2011, construction companies report a sharp increase in the difficulty of selling apartments. The moderation in the rate on increase of home prices in recent months comes against the background of the continued increase in the number of building starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken bythe Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation. These moves, together with land marketing efforts by the Ministry of Construction and Housing and the Israel Land Administration, are expected to continue to have an effect in the future. The global economy: Global macroeconomic data presented a mixed picture this month. World financial markets exhibited a positive trend. Macroeconomic data in the US which were published this month continue to be encouraging, particularly employment figures, sales and production indices, and credit figures. In emerging economies, the trend was mixed. In Europe andJapan, macro figures continued to indicate a recessionary environment, which is forecast to continue during the current quarter. The various austerity measures in Europe and the deterioration in credit conditions are liable to exacerbate this path. This month, the aid plan for Greece was approved. The IMF revised its 2012 and 2013 world growth forecasts downward, to 3.3 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively, from 4.0 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, in its previous forecast. Additionally, the IMF revised downwardits forecast for world trade growth in 2012 to 3.8 percent, from 5.8 percent in its previous forecast. IMF economists point out risks to the continuation of the global economic recovery, chief among them the debt crisis in Europe. Central banks increased their activity in capital markets this month. World wide inflation remains restrained, though the continued increase ofcommodity prices, particularly oil, is liable to make continued recovery in economic activity difficult. Against the background of all these factors,the Bank of England and Bank of Japan took additional expansionary steps. In the next few days, the ECB is expected to adopt another LTRO plan to increase long term liquidity. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate for March 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent is consistent with an interest rate policy that is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel, the global economy, monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following were the main considerations underlying the decision: Inflation expectations from various sources, for the next twelve months and for longerterms, are within the inflation target range. However, in the past month they have increased by approximately 0.2 percentage points, to around 2.5 percent. Actual inflation over the previous twelve months continues to settlefirmly within the inflation target range. The indicators that became available this month support the assessment that in the fourth quarter and in January the slowdown in the rate of growth of activity continued. With that, some monthly indicators (such as the manufacturing production index, trade and services revenue index, and the index of imports of production inputs) point to slight improvement in recent months. Indicators of real economic activity are consistent with the Bank of Israel forecast of growth of about 2.8 percent in 2012. Data on global economic activity which became available this month presented a mixed picture, and financial markets exhibited some increase in optimism. In the US, relatively encouraging data were published. In emerging economies, data were mixed; in Europe and Japan, macro figures continued to indicate a recessionary environment, which is expected to continue in the current quarter as well. About a month ago, the IMF revised downward its 2012 and 2013 global growth and world trade forecasts, with its economists emphasizing the developing recession in Europe. Interest rates in major economies are low, and markets are not pricing in an increase in the interest rate this year by any of the central banks of large advanced economies. The Fed, it will be recalled, declared that the federal funds rate will remain at its near-zero level at least until the middle of 2014. The Bank of England and the ECB continued their efforts to increase liquidity. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in financial markets. The Bank will use thetools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the asset markets. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on March 12, 2012. Thedecision regarding the interest rate for April 2012 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. March 26, 2012. 27.02.2012 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for March 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent. The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for March 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent.

Hungary,2012-02-28,"At its meeting on 28 February, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 7.00%. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to pick up perceptibly in 2013. The level of output will remain below its potential this year and next. The consumer price index is expected to rise significantly, reflecting the effects of increases in VAT and excise duties as well as the depreciation of the forint exchange rate in the second half of 2011. However, low inflation dynamics due to weak domestic demand will be the main determinant of consumer prices as the effects of the indirect tax increases wane. In January, consumer prices rose more strongly than expected, due in part to the sharp increase in fuel prices and higher underlying inflation. Interpreting the January data is surrounded by greater-than-usual uncertainty, due to the indirect tax changes; however, uncertainty may decrease as new data become available over the next few months. In addition to the consumer price index, the Monetary Council is also closely monitoring developments in tax-adjusted core inflation, which also rose in January. The slowdown in global growth and the euro-area debt crisis point to a weaker outlook for activity in Hungary's export markets, which in turn will contribute to a deterioration in the outlook for Hungarian economic growth. It is difficult to judge whether the better-than-expected preliminary GDP release for 2011 Q4 reflects a lasting trend. While exports contributed to growth during the final months of the year, domestic demand is likely to have remained subdued in 2011 Q4. Looking forward, the uncertain global and domestic environment and the tightening in credit conditions will restrain investment activity. Consumption is likely to remain low, due to the uncertain prospects for income growth and tight fiscal policy. However. Government measures aimed to ensure that the deficit target is met are required for perceptions about Hungary to improve. There has been an improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy in the past month, as reflected in the appreciation of the forint exchange rate and the decline in risk indicators. This has been driven by favourable global developments, although country-specific factors related to expectations about an agreement with the IMF and EU have also pointed to an improvement. Risk perceptions have been highly volatile over the past few months. For this reason, the Monetary Council continues to consider it important that an agreement between the Government, the EU and the IMF is reached as soon as possible, in order to reduce the risks associated with financing the government debt. The Monetary Council has decided to leave the base rate unchanged. Monetary policy can best contribute to economic growth by maintaining a predictable economic environment, ensuring price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system. High volatility of financial markets over the recent period continues to warrant a cautious policy stance."
Philippines,2012-02-29,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to reduce the BSP's key policy interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility, effective immediately. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also reduced accordingly. This rate cut follows the 25-basis-points reduction in policy rates that was implemented in January of this year. The Monetary Board's decision was based on its assessment that the inflation outlook remains within the target range, with well-anchored inflation expectations. Latest baseline forecasts have continued to indicate that inflation is likely to settle within the lower half of the 3-5 percent target range in 2012 and 2013. The risks to the inflation outlook also appear to be broadly balanced, with the subdued pace of global economic activity expected to temper the rise in commodity prices. Meanwhile, the upside risks to inflation stem mainly from volatility to oil prices due to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and from the impact of strong capital inflows on domestic liquidity growth. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that domestic demand has continued to grow at a modest pace, reflecting mainly the impact of weaker external demand. Global economic conditions are expected to stay subdued as fiscal and banking sector headwinds in advanced economies affect global output growth and as market confidence remains fragile. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board is of the view that the benign inflation outlook has allowed further scope for a measured reduction in policy rates to support economic activity and reinforce confidence. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging demand and price developments to ensure that monetary policy settings remain consistent with price stability while being supportive of non-inflationary economic growth."
Poland,2012-03-07,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 7 March 2012 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 6-7 March 2012 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate at 4.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 6.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 3.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 4.75% on an annual basis. Global economic growth remains low. Acceleration in GDP growth in the United States is accompanied by a recession in the euro area and a slowdown in most major emerging economies. At the same time, since the previous meeting of the Council selected leading indicators have improved, what points to possible stabilization of economic activity in some countries. Yet, global economic growth is being hampered by the ongoing process of adjustments in the balance sheets of enterprises and households in some developed countries. Inflation abroad remains heightened, although is gradually declining. High commodity prices, including crude oil prices, which have been recently on the rise again, are one of the main factors behind elevated inflation. Uncertainty related to the sovereign debt crisis in some euro area countries has persisted. The Council got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute of the NBP, being one of the inputs to the Council's decisions on the NBP interest rates. The March inflation and GDP projection implies that GDP growth will decelerate in the coming quarters and  following global economic recovery  will start to rise again in mid-2013. At the same time, inflation will be gradually declining, coming close to the inflation target in late 2013. In line with the March projection based on data available up to 24 January 2012 (cut-off date for the projection)  under the assumption of constant NBP interest rates  there is a 50-percent probability of inflation running in the range of 3.6-4.5% in 2012 (compared to 2.5-3.9% in the November projection), 2.2-3.6% in 2013 (as against 2.2-3.7%) and 1.2-3.0% in 2014. In turn, with a 50-percent probability the March projection sees the annual GDP growth in the range of 2.2-3.8% in 2012 (compared to 2.0-4.1% in the November projection), 1.1-3.5% in 2013 (as against 1.5-4.0%) and 1.9-4.4% in 2014. Information incoming after 24 January 2012, including in particular lower than expected inflation in January and significant zloty appreciation, allow for the assessment that CPI inflation in 2012 and 2013 will be lower than indicated in the March projection of Economic Institute by respectively 0.3-0.4 and 0.2-0.3 percentage points. Data on 2011 Q4 GDP in Poland as well as data on output and retail sales in the early 2012 indicate that economic growth has remained robust. However, relatively low level of most leading business indicators suggests that economic activity may weaken in the coming quarters. At the same time, however, a rise in the number of the economically active contributed to a higher unemployment rate, which continues to curb wage growth in the economy. The substantial acceleration of wage growth in enterprises observed in January 2012 was probably due to temporary factors. Lending to corporates continued to increase. Yet, there was a decrease in lending to households in January, which was the result of further decline in consumer loans and slower growth in mortgage lending. According to preliminary GUS data, in January 2012 the annual CPI decreased to 4.1%, though remaining markedly above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. NBP estimates also point to a substantial decline in core inflation. In turn, inflation expectations of households and financial sector analysts  despite some improvement  remained elevated. Also growth of producer prices remained elevated. In the opinion of the Council, in the short term inflation  despite some expected decline  will probably remain above the NBP's inflation target. Heightened inflation will be supported by the previously observed zloty depreciation and persistently high commodity prices, which may lead to further rise in energy prices. In turn, in the medium term, inflation will be curbed by the expected deceleration of economic growth amid moderate wage growth as well as continued fiscal tightening. The zloty appreciation at the beginning of 2012 will also be conducive to lower inflation. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council does not rule out the possibility of further monetary policy adjustments in the future, should the positive signs of economic activity in Poland continue and the outlook for inflation returning to the target fail to improve. The Council has adopted the Inflation Report - March 2012."
Euroarea,2012-03-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since the beginning of February has confirmed our previous assessment of the outlook for economic activity. Available survey indicators confirm signs of a stabilisation in the euro area economy. However, the economic outlook is still subject to downside risks. Owing to rises in energy prices and indirect taxes, inflation rates are now likely to stay above 2% in 2012, with upside risks prevailing. Nevertheless, we expect price developments to remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. The underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued, consistent with contained inflationary pressures over the medium term. Looking ahead, we are firmly committed to maintaining price stability in the euro area, in line with our mandate. To this end, the continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations  in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term  is of the essence. Over recent months, a wide range of additional non-standard monetary policy measures has been implemented by the Eurosystem. These measures, including in particular two three-year longer-term refinancing operations, were decided upon against the background of exceptional circumstances in the last quarter of 2011. Together with fiscal consolidation and stepped-up structural reforms in several euro area countries, as well as progress towards a stronger euro area economic governance framework, they have contributed to a significant improvement in the financial environment over recent months. We expect that the three-year longer-term refinancing operations will provide further support for the ongoing stabilisation in financial markets and, in particular, for lending activity in the euro area. All our non-standard monetary policy measures are temporary in nature. Furthermore, all the necessary tools to address potential upside risks to medium-term price stability are fully available. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP contracted by 0.3% in the euro area in the fourth quarter of 2011. According to recent survey data, there are signs of a stabilisation in economic activity, albeit still at a low level. Looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to recover gradually in the course of this year. The outlook for economic activity should be supported by foreign demand, the very low short-term interest rates in the euro area, and all the measures taken to foster the proper functioning of the euro area financial sector. However, the remaining tensions in euro area sovereign debt markets and their impact on credit conditions, as well as the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors, are expected to continue to dampen the underlying growth momentum. This assessment is also reflected in the March 2012 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between -0.5% and 0.3% in 2012 and between 0.0% and 2.2% in 2013. Compared with the December 2011 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges have been shifted slightly downwards. They notably relate to a renewed intensification of tensions in euro area debt markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to further increases in commodity prices. Euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.7% in February 2012, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, slightly up from 2.6% in January. Looking ahead, inflation is now likely to stay above 2% in 2012, mainly owing to recent increases in energy prices, as well as recently announced increases in indirect taxes. On the basis of current futures prices for commodities, annual inflation rates should fall again to below 2% in early 2013. Looking further ahead, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain limited. The March 2012 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 2.1% and 2.7% in 2012 and between 0.9% and 2.3% in 2013. In comparison with the December 2011 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges for HICP inflation have been shifted upwards, notably the range for 2012. Risks to projected HICP inflation rates in the coming years are seen to be still broadly balanced, with upside risks in the near term mainly stemming from higher than expected oil prices and indirect tax increases. However, downside risks continue to exist owing to weaker than expected developments in economic activity. The monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. The annual growth rate of M3 was 2.5% in January 2012, up from 1.5% in December 2011. However, its annual rate (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) picked up slightly in January to 1.5% year on year from 1.2% in December. The annual growth rates of loans to non-financial corporations and loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.8% and 2.1% respectively in January. The volume of MFI loans to non-financial corporations declined only slightly in January, following the pronounced decline in December. By contrast, the flow of loans to households in January was positive. Following the signs of improvement in the financial environment, it is essential for banks to strengthen their resilience further, including by retaining earnings. The soundness of banks' balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating an appropriate provision of credit to the economy. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. Looking ahead, in order to deliver a favourable environment for sustainable growth and to support confidence and competitiveness, the Governing Council stresses the urgent need for governments to make further progress towards restoring sound fiscal positions and implementing the structural reform agenda. Regarding fiscal consolidation, many governments in the euro area are making progress. Continuing with comprehensive fiscal consolidation and complying with all commitments remains essential. In this respect, the 2012 European Semester should be used to enforce rigorously the reinforced fiscal surveillance mechanism. Equally important are structural reforms to increase the adjustment capacity and competitiveness of euro area countries and to strengthen growth prospects and job creation. The Governing Council strongly welcomes the European Commission's Alert Mechanism Report on macroeconomic imbalances and expects the proposed in-depth country reviews to actively support the reform processes under way in euro area countries."
South Korea,2012-03-08,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers some economic indicators in the US such as employment to have sustained their trends of improvement, but economic activities in the euro area to have remained sluggish. Growth in emerging market economies has continued to exhibit signs of weakening, due mostly to slowing exports. Going forward the Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be moderate, and judges that risk factors still exist, including the sovereign debt problems in Europe and geopolitical risks in the Middle East. For Korea, the Committee appraises economic growth to have not slowed further. Although construction investment has been sluggish, consumption and facilities investment have increased and exports have shown a steady expansion. On the employment front, the uptrend in the number of persons employed is being sustained, led by the private sector. The Committee anticipates that the domestic economic growth rate will gradually return to its long- term trend level going forward, although viewing downside risks as likely to remain high for some time due mostly to the impact of external risk factors. Consumer price inflation fell to 3.1% in February despite the rise in petroleum product prices, owing to declines in the prices of livestock products, and core inflation, which excludes the prices of non-grain agricultural products and petroleum products, also dropped compared to the previous month. In the coming months, factors including the easing of demand-side pressures will work in favor of price stability, but the Committee recognizes the presence of potentially destabilizing factors such as the ongoing high inflation expectations and the geopolitical risks in the Middle East. In the housing market, prices remained weak in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while leasehold deposits there rose. The rates of increase in housing prices and leasehold deposits in the rest of the country fell somewhat compared to the month before. In the financial markets, stock prices rose, long-term market interest rates increased slightly, and the volatility of the Korean won exchange rate diminished, as the international financial market unrest eased further. Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and economic risk factors both at home and abroad and endeavoring to lower inflation expectations, will conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the midpoint of the inflation target over a medium-term horizon amid continuing sound growth of the economy."
Malaysia,2012-03-09,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economic and financial conditions registered some improvements since the previous MPC meeting. Stress in the international financial markets has been partially alleviated by the introduction of measures to address the European sovereign debt crisis. In North America, there have been tentative signs of improvements in the economy. Notwithstanding these improvements, growth in the advanced economies remains subdued. In Asia, while growth continues to be supported by domestic demand, the growth momentum has moderated amid a slowdown in trade activity. In the domestic economy, latest indicators and surveys of businesses point to continued expansion in private consumption and business spending. Going forward, domestic demand will continue to drive the expansion of the Malaysian economy. Private consumption will be supported by stable employment conditions, income growth and public sector measures. Investment activity will be supported by the domestic-oriented industries, the commodity sector and the public sector. However, the overall growth momentum in 2012 is expected to moderate largely due to the weaker external environment. Headline inflation is expected to moderate in 2012. Nevertheless, upside risks to inflation could emerge arising from the risk of supply disruptions and the possible financialisation in commodity markets, which would result in higher energy and commodity prices. In the MPC's assessment, while global financial conditions have improved, downside risks to the global economy remain. The high global commodity prices continue to pose risks to inflation. The MPC will continue to carefully assess these evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook for growth and inflation. Schedule of MPC Meetings Due to the revised schedule of international meetings, the May MPC meeting will now be held on Friday, 11 May 2012 instead of the earlier date. Thursday, 3 May 2012. Bank Negara Malaysia 09 March 2012."
Russia,2012-03-13,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 13 March 2012 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain the refinancing rate and the interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations unchanged (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects, taking into account the global economic uncertainty. In February and in the beginning of March 2012 inflation continued to decelerate: as of 5 March the pace of inflation declined to 3.7% over a year ago. The pace of core inflation also declined to 5.7% in February. The deceleration of inflation was supported by the planned deferment of an increase in the majority of regulated prices and tariffs until the middle of 2012 and the ruble appreciation observed in the last months. Still the Bank of Russia relies on the medium-term inflation forecasts in making monetary policy decisions. The dynamics of the main macroeconomic indicators in January showed that the rates of growth in consumption were still higher than in production. Real wage growth rate remained high, partly due to its dynamics in the public sector of economy, while the rate of unemployment remained rather low. The consumer credit activity also stays robust. At the same time production growth rates remained moderate and economic confidence indicators kept rather weak in the recent months. Considering recent domestic and international macroeconomic developments the Bank of Russia judged that the current level of money market interest rates within the interest rate corridor was appropriate in the coming months. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor the money market conditions taking into account the deleveraging processes in the external financial markets. The next meeting of the Board of Directors on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the first decade of April 2012. Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations (% p.a.).

United States,2012-03-13,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately. Labor market conditions have improved further; the unemployment rate has declined notably in recent months but remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment have continued to advance. The housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has been subdued in recent months, although prices of crude oil and gasoline have increased lately. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects moderate economic growth over coming quarters and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Strains in global financial markets have eased, though they continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The recent increase in oil and gasoline prices will push up inflation temporarily, but the Committee anticipates that subsequently inflation will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy. In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. The Committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September. The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Dennis P Lockhart; Sandra Pianalto; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Daniel K Tarullo; John C Williams; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M Lacker, who does not anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate through late 2014."
Chile,2012-03-15,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 15 March 2012 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). Internationally. U.S. economic indicators have improved in the past few months, while Eurozone data confirms weak growth in that region. The dynamism of Asian economies—particularly China—has moderated in recent months. Risks in the Eurozone remain high, but tensions have subsided in the financial markets while the sovereign debt of Greece was swapped. Meanwhile, there has been an improvement in global financial conditions. The oil price has risen further. Domestically, economic activity and domestic demand have tended to outperform forecasts from the latest Monetary Policy Report. The labor market remains tight and nominal wages show increased dynamism. Credit market conditions are stable. Y‐o‐y CPI inflation is above the tolerance range, while core inflation measures are around 3% annually. Short term inflation expectations have risen, but remain around the target over the projection horizon. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the effects of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. __The Spanish original prevails."
India,2012-03-15,"Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: March 2012 Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of the current macroeconomic assessment, it has been decided to: keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.75 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities; and keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.5 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.5 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 9.5 per cent. Introduction 2. The Reserve Bank reduced the CRR by 75 basis points from 5.5 per cent to 4.75 per cent effective March 10, 2012. This measure was necessitated ahead of this scheduled Mid-Quarter Review to address the persistent structural liquidity deficit beyond the Reserve Bank's comfort level, which would have further worsened during the week of March 12-16 due to advance tax outflows. Global Economy 3. Since the Reserve Bank's Third Quarter Review (TQR) of January 24, 2012, there has been modest improvement in the global macroeconomic situation. The recent macroeconomic data for the US economy show some positive signs. In particular, labour market conditions have improved. The immediate financial market pressures in the euro area have been alleviated to some extent by the European Central Bank (ECB) injecting liquidity of more than one trillion euro through the two long-term refinancing operations. Growth in the euro area, however, turned negative in Q4. The emerging and developing economies (EDEs) are showing signs of growth slowdown. As a result, the global growth for 2012 and 2013 is expected to be lower than earlier anticipated. Inflation pressures in both advanced economies and EDEs moderated towards the end of 2011 on account of subdued domestic demand and correction in non-fuel commodity prices. Global crude prices, however, have spiked suddenly reflecting both geo-political concerns and abundant global liquidity, accentuating the risks to growth and inflation. Domestic economy Growth 6. GDP growth [year-on-year (y-o-y)] decelerated to 6.1 per cent in Q3 of 2011-12 from 6.9 per cent in Q2 mainly reflecting a slowdown in industrial activity. On the expenditure side, the growth moderation was mainly due to a deceleration in investment activity and weak external demand. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) has estimated the full year growth for 2011-12 at 6.9 per cent, which is in line with the Reserve Bank's projection. Growth in industrial production, as reflected in the index of industrial production (IIP), moderated to 4.0 per cent during 2011-12 (April-January) from 8.3 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago. While growth in the capital goods and intermediate goods sectors was negative, growth in the basic goods and consumer goods sectors decelerated marginally. Given the significant volatility in IIP numbers, the Reserve Bank also uses several other indicators to assess the overall industrial activity. The Manufacturing PMI for February suggested that industrial activity remained in an expansionary mode. While corporate sales growth in Q3 of 2011-12 was robust, margins moderated, reflecting increasing difficulty in passing on rising input prices. 23-month moving average inflation rate) also showed a moderating trend. Notably. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation (as measured by the new series, base year 2010) for the month of January 2012 was 7.7 per cent suggesting that price pressures persist at the retail level. Fiscal Situation 12. The Centre's fiscal conditions deteriorated during 2011-12 (April- January) with key deficit indicators already crossing the budget estimates for the full year. Apart from sluggishness in tax revenues. Government's non-plan expenditure, particularly subsidies, increased sharply. As indicated in the TQR, the slippage in the fiscal deficit has been adding to inflationary pressures. Credible fiscal consolidation, therefore, will be an important factor in shaping the inflation outlook. Money. Credit and Liquidity Conditions 347 billion during November 2011- March 9, 2012 and reduced the CRR by 125 basis points (50 basis points effective January 28 and 75 basis points effective March 10), injecting primary liquidity of about 800 billion. The liquidity situation has since improved and it is expected to ease further in the weeks ahead. External sector 14. While merchandise exports growth decelerated, moderation in imports growth was less pronounced leading to a widening of the trade deficit. After the TQR, the rupee has moved in a range of 48.69 to 50.58 per USD. With sluggish demand conditions in the advanced economies impeding exports growth and crude oil prices rising sharply, the current account deficit (CAD) is likely to remain high. The financing of the CAD will continue to pose a challenge so long as the global situation remains uncertain. Outlook 15. While the recovery in the US has been progressing, economic activity in the euro area has contracted. Although abundant liquidity injection by the ECB has mitigated the immediate pressures in financial markets, a credible solution to the sovereign debt problem is yet to emerge. Sluggish global economic activity, uncertainty in the euro area and rising crude oil prices will hamper growth prospects of EDEs. On the domestic front, while most indicators suggest that the economy is slowing down, the performance in Q4 of 2011-12 is expected to be better than that in Q3. Inflation has broadly evolved along the projected trajectory so far. However, upside risks to inflation have increased from the recent surge in crude oil prices, fiscal slippage and rupee depreciation. Besides, there continues to be significant suppressed inflation in fuel, fertilizer and power as administered prices do not fully reflect the costs of production."
Peru,2012-03-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2012 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent This decision takes into account the lower growth being recorded by some components of expenditure, the current international financial risks, and inflation's deviation from the target due mainly to transitory supply factors. Future adjustments in the reference interest rate will depend on the evolution of inflation and its determinants Inflation in February recorded a monthly rate of 0.32 percent, as a result of which the annual rate of inflation declined from 4.23 to 4.17 percent. Core inflation in February showed a rate of 0.32 percent and thus accumulated a rate of 3.79 percent in the last 12 months. Inflation excluding food and energy registered a rate of 0.07 percent and an annual rate of 2.23 percent. Even though rises are being observed in the international prices of fuels, the annual rate of inflation is expected to converge towards the target range around mid-2012. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show a moderation of growth in the economy. On the other hand, indicators of global economic activity have shown a better- than-expected evolution, but uncertainty in international financial markets persists and growth in 2012 is expected to be lower than in the previous year. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments on a prompt and timely basis The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Monetary Program for April will be approved on the Board's session of April 12, 2012."
Mongolia,2012-03-19,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Ref No: 2012/3 Valid from: March 19, 2012 Embargo: Not for publication or broadcast before 1100 hours on Friday, 19 March 2012. March 19, 2012 - BoM Board of Directors decided to increase the policy rate by 0.5 unit percent to 12.75%. The National Statistical Office of Mongolia reported that the national CPI increased to 12.5% and the Ulaanbaatar CPI was to 13.3% in February 2012. The economy of Mongolia is being affected by the inflation activating negative effects of supply in 2012. The price of meat was increased by 29.6% and it was the 58% of inflation in first two months. The cost of fuel was increased by 15.6%. Therefore, the price of non-food products was increased by 2.4%. These indexes prove that the inflation on demand does not decrease. The budget amendment is raising the excess demand and enhancing the inflation on demand and supply. Thus the Bank of Mongolia is tightening the policy rate to slow down the inflation and decrease the pressure on MNT rate against foreign exchanges. In the future, the Bank of Mongolia stands ready to take all the proper actions in urgent times. BANK OF MONGOLIA."
Nigeria,2012-03-19,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 82 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of Monday and Tuesday March 19 and 20, 2012 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on March 19 and 20, 2012 with 10 members in attendance to review domestic and international economic and financial conditions with a view to addressing monetary policy challenges in the short-to medium-term. The International Economic Situation The outlook of the international economic environment has improved slightly, when compared with 2011. The US. economy is showing signs of recovery and is expected to post over 2 per cent growth in 2012 compared with 17 per cent in 2011. There are, however, lingering global security concerns, particularly with respect to the face-off between the Iranian authorities on the one hand and the governments of the US. Europe and Israel on the other. An escalation of conflict may threaten global energy supplies and introduce shocks into the current environment. The Eurozone countries‟ economic outlook remained uncertain, particularly owing to the loss of momentum in growth by the end of 2011. The Eurozone countries posted a negative growth of 03 per cent in Q4 compared with gains of 02 per cent and 01 per cent in the preceding two quarters. The recent estimate indicated that the Euro area may post a negative growth of 03 per cent in 2012 against the estimated 14 per cent in 2011. The sovereign debt problem of the highly-indebted 1 countries of the Eurozone, however, seems to be coming under control with supportive actions from creditors, in particular the European Central Bank (ECB) and the IMF, which also boosted liquidity and sentiment in the financial markets. The economic prospects of the United Kingdom also seem to have improved recently partly owing to the financial support given by the ECB to the financial markets and partly due to news of the incipient signs of improvement in the economy of the US. The changed monetary stance of the ECB has clearly provided the short term support needed to restore confidence and kick-start recovery subject to improvements in fiscal balance sheets and competitiveness in the European periphery. In emerging economies, there is clear evidence of a slowdown. China posted 89 per cent growth in Q4 2011, the lowest since Q2 2009. It is expected that China‟s growth will slow down further in the current quarter going by the weak industrial production gains in January and February and the low retail sales. Consequently China has revised its growth target for 2012 downward from 80 per cent to 75 per cent. In India, growth in the quarter ending December 2011 was lower at 61 per cent compared with 69 per cent in the preceding quarter. Inflation rose in February 2012 with the result that inflation in 2011-12 could well be slightly above 7 per cent. However the latest official estimate of growth for 2012-13 is 76 per cent. This is partly attributed to expected improvement in the fiscal position and 2 somewhat relaxed monetary policy. Brazil‟s growth in Q4 of 2011 was 247 per cent and is expected to slow down further in 2012. For the year as a whole. Brazil recorded a mere 27 per cent as against 75 per cent in 2010. Inflation was 58 per cent in February 2012. The concerns around slowdown in the growth of these leading emerging market economies are however mitigated by the relatively positive outlook in the advanced economies. The Committee noted that oil prices are likely to be stable in the short-to medium term, with a possibility of volatility induced by any deterioration of peace conditions in the Middle East. The risk of a sharp decline in oil price is significantly lower today than it was at the last MPC. However, there is a need to guard against complacency. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has revised the data on national accounts for 2010 and 2011. In Quarter 4 of 2011, real GDP grew by 768 per cent, higher than 730 per cent in the preceding quarter but lower than the 860 per cent of the corresponding quarter of 2010. For the year as a whole, real GDP growth has been lower for all the quarters in 2011 than in the corresponding quarters of 2010. The Committee noted that real non-oil GDP recorded a robust growth of 885 per cent in 2011 as against 851 per cent in 2010. Crude oil output growth recorded a decline of 057 per cent in 3 2011. In the non-oil sector, agriculture decelerated mildly: its growth was 571 per cent in 2011 compared with the growth of 582 per cent in 2010. The main contributions to non-oil growth in 2011 were wholesale and retail trade, services, building and construction, and minerals and manufacturing. In general, the negative growth in the oil and gas and slowdown in agriculture are pointers to the need for implementation of the appropriate reforms in the agricultural and petroleum sectors. Prices The Committee noted the resurgence of inflationary threat starting in January after it had moderated towards the end of 2011. The NBS data on prices shows that the headline inflation in February 2012 stood at 119 per cent, lower than 126 per cent in January but higher than 103 per cent in December 2011. Food inflation on year on year basis was 129 per cent in February compared with 131 per cent in January and 110 per cent in December. The year-on-year core inflation was high at 135 per cent in February relative to 127 per cent in January and 108 per cent in December. The moderation in food inflation has helped to lower headline inflation. The rise in core inflation, however, must be kept in view in the formation of inflationary expectations. Given the partial removal of fuel subsidy in January the moderation in inflation in February is 4 probably attributable to a number of variables including: reallocation of spending by consumers due to higher expenditure on transport and fuel; the slowdown in monetary aggregates and fiscal spending; the stable and strengthening exchange rate of the naira; seasonal effect of food prices and statistical base effects. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments The provisional data on broad money supply (M2) for February shows that it grew by 134 per cent on year on year basis compared with 154 per cent in 2011. M1 grew at a faster pace of 191 per cent on year on year basis mainly owing to the strong growth of demand deposits. However relative to December 2011 levels, both broad money (M2) and narrow money (M1) declined. Foreign assets (net) and domestic credit (net) both increased on year-on-year basis. However over the December level, net foreign assets grew modestly by 115 per cent whereas the domestic credit declined by 19 per cent. The Committee urged the Central Bank of Nigeria to monitor closely the credit developments and ensure that the private sector gets adequate credit from deposit money banks so that the current growth momentum is not impeded by lack of adequate finance. The Committee noted that money market rates have been moving around the upper limit of the corridor. The average OBB rate was 1391 per cent in January and 1364 per cent in February. The average call rates in January and February months were 1418 per 5 cent and 1429 per cent, respectively. The overall stability in the money market rates was essentially a reflection of the effectiveness of monetary policy implementation. The spread between the average maximum lending rates and the weighted average rate on all categories of deposits fell marginally from 2012 percentage points in December 2011 to 1994 percentage points in January and further to 1970 percentage points in February 2012. External Sector Developments Foreign exchange reserves amounted to US$3543 billion as at March 14, 2012. This is an improvement over the level of US$ 3264 billion at end-December 2011. The exchange rate at the wDAS auctions moved from US$/N1586205 at the end of January 2012 to US$/N1576206 as on March 14, 2012. This partly reflected the moderation in the demand for foreign exchange due to increased inflows and reduced demand. The exchange rate at the inter-bank market appreciated significantly from US$/N16160 as at end January to US$/N15770 as at March 14, 2012. The rate charged by BDCs also appreciated from US$/N16300 to US$/N16000 during the same period. As a result, the premium between the wDAS rate and the rates in the other segments of the market declined substantially over the period. The Committee held the view that the improvement in the inflow of foreign exchange partly owing to the current high crude oil prices in 6 the international markets and the general improvement in the policy environment to attract capital flows influenced the observed trends in the external sector. It urged the Central Bank of Nigeria to build up adequate external reserves to satisfy the genuine needs for foreign exchange consistent with the increase in the growth in economic activity and the need to conserve resources and to withstand external shocks. The Committee’s Considerations The Committee noted that the underlying inflationary pressure from supply shocks would have been more severe had there been no mitigating factors on the demand side. Currently aggregate credit and broad money (M2) have been on the decline and there are signs of improving fiscal position with some control over expenditure and no imminent increase in wages. The fiscal stance and the absence of second-round effects of fuel subsidy removal have therefore complemented the monetary stance to dampen demand. The situation is further supported by stable exchange rates and stable international commodity prices which combine to moderate imported inflation. The Committee recognized that in light of increasingly benign global environment, it is imperative to ensure that the current growth path is sustained. It noted the relative stability in the foreign exchange market as well as the modest accretion to external reserves during 7 the period. In view of the poor accretion to reserves in 2011 and the need to continue to build buffers for the economy in an uncertain environment, the Committee strongly endorsed the stance of the Bank to focus on building reserves, defending the stability of the currency and providing conditions that are conducive to the inflow of FDI. The Committee noted with satisfaction the introduction of some fiscal and structural measures that could improve the revenue base of the government as well as enhance the capacity of the domestic economy to improve the value chain in the production process. Some of these measures include introduction of cost reflective electricity tariffs and progress in agricultural transformation initiatives. Although these measures would have a salutary effect on the fiscal position, they may, in the short run, put pressure on domestic prices. Consequently it is important for both monetary and fiscal authorities to put in place coordinated measures that would moderate the increase in the general level of domestic prices in the short to medium term. The Committee is also concerned about the rising level of domestic debt and its sustainability, as shown by the average debt service to revenue ratio of 176 per cent in the last three years. This would likely have a negative impact on domestic interest rates and the flow of credit to the core private sector, among others. Although debt to GDP ratio in 2011 stood at 178 per cent, the Committee noted that the percentage of debt service to 8 government revenue was a high 191 per cent in the same year. In view of the high interest rate environment occasioned by tight monetary policy stance, a moderation in government borrowing would be positive not just for the fiscal position but for access to finance by the private sector. After reviewing the overall fiscal position the committee commended the fiscal authorities for the discipline being introduced into government spending, the tightening of fiscal controls and the renewed focus on spending on capital projects. In arriving at its decision, the Committee was faced with a choice between two options. One option was to consider, in view of the improving global economic environment, a moderation in headline inflation, slowdown in monetary aggregates and fiscal spending and the crowding out effects of high interest rates, a reduction in the policy rate. This argument was considered but rejected on the basis of a number of factors. These included persistent underlying core inflationary pressures, the need to continue supporting the naira and build up external reserves, the necessity for attracting and retaining foreign investment and the need for consistency and stability in the macroeconomic environment. The Bank also needs to maintain its clear focus on price stability and it is not evident that a moderation in February is sufficient to establish a trend, and warrant a reversal of monetary tightening. Decisions: In the light of the above, and considering the clear impact of previous tightening on the rate of inflation and exchange rates up to February 2012, the Committee unanimously decided as follows: 1. Retain MPR at 120 per cent with interest rate corridor of +/- 200 basis points; 2. Retain CRR at 80 per cent; 3. Retain minimum liquidity Ratio of 300 per cent; and The Committee also resolved to watch closely developments with respect to the fiscal stance and to respond appropriately if, and when, the need arises. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria March 20, 2012 10 PERSONAL STATEMENTS BY MPC MEMBERS: 10 ALADE. SARAH Although headline inflation moderated to 119 percent in February 2012, down from 126 percent recorded in January 2012, inflation still remains a threat as the full effect of the subsidy removal has not worked its way through the economy. GDP growth in the last quarter of 2011 was lower than expected at 768 percent against the estimated 846 percent, suggesting a moderation in economic activities. Money market rates indicate tight liquidity conditions as interbank rates and other interest rates have trended upwards, constraining private sector growth and hampering job creation. All these would suggest monetary easing. However inflation remains a threat as both core and food inflation rose and further increase is expected as the planting season is about to commence. In addition, tight monetary policy has contributed to attracting foreign inflow and created stability in foreign exchange rate market. Therefore given these developments I will support a “no change” in monetary policy rate. Headline inflation decreased slightly in February, although inflation remains a threat. Inflation stood at 119 in February 2012 as against 126 percent recorded in January 2012. This decline in headline inflation suggests that the initial effect of the partial oil subsidy removal is weaning, therefore foreclosing the fear of second-round inflationary effect resulting from the policy. Food inflation increased slightly to 63 percent in February from 56 percent in January 2012, reflecting the seasonal effect of food prices in Nigeria. Staff projections indicate a rise in inflation in the near term due to seasonality in food supply/prices, consequently, the preemptive tightening stance adopted by the Bank in 2011 calls for a continued pause to allow for the full effect of the policy and to 11 address declining growth concerns. However as planting season commence, the threat of expected heightened inflation should not be overlooked. The 2012 budget passed by the National Assembly although higher than the proposed budget submitted by the Executive, still maintained deficit financing of less than 3 percent of GDP. The 2012 budget passed recently by the joint session of the National Assembly has a budget deficit of 296 percent of GDP still within the threshold of 3 percent of GDP stipulated in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2007. It also has the crude oil production target of 248 bpd, and oil benchmark of $72 per barrel. Although the budget passed by the National Assembly is higher than the amount submitted by the Executive, the magnitude of the increase does not justify an increase in monetary policy rate in the face of declining growth, stable exchange rate and tight liquidity conditions in the market. According to World Economic Outlook (WEO), oil price is expected to remain high in international market on the back of disrupted supply in the Middle East and renewed recovery in the United States. If the budget is implemented as passed without further increase, the inflationary pressure coming from the budget implementation will largely be contained. Developments in the domestic money market indicate tight liquidity conditions. Money market rates continue to trend upwards as interbank lending rate reached 1597 percent in February 22nd, 2012. Similarly average OBB rate stood at 96 percent in June increased to 155 percent in February 2012. Although the spread between the average maximum lending rate and the consolidated deposit rate narrowed by 23 basis points in February 2012, remain elevated at 1970 percent. This is as a result of tight liquidity conditions in the market, a consequence of the aggressive monetary tightening stance of the CBN, which started in 2011. In addition, other monetary aggregates (Broad (M2) money and Narrow money (M1)) are declining when compared to end 2011 data. Total 12 credit to the private sector declined by 797 percent on an annual basis and credit to the agricultural sector declined by 1125 percent. Further tightening now could increase lending cost to private sector and further constrain economic activities. Tight monetary policy stance has helped the country remain competitive in attracting foreign inflows. The tight monetary policy stance has been instrumental in attracting foreign exchange inflows and has helped to stabilize the foreign exchange market. As investors look for higher yield, the attractive interest rate in Nigeria has made the country an investment destination in a dry investment climate. Therefore maintaining the current stance will be helpful in sustaining the inflow. Weak growth in Europe is weighing down on global growth. Growth in advanced economies is projected to decelerate to 12 percent in 2012 from 16 percent recorded in 2011. While the US economy is showing signs of growth, as February labor report showed solid recovery and rapid job gain in the manufacturing sector with an average of 42, 000 jobs in January-February, against an average of 13,,000 in the last quarter of 2011, the story is different in Europe. Although some resolution of the Greece debt crisis is achieved, the ripple effect will linger for a while. In such an uncertain global environment, tightening will not be a good option for now. In the same view, easing monetary policy could reverse some of the important gains made in stabilizing the foreign exchange market. Based on the above. I will recommend a “no change” in monetary policy rate and Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR). The domestic economic growth challenges call for a stay of action on policy stance. 13 20 BARAU. SULEIMAN A today voted for the maintenance of status-quo, in policy (particularly to hold MPR at 12% within the 2% corridor and CRR at 8%). Review of Recent Developments B1 Inflation – Year-on-Year (YoY) Headline Inflation (HI) moderated to 119% in February compared to 125% in January with significant contributions from Transport. Alcoholic Beverages. Tobacco and Kola, and Health segments. YoY Food Inflation (FI) also moderated to 129% in February from 131% in January. YoY Core Inflation (CI) however increased to 135% in February from 127% in January with significant contribution from Clothing and Footwear. .2 Exchange Rate – we have since the last MPC witnessed the appreciation of the Naira in all segments of the market. In addition, the premium between the Wholesale Dutch Auction System (WDAS) and Bureau De Change (BDC) was reduced significantly to 151%. .3 Interest rates, particularly money market rates, have been volatile but remained largely within acceptable band. This volatility is largely driven by Governments‟ fiscal operations. .4 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) – the revised figures from National Bureau of Statistics showed GDP for 2011 at 736% compared to 798% in 2010. further review for the two years showed a consistent decline on quarter by quarter basis in 2010 compared to 2011. Agriculture Wholesale and Trade, and Services Sectors remained the major drivers. The relative contribution of the Agricultural Sector also shows a decline in 2011 compared to 2010. 14 B5 Foreign Reserves – We have recently seen a turn around on the level of our foreign reserves with reserve levels standing at US $3544 billion on March 15th, 2012 relative to US $3265 billion on December 31st 2011 or 859% increase. Comments C1 It is important to observe that the tight monetary regime that we have witnessed helped in containing the inflationary risk that we faced. Even though, this is the case, staff estimates for the next six months forecast increase in HI. CI and FI. In effect, the inflationary pressure is still a risk further down the line. .2 The Appropriation Act just passed by the National Assembly has been increased in size from N467 trillion to over N48 trillion. Considerable improvement has been witnessed in the structure of the budget in efforts to achieve consolidation. While revenues have been enhanced and expenditures streamlined, it is still a deficit budget and therefore expansionary. The risk here is that this may exacerbate the inflationary pressure, forecast for the economy. .3 A significant pressure point also stems from the decline in GDP growth rate in 2011. Though I have not seen any strong relationship between interest rate and output growth in Nigeria, the relatively high lending rate occasioned by our tightening stance may be partially accountable. This is in my view the key reason to elicit the easing of policy stance. The real issue however is that GDP growth can only be sustained if we have fundamental reforms that would ease doing business in Nigeria to address infrastructural and power challenges, amongst others. .4 Under the current policy stance, we have witnessed accretion to foreign reserves, stable and appreciating Naira, reduction in exchange rate premium and banking sector stability. .5 In view of the gains made under the current policy stance, threats of inflationary pressures down the line and the fact that growth issues are better addressed by fundamental reforms of the real sector. I am inclined to support the maintenance of status-quo. We should however keep the 15 usual window open for any significant unfavourable development to be addressed through an emergency Monetary Policy Committee meeting. Recommendation  Keep MPR at 12%  Maintain the corridor at plus and minus 2%  Keep Cash Reserve Ratio at 8%. .0 GARBA. ABDUL GANIYU Decision I vote for: 1. Holding the MPR at 12% 2. Maintaining the subsisting Corridor for SLF and SDF 3. Holding CRR at 8% Background At the January MPC. I voted to hold MPR at 12%; CRR at 8% and to maintain the symmetric corridor for SDF and SLF at to: 1. allow the menu of tightening policies of 2011 to work through the economic system; 2. provide investors policy stability as they plan their investment strategies for 2012 and beyond; and 3. incentivize the fiscal authorities to undertake the fiscal and associated fundamental reforms required to change the incentive system, begin to build the infrastructural system that will make the economy competitive in oil and gas, solid minerals, industry and agriculture so as to create the jobs needed to reverse the trend of unemployment. also expressed concern about: 16 1. The growing levels of unemployment from 123% in 2006 to 239% in 2011 even when GDP growth averaged 68% in the period. The persistent hemorrhaging of investible capital through rising net outflows to pay for foreign services and net payments of investment incomes. As a result, the economy on aggregate under invests and under consumes to pay for foreign services and to pay foreign investors in flows that significantly exceed inflows of portfolio and FDI investments. The structural and competitiveness failures linked to the composition of output and exports that are dominated by primary products and the misalignment of Nigeria‟s aggregate demand to its aggregate supply. The size of the fiscal deficit and public debt and its crowding-out effects on credit to the private/real sectors of the economy. The persistence of the episodic “FAAC effect” which unsettles the money market causing the MPC operating targets (obb and interbank rates) to exhibit FAAC related volatilities. The poor performance of the capital market exemplified by a loss of N22 Trillion Naira in 2011 with Banking Stocks the worse hit. Developments in the Economy Since the January 2012 MPC Meeting: 1. Recent sets of data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicate: i. An unexpected decline in month of month headline inflation from 335% in January to 028% in February that suggests among other things that the real budget effects of the PMS Price shock in January may have counteracted the aggregate supply effects. significant rise in the incidence of poverty from 544% in 2004 to 69% in 2010 indicating that 11247 million Nigerians were living under $1 a day in 2010. In addition, the NBS projected arise to 71% in 2011 and growth in income inequalities (class, state and regional). These data reinforce a view that the budget effects of the PMS Price shock moderated the inflationary effects but, most likely at the cost of forgone living standards of more than 69% of Nigerians. The GDP slowed in 2011 (738%) relative 2010(798%) with the contributions of agriculture and manufacturing also significantly lower in 2011 relative to 2010. slowing down of growth does not 17 augur well for job creation and a reduction in unemployment which was already almost a quarter of the workforce. The key monetary aggregates (M1. Demand Deposit. Savings Deposit. Time Deposit. M2. Net Domestic Credit and Credit to the Private Sector) all contracted significantly in February continuing a trend from January for most. The operating targets (obb and call rates) were volatile around the target rates of 14% with the usual “FAAC Effect” a strong causal force. The prime (1692%) and maximum (2332%) lending rates remained high interest while the savings deposit rate remained very low at 143%. As a result, the interest rate spread remained very wide: averaging 628% between maximum and prime and, between 175% and 211% for maximum relative to savings deposit rate. The structure of banking system loan portfolio remains highly concentrated and biased against agriculture and other real activity and significant exposure to FGN Bonds and Treasury Bills. The forex market was relatively stable as demand slowed significantly most likely, a fallout of the public hearings on subsidy programme by the National Assembly. The decline in demand has the beneficial effects of stabilizing the exchange rate also, enabling a buildup of external reserves. The capital market continued its downward trend in 2012 with a loss of 045% and 06% in the All Share Index and Market Capitalization respectively by March 16, 2012 relative to December 2011. The data on Federal Fiscal operations indicated a sharp fall in revenue (483%) and expenditure (76%) generating a surplus of N10676 in January. Though “unusual circumstances” including the “subsidy strike‟ may explain the fiscal performance in January. It does show that the scope for expenditure reduction and, for a more efficient deployment of national revenue is significant. Finally, the data on the external account indicates a continuing of the hemorrhaging of investment capital in the form of net outflows on services and investment income in the fourth quarter of 2011 to the tune of 1638 Trillion compared to net inflows of portfolio and FDI of 4156 billion Naira. In 2011, the sum of the net outflow on the services and investment income accounts was 637 Trillion. Just a 10% decline in the outflow (637 billion) would have built at least four $1billion cement plants! 18 Deciding Issues 1. gave greater weights to the domestic developments and, evidence on the asymmetrical nature of rate cuts and rate increases in reaching my decision to hold. The data indicating slowdown in GDP, rising unemployment, declining and concentrated structure of credit to the private sector, under- performance of the Capital market and, poverty on the one hand and, the goals of the 2012 Federal Budget (fiscal consolidation, inclusive growth and job) on the other, make a powerful case for easing. The deciding argument against a rate cut at this point are: a. unless fiscal responsibility measures become effective, reduce government spending, deficit and public debt particularly, treasury bonds and treasury bills significantly, deposit money banks will have no incentive to lend to the real economy when rates are cut; hence, b. the pass through effects of rate cuts will neither be instantaneous nor significant to achieve desired reallocation in net domestic credit to real activity (agriculture, manufacturing, exports and public utilities) which accounted for only 178% of total credit to the private sector. Holding gives the fiscal authorities the opportunity to accelerate the process of full compliance with FRA 2007 and to enhance the productivity of government spending, reduce spending, deficit, borrowing and the public debt. It also gives the fiscal authorities an incentive to accelerate what they call fiscal consolidation because it (fiscal consolidation if it means more efficient allocation, reduction in wasteful expenditure, deficit and public debt) is; a precondition for inclusive growth and job creation. This is because the evidence is very strong that government debt crowds out the type of private investment that adds values, creates jobs and includes more people in the growth or value creating processes. It is also important to begin to wind down the entrenched system of financial subsidy through appropriate administrative actions. The argument for sustaining the January 2012 trend of fiscal operations throughout 2012 through a greater compliance with the fiscal rules in the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007 including that on Borrowing is very compelling. This is because at 65 Trillion Naira, the total Federal Debt is already 03 Trillion Naira higher than the pre-Paris Club level in 2004 and 41 Trillion Naira above the post-Paris Club level in 2006 suggesting that in 19 just five year, the total debt had tripled! The idea that the debt to GDP ratio is below some arbitrary threshold is a very bad and unwise idea. Two of the key principles in economics are (a) the trade-off principle and (b) that rational decisions are made on the margin. At 19% of total revenue in 2011, the debt service to revenue ratio is already too high in terms of the opportunity costs (forgone infrastructures and, education and health capacities and so on). Rationally or wisely thinking at the margin requires a case by case economic evaluation of borrowing plans as provided for in the FRA 2007. The idea that government debt should be used to deepen the bond market is also, a very bad and a most unwise decision especially in the context of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. Holding also gives the forward looking monetary policies of 2011 time to work through the economic system. This is necessary particularly, because the factors that caused headline inflation to ease in February and, forex demand to ease in January and February such as the contraction in spending and in monetary aggregates may not be sustained in the second quarter. Finally, holding reinforces the commitment to price and exchange rate stability and, to a stable policy environment for more effective business planning in 2012. .0 LEMO. TUNDE Macroeconomic outcomes have been mixed between January and March 14, 2012 (Review period). Headline inflation, which moderated to 103 per cent at end-December 2011 from 1180 per cent at the comparable period of 2010, increased to 126 per cent in January 2012, before moderating to 119 per cent at end-February 2012. Projections indicate that it would still continue in the upward direction in the next couple of months in response to the partial removal of subsidy on PMS and some other upside risks, including seasonal factors. On the positive side, however, estimated growth in output at 768 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011 could be a"
Thailand,2012-03-21,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 21 March 2012 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announces the outcome of the meeting today as follows. The MPC assessed that the global economy continued to grow at a slow pace but with lower downside risk relative to the previous meeting. The US economic outlook became more positive in light of sustained improvements in the labor market and private sector confidence. At the same time, risks to financial stability in the euro zone declined following the significant progress in debt restructuring for Greece. Long-term liquidity measures provided by the European Central Bank also helped shore up market confidence. Economic growth in Asia moderated slightly but the outlook improved as exports picked up from the recent lull and domestic demand continued to be supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies. Upside risk to inflation increased as tensions in the Middle East led to a sharp rise in the price of oil. The economic recovery in Thailand gained traction. Latest indicators pointed towards improvements in all key areas of the economy and manufacturing production remained on track to return to normal levels by the third quarter of this year. Domestic demand continued to be the main driving force for the economy supported by improvements in income, employment and private sector confidence, as well as government stimulus measures and accommodative monetary conditions. Meanwhile exports should gradually pick up in tandem with the recovery in manufacturing production and greater stability of the global economy. Inflationary pressure remained stable in the short-run, though upside risks persisted from rising global oil prices and the minimum wage increase. pick-up in private demand and government spending could exert additional upward pressure on inflation, especially in the latter half of this year when the Thai economy moves closer to potential. The MPC assessed that the risks from the global economy had decreased and that the recovery in the Thai economy was gaining momentum. At the same time, inflationary pressure had edged up. In this context, the MPC deemed the current level of the policy rate to be appropriate in supporting economic recovery while still consistent with keeping inflation within target. The MPC, therefore, voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 300 percent per annum at this meeting."
Egypt,2012-03-22,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release March 22, 2012 In its meeting held on March 22, 2012, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 925 percent 1025 percent, respectively, and the 7‐day repo at 975 percen. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 95 percen. Headline CPI increased by 067 percent (m/m) in February following the 015 percent inch up in January, bringing the annual rate to 919 percent from 860 percent recorded in the previous mont. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 052 percent in February following the 055 percent increase in January while the annual rate inched up to 730 percent in February from 686 percent in the previous mont. The bulk of the latest monthly developments continued to be driven by food price movements while non‐food prices remained broadly tam. While the probability of a rebound in international food prices is less likely now in light of recent global developments, the repercussions of the outbreak of the foot and mouth disease along with the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels pose upside risks to the inflation outloo. Meanwhile real GDP grew by a mere 03 percent in 2011/2012 Q1 a(cid::332)er a similarly feeble growth of 04 percent in 2010/2011 Q4, following the significant contraction of 43 percent recorded in 2010/2011 Q3 due to the poli(cid::415)cal events in Egypt and the regio. This mainly came on the back of continued weakening in the tourism, manufacturing, and construction sector. In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants over the past year, investment levels con(cid::415)nued to deteriorate recording an annual retrenchment of 114 percent in 2011/2012 Q1. Looking ahead, the current poli(cid::415)cal transforma(cid::415)on may con(cid::415)nue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Are. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. Given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks and the uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter.

Israel,2012-03-26,"26.03.2012 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for April 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was unchanged in February, slightly below the average forecast, which was for an increase of 0.1 percent. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the CPI increased 0.3 percent,above the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target. The rate of inflation over the past 12 months was 1.7 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The average of forecasters' inflation predictions for the next twelve CPI readings continued to increase, and is currently 2.5 percent, compared with 2.3 percent last month. Inflation expectations for the next 12 CPI readings, based on CPI futures contracts offered over-the-counter by banks, were 2.5 percent on average this month, compared with 2 percent last month. The increase in expectations apparently derives from supply side factors, primarily worldwide energy prices. One year forward inflation expectations as calculated from the capital markets (break-even inflation) were 2.9 percent on average in March, a 0.3 percentage point increase from the previous month. With that, this series is affected by seasonal factors, due to a lack of continuous indexed bond series. Thus, the expectations estimate is apparently biased upward this month as well. Inflation expectations for the medium term were stable at 2.6 percent, and for longer terms declined by about 0.2 percentage points to 2.4 percent. Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now,based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, reflect expectations of an increase in the Bank of Israel interest rate to 2.7 percent, and expectations calculated from the makam yield curve were 2.6 percent. The average of forecasters' predictions of the interest rate in one year's time was 2.6 percent, compared with average projections of 2.4 percent lastmonth. Forecasters project that the Bank of Israel interest rate will remain unchanged for the next three months. Real economic activity: Economic indicators that became availablethis month support the assessment that the pace of growth is stabilizing at the level recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011, and concern of a further decline in the rate of GDP growth has eased. The Composite State of the Economy Indices for January and February indicated stability at a level of growth similar to that recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011. The components of the composite index which contributed to the rise in the index were manufacturing production, goods imports, and services exports. These were partially offset by declines in goods exports and the trade and services revenue index. The Central Bureau of Statistics monthly survey of business trends also indicates that the slowdown in the rate of growth is ending, with potential for some acceleration in growth in the coming months. The Research Department's index based on Google searches, which serves as an indicator of demand in the economy in the coming months, is positive, although it doesnot forecast significant acceleration in growth. The Purchasing Managers Index increased in February to 44 points, after a sharp drop in the previousmonth, with a positive change in most of its components. This level is still below 50, however, the level considered the boundary between contractionand expansion of activity. The labor market: In the labor market a high level of employment and a low unemployment rate persists. The Labor Force Survey for the fourthquarter indicates a low unemployment rate of 5.4 percent, with stability in the participation rate. Despite the favorable unemployment figures, some slowdown can be seen in the labor market: the rate of increase in the number of employee posts has been on a downward trend since the second quarter of 2011. In December 2011, the rate of increase in employee posts, on an annual basis, was below 1.5 percent, compared with more than 4 percent in the beginning of 2011. The Central Bureau of Statistics Job Vacancy Survey indicates some decline in the number of job vacancies in February. Nominal wages increased 1 percent in October-December, compared with the preceding three months, and real wages increased 0.6 percent. Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of total wage payments, were 5 percent higherin February in nominal terms than in February 2011 (excluding the effect of legislative changes). The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: The Bank of Israel Research Department compiled its quarterly staff forecast this month. Projected GDP growth in 2012 was revised slightly upward, to 3.1 percent, and the forecast for 2013 is 3.5 percent. The Research Department forecasts an increase in the unemployment rate to 5.9 percent at the end of 2012. The new forecast projects an inflation rate of 2.6 percent over the next four quarters and an average interest rate in the first quarter of 2013 of 2.5 percent. The Research Department noted that the main risks to the forecast are a deterioration in the geopolitical situation and increases in energy prices, which would increase inflation and slow activity, and a worseningof the debt crisis in Europe, which would reduce inflation and also slow activity. Budget data: Total tax receipts in the first two months of the year were NIS 1.3 billion above the seasonal path consistent with the tax revenues forecast in the budget, which the Ministry of Finance updated at the beginning of the year, and which is consistent with a deficit of 3.4 percent of GDP. The better-than-forecast receipts were due mainly to an exceptional one-time revenue in January. Net of that revenue, tax receipts are in line with the revised forecast. Trend figures (at constant prices, net of seasonal factors) indicate that direct tax receipts in February were essentially unchanged compared with the preceding month. The government's budget surplus since the beginning of the year reached NIS 3.3 billion, and net of the one-time revenues it is approximately in line with the revised deficit forecast. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on February 26, 2012, through March 23, 2012, the shekel appreciated against the dollar by about 0.9 percent, while other major currencies depreciated against the dollar by up to 3.25 percent. Against the euro, the shekel appreciated about 2.4 percent, while in trade against other currencies the euro moved in opposite directions. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel appreciated by about 1.3 percent. The strengthening of the shekel this month followed a trend of depreciation evident in the last few months. The capital and money markets: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on February 26, 2012, through March 23, 2012, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by 4 percent, against the background of the announcementby the Supervisor of Banks about increases in the capital ratios of the banks, to be implemented in the years ahead. The increases were less than expected by the banks and by the market. Following the announcement the bank shares index rose by 8 percent. The rise in the Tel Aviv 25 index may be seen against the background of the mixed trends evident in the leading share indices around the world, in comparison with which the Tel Aviv indices have been under-performing in the last few months. Yields increased in the government bond market, particularly in the unindexed segment, but also in theCPI-indexed segment along the entire yield curves. The yield differential between Israeli 10-year government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasurysecurities contracted by 21 basis points (b.p.) to 246 b.p., from 267 b.p.just before the previous monetary discussion; this was due to a sharper rise in yields in the US. Makam yields increased during the period along the entire curve to an average of 2.6 percent, so that the market essentially does not project an interest rate reduction in the coming year. Nonresident investors continued to exit from this channel, thus supporting the increasein yields. The trend of money market fund withdrawals continued this monthas well, while corporate bond mutual funds attracted net new investments again this month, albeit at low levels. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread widened slightly to 195 b.p., compared with 190 b.p. just before the previous interest rate decision. The Tel-Bond 20 and the Tel-Bond 40 Index increased by 0.5 percent. Tel-Bond yield gapsvis-?-vis government bonds narrowed this month, while those of holding company bonds remained around their high levels of a month ago. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in February, the M 1monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increasedby 0.7 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 9.1 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The balance of outstanding debt of the business sector declined in January by 0.2 percent, to NIS 771 billion. The decline in the debt balance derived primarily from the appreciation of the shekel against the dollar, which reduced the shekel value of foreign currency debt. Outstanding credit to households increased by 0.1 percent, to NIS 365 billion. The balance of outstanding housing credit to households increased by 0.2 percent in January, to NIS 259 billion. Total mortgages granted in the twelve months ending in February was 2.3 percent lower than that advanced in the twelve months to January, continuing the decline from the peak level in May. Unindexed floating rate mortgages granted in February constituted 27.3 percent of total new mortgages. Interest rates on floating rate price-indexed and unindexed mortgages declined, while interest rates on fixed rate CPI-indexed mortgages were unchanged. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (representing rents), was unchanged in February. In the twelve months to February it increased by 4.6 percent. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased in December-January by 0.1 percent, the second consecutive increaseafter three months in which the cumulative decline was 1.4 percent. In thetwelve months to January, home prices increased by 4.5 percent, continuingthe marked slowdown from the rates recorded in previous months. Activity in the construction industry continues to be strong. There were 43,648 building starts in the twelve months to November, compared with 43,537 in the twelve months to October, and the number of completions was 33,917 compared with the previous month's figure of 34,775. However, in the fourth quarter of 2011 there was some decline in building starts, and it reached about 40,000 units per year. The sharp increase in building starts that began at the end of 2009 has led to an increase in the number of homes for sale, and in recent months it reached the levels of 2003-07. The moderation in the rate of increase in home prices in recent months comes against the background of the continued increase in the number of building starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken bythe Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation. These moves, together with land marketing efforts by the Ministry of Construction and Housing and the Israel Land Administration, are expected to continue to have an effect in the future. The global economy: US macroeconomic data generally continued to surprise on the upside, and appear even better compared with the eurozone economy. The US economy grew by 3 percent in the fourth quarter, the highestrate of increase since the second quarter of 2010, compared with a contraction of 0.3 percent in the eurozone. Employment figures, consumer confidence, retail sales, and production data in the US all indicate expansion. Investment house assessments are that the treaty for tightening fiscal discipline in Europe is expected to make the switch to future growth in Europe moredifficult. Macroeconomic data in emerging markets are mixed, but continue to indicate a slowdown in their growth, with India and Brazil each reporting that their growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2011 was the lowest in two years, and China reduced its growth forecasts to 7.5 percent. The rate ofinflation in the US and the eurozone was unchanged in February, and over the previous 12 months inflation was 2.9 percent in the US and 2.7 percent in the eurozone. With that, there are concerns of an increase in energy prices, which will increase inflation rates, a situation reflected in recent months by an increase in inflation expectations in the US and Germany. The Fed and ECB left their interest rates unchanged this month. The Fed announcedthat it intends to maintain its funds rate at its near-zero level at leastuntil the end of 2014, although the market is pricing in an interest rate increase as early as in August 2013. The ECB adopted another monetary expansion plan, which includes injecting significant liquidity into banks in theeurozone. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate for April 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent is consistent with an interest rate policy that is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel, the global economy, monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following were the main considerations underlying the decision: The CPI was unchanged in February. Inflation over the previous 12 months continues tosettle firmly within the inflation target range, and is currently at 1.7 percent. Inflation expectations from various sources (forecasters, the Bank of Israel. CPI futures) for the next twelve months are within the inflationtarget range. However, in the past two months they have increased, and arecurrently in a range of 2.4-2.6 percent, mainly due to the increase in energy prices world wide, and the possibility of further increases in the months ahead. The indicators that became available this month indicate a stable rate of increase of activity at the levels recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011. Estimated expectations of economic activity have improved, and they indicate some improvement in the rate of growth. Against this background, the Research Department updated its forecasts for growth in 2012 to 3.1 percent, compared with its forecast published 3 months ago which projected 2.8 percent. The forecast for 2013 is for growth of 3.5 percent. Developments in the global economy and the international capital markets this month reduced the probability of significant deterioration in economic activity in Europe and the US in the near future. Most US macroeconomic data surprised on the upside, and the US economy grew by 3 percent in the fourth quarter. In contrast, in the eurozone there was contraction of 0.3 percent. Macro data in emerging countries were mixed, but continue to indicate a moderate slowdown in their growth. Interest rates in major economies remained low, and markets are not pricing in an increase in the interest rate this year by any of the central banks of large advanced economies. The Fed and ECB, maintained their interest rates unchanged this month, as expected. The Fed declared that it intends to maintain the federal funds rate at its near-zero level at least until the end of 2014. The ECB launched an additional monetary expansion program which includes injecting significant liquidity into eurozone banks. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in financial markets. The Bank will use thetools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the asset markets. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on April 9, 2012. The decision regarding the interest rate for May 2012 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. April 23, 2012. 26.03.2012 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for April 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent. The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for April 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent.

Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was unchanged in February, slightly below the average forecast, which was for an increase of 0.1 percent. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to leave the interest rate for April 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent is consistent with an interest rate policy that is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability.

Hungary,2012-03-27,"At its meeting on 27 March, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 7.00%.The Council also reviewed the March issue of the MNB's Quarterly Report on Inflation prepared by Bank staff. In the Council's judgement, the Hungarian economy is likely to stagnate this year, with growth expected to resume in 2013. The level of output will remain below its potential over the entire period. The consumer price index is expected to rise significantly, reflecting the effects of increases in VAT and excise duties as well as the rise in oil prices and the depreciation of the forint exchange rate in the second half of 2011. In the longer term, however, the path of consumer prices is likely to be dominated by the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand. Consumer prices rose more sharply in the first few months of the year than projected in the December Report. In part, that may have reflected the rapid pass-through of increases in indirect taxes and higher underlying inflation. Despite weak domestic demand, firms with declining profitability may be able to pass on some of the increase in their costs due to the weaker exchange rate and rising commodity prices, as suggested by the rises in tax-adjusted core inflation in JanuaryFebruary. In the Council's judgement, however, the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand is likely to be a key determinant of consumer prices as the effects of the indirect tax increases and the depreciation of the exchange rate wane. Nevertheless, special attention should be given to the inflationary effects of rising oil prices. The slowdown in global growth and the euro-area debt crisis point to a weaker outlook for activity in Hungary's export markets. Moreover, balance sheet adjustment by the European banking sector continues. In the current global environment, export growth is likely to weaken and tight credit conditions to remain. However. Hungary's export markets and the rate of export growth may recover gradually from mid-2012. Domestic demand is expected to decline further. The uncertain global and domestic economic environment and the tightening in credit conditions will restrain investment growth. Household consumption is likely to remain low, due to the uncertain prospects for income growth and tight fiscal policy. However. Government measures aimed to ensure that the deficit target is met are required for perceptions about the Hungarian economy to improve. Labour market conditions are expected to be loose over the period ahead, as the increase in activity is likely to be associated with subdued demand for labour. Perceptions about the Hungarian economy have changed little in the past month, despite the increase in global risk appetite. Global financial markets have been highly volatile over the past six months. The Monetary Council therefore continues to consider it important that an agreement between the Government, the EU and IMF is reached as soon as possible, in order to reduce the risks associated with financing the government debt. The Council noted the important structural measures taken by the Government to reduce the budget deficit. The Monetary Council has decided to leave the base rate unchanged. Monetary policy can best contribute to economic growth by maintaining a predictable economic environment, ensuring price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system. High volatility of risk perceptions and underlying inflation continue to warrant a cautious policy stance."
Turkiye,2012-03-27,"Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand continues as envisaged. While consumption demand shows a significant slowdown in the first quarter, leading indicators suggest a modest recovery for the second quarter. Exports continue to grow at a steady pace. Accordingly, despite the elevated oil prices, the improvement in the current account balance is expected to continue in the forthcoming period. Inflation developments are in line with the path projected in the January Inflation Report. Yet, the Central Bank has implemented a new round of additional monetary tightening in order to eliminate the impact of recent cost developments on inflation expectations. Factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored in the forthcoming period and additional monetary tightening will be repeated, when necessary. Taking the liquidity projections into account, the ranges for weekly and monthly Turkish lira funding have been revised. In addition, certain revisions regarding the fraction of required reserves that can be held in gold have been approved. Given the prevailing uncertainties regarding the global economy, it would be appropriate to preserve the flexibility of the monetary policy. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Georgia,2012-03-28,"28.03.2012 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate Unchanged at 6.5 percent The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on March 28, 2012 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 6.5 percent. The inflation forecast hasn't changed from the previous months. According to existing forecasts inflation will remain low in the first half of the year. Starting in June the inflation will start growing and it is expected to reach its target value by the beginning of the next year. The annual price change in February equaled -2.1%, the negative value of inflation mostly due to the base effect. The core inflation (net of food and energy prices) has been mostly stable for last couple years and equals to 1.9% in February. The Georgian economy grew by 7% in 2011, which is higher than expected. Despite high growth rates the output gap is equal to zero, which indicates to the absence of inflationary pressures from the demand side. Recently there has been a declining trend in the money market interest rates, mainly caused by the excess liquidity accumulated in the banking system. Low interest rates will stimulate the bank credit growth and overall growth in economic activity. In the recent months the real exchange rate appreciation tendency, which began in last August, has stopped. Keeping the real effective exchange rate from excessive appreciation is important for the growth in country's competitiveness. Interest rates on the money market are stable and lower than the monetary policy rate, which effectively means the monetary easing. Taking this into account the Monetary Policy Committee ruled against further policy easing on this stage and decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on April 25, 2012."
Czech Republic,2012-03-29,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 2nd Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 29 March 2012 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided by a majority vote to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.75%. Six members voted in favour of this decision, and one member voted for increasing rates by 0.25 percentage point. Reasons for the decision According to the current forecast, monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the target over the entire forecast horizon. In line with the forecast, headline inflation will rise temporarily to just above 3% in 2012 owing to a VAT increase, but will fall back below the target at the start of 2013. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates in the near future and a modest decline thereafter. In line with the forecast, the y-o-y growth was driven solely by net exports. The January industrial production figures (annual growth of 0.6%, a m-o-m decline of 0.6 %, s.a.) indicate continuing stagnation of economic activity. The ILO unemployment rate slightly declined in q-o-q terms (to 6.6%, s.a.). The seasonally adjusted registered unemployment rate increased negligibly in January and February 2012. Y-o-y average nominal wage growth in the business sector decelerated in 2011 Q4 (to 2.1%), while it accelerated in the public sector (to 1.6%). Y-o-y growth in industrial producer prices slowed in February, whereas agricultural producer prices declined y-o-y.

Romania,2012-03-29,"The NBR will continue to closely monitor domestic and global economic developments in order to, by accordingly adjusting its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving price stability, as well as financial stability. The annual inflation rate continued to slide, reaching 2.6 percent in February 2012 versus 3.14 percent in December 2011. The annual adjusted CORE 21 inflation rate also dropped to 2.05 percent from 2.37 percent in December 2011. The fall in the annual inflation rate to a record low is the result of the implementation of the economic and financial programme agreed under the external financing arrangements with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions. Against the background of keeping adequate real broad monetary conditions, the fading-out of the VAT hike impact and the relatively favourable development in food prices have contributed to a rapid slowdown in inflation. In this context, the central bank in the autumn of 2011 started a rate-cut and adequate liquidity management cycle, its moves rapidly feeding through into interbank money market rates which fell below the policy rate. Improved money market conditions triggered a steadily downward trend of government securities yields on the primary market, while the secondary market also became more active, with a favourable impact on the redistribution of liquidity in the banking sector. Nevertheless, tensions and uncertainties related to the euro area sovereign debt crisis have also affected Romania's banking sector as credit institutions have mutually contained exposures. This had a negative effect on the distribution of liquidity across the banking sector and on the money market, demanding a heightened fine-tuning role of the central bank, in line with European and global trends. These developments, along with the specific loan-to-deposit ratios and the deleveraging process undertaken by some credit institutions, in line with trends at the European level, result in a slower recovery of non-government lending. Heightened activity in the secondary market for government securities, along with revived confidence of investors and market operators, will thus help alleviate the uneven distribution of liquidity, ensuring a better resource allocation. Statistical data for February 2012 regarding interest rates on loans to the private sector are expected to reveal an ongoing transmission of the monetary signal, especially in the area of corporate lending where the dynamics of new leu-denominated credits are close to those of new foreign currency loans. The inflation outlook reconfirms a slowdown in both headline and core inflation in the forthcoming period. Developments in macroeconomic indicators show a persistent negative output gap amid the moderating annual growth of industrial output and exports as well as given the increased uncertainties related to the European economic growth outlook. The statistical base effects will trigger a temporary rise in the annual inflation rate in the second half of 2012 without overshooting the variation band around the 3 percent target. These perspectives confirm the need to maintain adequate real broad monetary conditions in line with the anticipated movements in the annual inflation rate throughout the projection horizon. In this context, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 5.25 percent per annum from 5.50 percent per annum. Thus, starting March 30, 2012, the annual interest rate on the deposit facility will be cut to 1.25 percent from 1.50 percent, while the overnight (Lombard) rate will be 9.25 percent per annum versus 9.50 percent previously. The NBR Board has also decided to further pursue an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and keep unchanged the minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The consolidation of inflation within the variation band around the target paves the way for maintaining financial stability and achieving sustainable economic growth. However, domestic risks related to upcoming elections, along with uncertainties regarding developments in the external environment, capital flows and volatile prices require a further judicious adjustment of monetary policy instruments in order to effectively anchor inflation expectations and ensure price stability in the medium run. The NBR restates that achieving both price and financial stability, in the context of fulfilling the commitments under the external financing arrangements with the EU, the IMF and other international financial institutions, is essential for ensuring lasting economic growth. Increased absorption of European funds along with a gradual revival of domestic demand will secure a sustainable economic recovery. The NBR reiterates that it will continue to closely monitor domestic and global economic developments in order to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives to achieve price stability, as well as financial stability by adjusting its available instruments accordingly. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for May 2, 2012, when the new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1 Calculated by the NBR by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index.

South Africa,2012-03-29,"Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) the intensity of the financial crisis in the Eurozone appears to have subsided somewhat, but the very mixed signals indicate that the crisis is not necessarily resolved. Despite the positive indications, the global outlook remains fragile amid doubts about the strength of the US recovery, a recession in Europe, the extent of a slowdown in China and higher international oil prices. Domestic economic growth remains constrained, but the improved performance of the economy in the fourth quarter of 2011, and some positive developments in the global economy indicate a slightly better outlook than previously expected. The most recent inflation outcome surprised on the downside, and there has been a slight downward revision to the inflation forecast while inflation expectations continue to be anchored around the upper end of the inflation target band. Inflation appears to be somewhat more broad-based but in line with our previous forecasts, and the risks to the outlook remain evenly balanced. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 6,1 per cent in February, down from 6,3 per cent in January. This favourable outcome was primarily the result of a moderation in food price inflation, from 10,7 per cent to 10,1 per cent. The categories of food, housing and utilities, and transport together accounted for 4,2 percentage points of the inflation outcome. CPI inflation excluding food, petrol and electricity increased from 3,9 per cent in December to 4,3 per cent in January and was unchanged in February. Year-on-year producer price inflation has continued its moderating trend, measuring 8,9 per cent and 8,3 per cent in January and February 2012 respectively. Agricultural price inflation declined from 7,9 per cent in January to 4,6 per cent in February, while manufactured food price inflation remained unchanged at 10,9 per cent. The inflation forecast of the Bank is marginally lower than at the time of the previous meeting of the MPC. Inflation is still expected to peak in the second quarter of 2012 but at a slightly lower rate of 6,5 per cent and to average 6,1 per cent in the final quarter of 2012 and 5,6 per cent in the subsequent quarter. Inflation is expected to measure 5,2 per cent by the end of the forecast period at the end of 2013. The slightly improved inflation trajectory is mainly a result of a less depreciated exchange rate assumption. Following the change in the electricity tariffs by Nersa, the electricity price assumption has been reduced from 17,3 per cent to 12,0 per cent. Given the low weight of electricity in the CPI basket, the impact on the forecast was marginal. The forecast for core inflation, as measured by headline inflation excluding food, electricity and petrol, continues to show an upward trend, reflecting possibly more broad-based inflation pressures as well as base effects. This measure is expected to peak at an average of 5,4 per cent in the final quarter of 2012, which is marginally lower than in the previous forecast. Inflation expectations, as reflected in the Survey of Inflation Expectations conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at Stellenbosch University during the first quarter of 2012, appear to have remained relatively anchored around the upper end of the inflation target range. Respondents expect inflation to average 6,1 per cent in both 2012 and 2013, and 6,0 per cent in 2014. Compared with the previous survey, the forecast for 2012 is unchanged, while that for 2013 is up by 0,1 percentage point. Business executives are the most pessimistic, with expectations of 6,5 per cent for both 2013 and 2014. The expectations of financial analysts are marginally higher than those reflected in the latest Reuters survey of market analysts which shows expected inflation to average 6,2 per cent in 2012 and 5,7 per cent in the following two years. The immediate threat to the global economy posed by the European sovereign debt crisis appears to have subsided somewhat, but significant risks remain. Market signals in respect of what progress is being made with the resolution of the crisis are mixed, but spreads on sovereign debt of the affected European economies have narrowed significantly, partly as a result of the Greek debt swap, as well as liquidity provision by the ECB which has been directed in part to increased purchases of sovereign debt by banks. Despite these positive developments, the Eurozone economy is still expected to experience a recession this year in the face of widespread fiscal austerity and tight bank lending conditions. Continued deleveraging by banks is a considerable risk given potential spill-over effects. The US economy shows signs of improvement but the economy still has a negative output gap, and there are some doubts about the sustainability of this growth performance. The Chinese economy has shown signs of slowing, but a hard landing is not generally expected. Emerging market growth generally is also more subdued, and the policy tightening that had been a feature of many of these economies earlier in 2011 has either stopped or been reversed. Global inflation appears to be broadly contained amid slowing growth and declining food price trends. However international oil price developments, driven mainly by geopolitical factors, are posing an increasing risk not only to inflation, but also to the growth outlook. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has appreciated in line with declining risk aversion in global financial markets. The volatility of the rand has also moderated, with the rand fluctuating in a range of between R7,45 and R7,78 to the US dollar since the beginning of February. Since the beginning of the year, the rand has appreciated by 5,0 per cent against the US dollar, by 2,3 per cent against the euro, and by 4,8 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The Reuters poll in February reflects an expectation that the rand will continue to trade at around current levels for the rest of the year. However, the currency is expected to remain sensitive to changes in global investor sentiment. The pattern of portfolio flows to South Africa has persisted, with non-residents being net buyers of bonds and net sellers of equities despite a resumption of net flows into emerging equity markets in general. Since the beginning of the year, non-residents net purchases of bonds have totaled R17,5 billion, while net sales of equities have totaled R6,0 billion. The domestic economic outlook appears slightly more favourable against the backdrop of a more positive global outlook. In 2011 an annual real growth rate of 3,1 per cent was recorded, following a fourth quarter growth rate of 3,2 per cent. The latter was driven mainly by positive contributions from the manufacturing and mining sectors, partly reflecting some normalisation following the impact on the third quarter growth performance of industrial action and other disruptions. The Bank's GDP growth forecast has been revised marginally upwards to 3,0 per cent in 2012, compared with 2,8 per cent in the previous forecast, mainly as a result of a slightly more favourable global outlook, which remains uncertain. The growth forecast for 2013 has increased from 3,8 per cent to 3,9 per cent. This moderately improved outlook is consistent with the increase in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index in the first quarter of 2012 to above the neutral level of 50, as well as the positive trend observed in the South African Reserve Bank's composite leading indicator. Nevertheless the expected growth rates remains disappointing and still imply a persistence of the negative output gap. Notwithstanding the improved forecast, the outlook for the mining sector continues to disappoint with an annualised growth rate of 0,7 per cent in the final quarter of last year. In January 2012, mining output contracted at a month-on-month rate of 4,6 per cent, and output in February is expected to have been negatively impacted by industrial action, maintenance shut-downs and electricity supply constraints. More positively, the recovery in the manufacturing sector is expected to continue. The physical volume of manufacturing output increased by 1,2 per cent on a month-on-month basis in January, while the Kagiso/BER Purchasing Managers Index increased significantly from 53,2 index points in January to 57,9 index points in February, its highest level since February 2010. Nevertheless the sector is still characterised by excess capacity which is likely to constrain investment in this sector. Trends in gross fixed capital formation are also encouraging, with an annualised growth rate of 7,2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011, and 4,4 per cent for the year. Nevertheless the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to GDP at 18,9 per cent, is still significantly below the peak of 24,6 per cent reached in the final quarter of 2008. The renewed focus by government on infrastructure expenditure and successful implementation should underpin fixed capital formation, and also give a boost to the domestic construction sector which remains under pressure. There are concerns, however, that continued underspending on infrastructure by provincial and local governments, as well as possible electricity supply constraints, could retard these developments. Formal sector employment growth was relatively low in the fourth quarter of 2011. According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics (QES) of Statistics South Africa, formal sector employment grew at a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0,3 per cent but on a seasonally adjusted basis the growth was in fact slightly negative, and by 1,6 per cent over four quarters, amounting to 130,000 employees. Formal sector employment will have to grow by a further 131,000 to reach the levels achieved in 2008 before the crisis. Household consumption expenditure remained robust in the final quarter of 2011 when it grew at an annualised rate of 4,6 per cent, compared with 3,8 per cent in the previous quarter, and by 5,0 per cent for the year. This category was the largest contributor to GDP growth in 2011. The increased pace of spending, particularly on durable goods, was consistent with a further increase in disposable income of households, positive wealth effects and a low interest rate environment. At these growth rates, consumption is not expected to pose a significant risk to inflation, and there are some indications that consumption expenditure growth may have peaked following the 0,6 per cent contraction in retail sales growth in January and a moderation in new vehicle sales growth in February. The FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index also remained unchanged at a relatively neutral level in the first quarter of 2012. There has been a gradual increase in the growth of credit extension in recent months, reflecting in part the increase in consumption expenditure. Having fluctuated around 6 per cent for much of 2011, twelve-month growth in total loans and advances to the private sector increased to 7,4 per cent in December 2011 and 7,3 per cent in January 2012. Growth in mortgage advances has remained subdued at 2,4 per cent in January, with the main driver coming from the category of “other loans and advances”. All the components of this category showed strong twelve-month growth in January: credit card advances increased by 11,1 per cent (a three-and-a-half year high); bank overdrafts by 14,5 per cent, having experienced negative growth between January 2009 and March 2011; and general loans which moderated slightly to 15,5 per cent in January from 17,6 per cent in December. This latter category is mainly made up of unsecured lending, where loans to households continue to grow at rates of around 30 per cent. While this is still a relatively small proportion of total loans and advances, it appears to be an increasingly important source of funding of consumer credit. At this stage it is not translating into excessive consumption expenditure, but this trend towards unsecured lending is being carefully examined to ensure we have a better understanding of what constitutes this lending. Despite the resulting higher household indebtedness, the ratio of household debt to disposable income declined further to 74,6 per cent in the final quarter of 2011, compared with the peak of 82,7 per cent in the first quarter of 2008. The household debt service costs to disposable income are at levels well below their long term average. The recent national government budget tabled before parliament indicates a moderately tighter fiscal policy stance compared with that in the October 2011 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS), and the commitment to medium term fiscal consolidation remains. The fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP is now budgeted to be 4,6 per cent in the 2012/13 fiscal year, compared with 5,2 per cent in the MTBPS, and to decline to 3,0 per cent by 2014/15. The government gross debt/GDP ratio is expected to peak at 42,4 per cent in 2014/15 (and the net debt/GDP ratio at 38,5 per cent), which is much lower than the international benchmark for debt sustainability of around 60 per cent. Cost push pressures remain the main drivers of inflation, but there have been some favourable developments with respect to administered prices. NERSA accepted Eskom's proposal for an average electricity tariff increase of 16 per cent for the 12 months beginning 1 April compared with the previous approved increase of 25,9 per cent. The guidelines for municipal tariff increases is 11,03 per cent compared with 16,6 per cent previously. Nevertheless nearly all administered price increases remain in excess of upper end of the target range, apart from communication and television licenses. Wage settlements remain on average in excess of inflation. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements declined to 7,7 per cent in 2011. Growth in nominal remuneration per worker declined from 8,8 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 2011, to 6,0 per cent in the fourth quarter. Unit labour costs declined from 8,4 per cent to 5,0 per cent over this period. Oil prices remain a risk to the outlook and have increased by around US$15 per barrel since the previous meeting, mainly as a result of increased geopolitical risk. While an escalation of these risks could cause further upward pressures, oil price increases are likely to be constrained by the fact that higher oil prices could derail the global recovery and therefore reduce demand. Domestic petrol prices have been impacted by these global developments. In the past two months, petrol prices have increased by 62 cents per litre, but would have been significantly higher were it not for the more appreciated exchange rate. A further sizeable increase is expected in April, which will include a 28 cent per litre increase in the fuel levy. Food prices remain an important determinant of inflation, and as noted earlier, were the main contributors to the downward movement of CPI inflation in March. Some further moderation, partly a result of base effects, may be expected over the coming months. Global food price indices had been declining consistently in 2011, but there has been some reversal of this trend in January and February. Nevertheless global food prices remain well below the levels reached in the first few months of 2011. The impact of these developments on domestic prices will also depend on the rand exchange rate and local harvests. There has been some moderation in domestic grain price increases, following sharp increases in maize prices in the second half of 2011. We therefore could see a further moderation in food price inflation in the coming months, but the longer term outlook is uncertain. The MPC is of the view that while the main pressures on inflation are of a cost push nature, there is some evidence that these pressures may be becoming more broad-based. However these developments are in line with our previous forecasts and are expected to remain contained by the relatively subdued state of the domestic economy. Although at this stage the Committee assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be fairly evenly balanced, greater vigilance will be required going forward. The main upside risk to inflation is seen to emanate from global oil prices, and while food price inflation is expected to moderate in the short run, the longer term risks remain. The exchange rate is, as always, highly uncertain, but the risk posed to inflation in recent months has subsided somewhat given the less volatile, albeit uncertain, global environment. Domestic economic growth is expected to remain below potential. In light of this and the expected medium-term inflation trajectory, the Committee is of the view that at this stage the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support the real economy while at the same time maintaining its commitment to achieve the inflation target over the medium term. The Monetary Policy Committee has therefore decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,5 per cent per annum."
Pakistan,2012-04-01,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 13 April 2012 As the economy begins the last quarter of current fiscal year. SBP's monetary management continues to play its part in balancing the implications of multiple challenges faced by the economy. The primary consideration remains bringing inflation further down as it has persistently remained in double digits in the last few years. Ensuring smooth functioning of the payment system and financial stability is also important given the current stressed liquidity conditions in the market. Similarly elevated international oil prices, weak quantum of exports, and insufficient foreign financial flows require careful management of the external position. Last but not least, the consistent decline in private investment is also an important factor in formulating the monetary policy strategy as it impacts both the medium term inflation, growth and employment prospects. Given limited set of instruments, not all these challenges can be effectively tackled by monetary policy alone. There are bound to be tradeoffs involved among these competing considerations. supporting fiscal strategy and an active economic reform agenda is critical to deal with some of the structural issues, in particular, low tax to GDP ratio and energy shortages. Most importantly, the economy needs forward-looking approach to policy making with strict adherence to rules laid out in the legal frameworks, be it the State Bank of Pakistan (Amendment) Act (2012) or Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation (FRDL) Act (2005). Following this approach is crucial in anchoring inflation expectations around the medium term targets of. percent for FY13 and percent for FY14 as envisaged in the Medium Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF) of the government. In March 2012 the year-on-year CPI inflation was 10. percent and, given the current economic conditions, is projected to remain in double digits during FY13. Consistently growing government borrowing requirement from the banking system is key variable that is adversely affecting the inflation outlook. Weak private demand, on the other hand, is one reason why inflation is not increasing sharply. Nonetheless the size of fiscal borrowings and lack of investment is eroding the medium term productive capacity of the economy, contributing towards persistence of inflation in early double digits. Another risk factor that needs to be monitored closely for assessing inflationary pressures is the behaviour of international oil prices. The current year government borrowings for budgetary support have been Rs373 billion from the scheduled banks and Rs218 billion from the SBP during 1st July 30th March. FY12. The year-on- year growth in these borrowings turns out to be 56. percent and 18. percent respectively. The year-on-year growth in the private sector credit, on the other hand, was only. percent and that in total deposits of the banking system was 17. percent during the same period. Thus despite decent growth in deposits, the banks continue to prefer financing the fiscal deficit as opposed to searching avenues, taking risk, and building partnerships to facilitate credit to the private sector. The cost to the economy is visible in terms of decline in investment to GDP ratio to historically low levels and stagnant economic growth that is considerably lower than the economy's potential. If revival in private sector credit and growth prospects is to take place, pertinent question in the current circumstances is: how would the government rollover its maturing short-term debt and raise additional financing while simultaneously retiring its borrowings from the SBP? With shortfalls in Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN external sources, the most likely avenue will be more borrowings from the SBP. The inflationary implications of this scenario should not be underestimated. However according to the recent State Bank of Pakistan (Amendment) Act (2012), government borrowing from the SBP is required to be repaid at the end of each quarter and the existing stock is to be retired within eight years. In case of not observing these provisions, the Act also stipulates that the federal government will submit statement to the Parliament giving detailed justification. Adherence to this legal requirement, without serious adjustment in the fiscal position, would lead to significant injections of liquidity by the SBP to keep the payment system functioning and financial markets stable. But SBP is already injecting substantial short term liquidity in the system. Rs200 billion as of 13th April 2012, which is being continuously rolled over. The permanent nature of these injections also potentially carries inflationary risks. Thus simultaneously meeting the legal requirement of zero quarterly borrowings from SBP, scaling back liquidity injections, effectively anchoring inflation expectations, and creating space for the private sector, could prove to be much more difficult task than appreciated. Government borrowing requirements are not the only source of liquidity pressures. With gradually rising external current account deficit and consistently declining foreign inflows, the SBP's foreign exchange reserves are on declining path. During the first eight months of FY12, the external current account deficit was $3 billion while the net capital and financial account receipts were only $187 million. Not surprisingly. SBP's liquid foreign exchange reserves have declined to $11. billion by end-March 2012 from $14. billion at end-June 2011. These external sector developments are exerting downward pressure on rupee liquidity as indicated by 21. percent year-on year decline in Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the banking system by end-March 2012. Thus some rupee liquidity injection and increase in reserve money is required to facilitate normal transactions taking place in the economy. Further SBP's operational monetary management framework sets the short term interest rate or the price of liquidity based on broad macroeconomic considerations such as likely inflation path relative to the announced target. The requirement of liquidity and thus growth in reserve money is residually determined and provided to ensure smooth functioning of financial markets. The SBP cannot simultaneously set both the interest rates and money growth. The challenge is if the underlying behaviour of significant user of money does not respond to interest rate signals, then monetary policy would become ineffective in achieving its objectives. Given substantial external debt payments, declining trend of export quantum, elevated international oil prices, and weak financial inflows, the external position is likely to remain under pressure in the remaining part of FY12 and FY13. Similarly provisional financing data indicate that the fiscal deficit may have reached. percent of GDP during the first nine months of FY12. Given the last quarter seasonality, substantial slippage compared to the revised target of. of GDP cannot be ruled out. Both these developments would have implications for variables that concern monetary policy such as inflation expectations, liquidity pressures, and private investment. In terms of solutions, the economy needs deep and decisive fiscal and energy sector reforms and an early realization of planned foreign financial inflows to mitigate uncertainty. Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Another area of reform is to improve financial deepening and competition in the banking system. In this vein. SBP has already been encouraging depositors to put their savings in government securities through Investor's Portfolio Securities (IPS) accounts. Among other objectives, this is expected to lead to better returns on deposits over time. Moreover in May 2008. SBP introduced minimum percent floor on all categories of Savings/PLS Saving Products. Consequently average deposit rate of all saving related products increased from. percent to.25 percent, with no significant change thereafter. The saving deposits category now account for 38 percent of all bank deposits and 52 percent of total number of deposit accounts. It was the expectation of SBP that these deposits will respond to market forces and adjust accordingly. The rigidity of the deposit rates, especially for small savers, is adversely impacting the savings-investment ratio of the economy. more balanced risk-reward incentive structure is warranted in the shape of appropriate deposit rate structure, as the savers, especially the smaller ones, need to be adequately compensated. Therefore it has been decided that, effective 1st May 2012, all Banks are required to pay minimum Profit Rate of. percent on PKR Saving/PLS Saving Products. At the same time, given the overall macroeconomic conditions, the Central Board of Directors has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 12 percent. Page of."
Euroarea,2012-04-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since the beginning of March broadly confirms our previous assessment. Inflation rates are likely to stay above 2% in 2012, with upside risks prevailing. Over the policy-relevant horizon, we expect price developments to remain in line with price stability. Consistent with this picture, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. Survey indicators for economic growth have broadly stabilised at low levels in the early months of 2012, and a moderate recovery in activity is expected in the course of the year. Medium-term inflation expectations for the euro area economy must continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Over the last few months we have implemented both standard and non-standard monetary policy measures. This combination of measures has contributed to a stabilisation in the financial environment and an improvement in the transmission of our monetary policy. It is also important to keep in mind that all our non-standard monetary policy measures are temporary in nature and that all the necessary tools are available to address upside risks to medium-term price stability in a firm and timely manner. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP contracted by 0.3% in the euro area in the fourth quarter of 2011. Survey data confirm a stabilisation in economic activity at a low level in early 2012. We continue to expect the euro area economy to recover gradually in the course of the year. The outlook for economic activity should be supported by foreign demand, the very low short-term interest rates in the euro area, and all the measures taken to foster the proper functioning of the euro area economy. However, the remaining tensions in euro area sovereign debt markets and their impact on credit conditions, as well as the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors and high unemployment in parts of the euro area, are expected to continue to dampen the underlying growth momentum. They relate in particular to a renewed intensification of tensions in euro area debt markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to further increases in commodity prices. Euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.6% in March 2012, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 2.7% in the previous three months. Inflation is likely to stay above 2% in 2012, mainly owing to recent increases in energy prices, as well as recently announced rises in indirect taxes. On the basis of current futures prices for commodities, annual inflation rates should fall below 2% again in early 2013. In this context, we will pay particular attention to any signs of pass-through from higher energy prices to wages, profits and general price-setting. However, looking ahead, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain limited. Risks to the outlook for HICP inflation rates in the coming years are still seen to be broadly balanced, with upside risks in the near term mainly stemming from higher than expected oil prices and indirect tax increases. Downside risks continue to exist owing to weaker than expected developments in economic activity. The monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained subdued. The annual growth rate of M3 was 2.8% in February 2012, compared with 2.5% in January. In both January and February we observed a strengthening in the deposit base of banks. Annual loan growth to the private sector has remained subdued, with the rate (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) moderating in February to 1.1% year on year, from 1.5% in January. The annual growth rates of loans to non-financial corporations and loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.6% and 1.8% respectively in February. The volume of MFI loans to non-financial corporations and households remained practically unchanged compared with the previous month. Money and credit data up to February confirm a broad stabilisation of financial conditions and thereby the avoidance of an abrupt and disorderly adjustment in the balance sheets of credit institutions, as intended by our measures. Funding conditions for banks have generally improved, and there has been increased issuance activity and a re-opening of some segments of funding markets. The demand for credit remains weak in the light of still subdued economic activity and the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in non-financial sectors. The full supportive impact of the Eurosystem's non-standard measures will need time to unfold and to have a positive effect on the growth of loans when demand recovers. In this context, it should be noted that the second three-year longer-term refinancing operation was only settled on 1 March 2012. Following the stabilisation in the financial environment, it is essential for banks to strengthen their resilience further, including by retaining earnings. The soundness of banks' balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. In order to support confidence, sustainable growth and employment, the Governing Council calls upon governments to restore sound fiscal positions and implement strong structural reforms. Commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact need to be fully honoured and weaknesses in competitiveness forcefully addressed. National policy-makers need to fully meet their responsibilities to ensure fiscal sustainability, to increase the adjustment capacity of product and labour markets, to enhance productivity and competitiveness, and to ensure the soundness of their financial system. In particular, countries which have suffered losses in cost competitiveness need to ensure sufficient wage adjustment and foster productivity growth. Let me conclude by recalling that the single monetary policy naturally focuses on maintaining medium-term price stability for the euro area as a whole. It is up to national policy-makers to foster domestic developments which support the competitiveness of their economies. Both prudent fiscal policies and competitive and flexible product and labour markets are of crucial importance for the functioning of the euro area economy."
Poland,2012-04-04,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 4 April 2012 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 3-4 April 2012 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate at 4.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 6.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 3.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 4.75% on an annual basis. Global economic growth remains low. Recession in the euro area is accompanied by continued moderate growth in the United States. Economic activity in some major emerging economies is still weakening. Global economic growth is being hampered by the ongoing adjustments in balance sheets of enterprises and households in some developed countries as well as by high fuel prices. Despite some decline, global inflation remains heightened, still driven by high commodity prices. Following an earlier appreciation, exchange rates of emerging economies' currencies, including the Polish zloty saw some stabilization. Some indicators on the Polish economy, including industrial and construction output, together with several leading business indicators signal some weakening of economic growth. However other data, including retail sales, indicate that the slowdown should not be considerable. Unemployment rate in February remained elevated. At the same time, employment in companies declined and wage growth retuned to a moderate level. Lending to corporates continued to rise, though its growth was somewhat slower. The growth of household loans continued to fall, which was driven by persistent decline in consumer loans and further decrease in growth of mortgage loans. In February 2012, the annual CPI inflation rose to 4.3%, remaining markedly above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. A slight increase was also noted in core inflation, mainly as a result of growth in prices of tobacco products following a rise in excise tax rates. At the same time growth in producer prices weakened. Some decline was also observed in inflation expectations of enterprises and households, though they remain relatively high. In the opinion of the Council, in the medium term, inflation will be curbed to some extent by the expected economic slowdown amid moderate wage growth as well as continued fiscal tightening. The zloty appreciation at the beginning of 2012 will also be conducive to lower inflation. In the short term, inflation  despite some expected decline  will probably remain above the NBP's inflation target. Heightened inflation will be supported by the previously observed 00-919 Warszawa, ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, phone 22 653 28 88, fax 22 653 13 28 depreciation of the zloty and persistently high commodity prices. High growth in regulated prices will also contribute to elevated inflation. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. In the opinion of the Council, the expected mild economic slowdown in Poland over the monetary policy horizon increases the probability of inflation remaining above the target in the medium term. Given the above, the Council will consider tightening of monetary policy in the nearest future, unless signs of considerable economic weakening in Poland appear and the outlook for inflation returning to the target improves."
Armenia,2012-04-09,"Press Release 04.09.2012 Interest rate unchanged, 8 percent In the September 4th of 2012 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. There was 0.4 percent deflation recorded in August of 2012, and the 12-month inflation amounted to 2.5 percent, which coincides with lower bound of the confidence band. The Board admitted that in August both external and domestic economies have been progressing in line with the baseline scenario as outlined in the third quarter's monetary policy program. In the light of uncertainties over political solutions to debt problems in developed countries the low global demand will persist over the forecast horizon. In the meanwhile, the food markets of the world are seeing inflationary environment due to the persistently increasing prices in world wheat markets over the last couple of months which has already partially reflected in domestic prices. The Board evaluated that domestic economic developments will continue to put inflationary impact on domestic prices as expected over the forecast horizon due to faster growth rates of private consumption.The latter will be somewhat mitigated through contractionary fiscal policy. Inflationary developments over the last months indicate that they are mostly consistent with the baseline scenario as outlined in the third quarter's monetary policy program. As a result, the Board of the Central Bank follows the main monetary policy directions under the program. Under such circumstances, over the forecast horizon the 12-month inflation is expected to rest within the confidence band of 4% +/- 1.5 pp. In the meanwhile, aimed to reduce interest rate fluctuations in interbank market, the Board keeps on reducing the spread between Deposit facility rate and Lombard Repo facility rate making a decision to lower it from 5 pp to 4 pp. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in the Minutes on Interest Rate due on June 15, 2012.

Russia,2012-04-09,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 9 April 2012 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain the refinancing rate and the interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations unchanged (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects. In March inflation rate remained low — at 3.7% over a year ago, while core inflation rate declined to 5.5%. This tendency is expected to be short-term. Medium-term inflation risks are amplified by the uncertainty surrounding the scale of influence on consumer prices of an increase in the majority of regulated prices and tariffs planned for July. The dynamics of a number of macroeconomic indicators in February points to an improvement in economic conditions. Industrial production growth accelerated and the growth rate of investment in production capacity in year-over-year terms remained high. The dynamics of real wage and household credit activity as well as the low rate of unemployment provide for the sustainability of consumer demand. The Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia also decided to set the maximum interest rate on the 1 week deposit auctions at 4.75% per annum starting from 10 April 2012. Adding a short-term market sterilization instrument to the existing toolset of the Bank of Russia will contribute to the reduction of money market interest rates volatility and enhancement of the effectiveness of the interest rate policy. Considering recent domestic and international macroeconomic developments the Bank of Russia judged that the current level of money market interest rates within the interest rate corridor was appropriate for the coming months. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks and in making monetary policy decisions will rely on medium-term inflation forecasts and the dynamics of inflation expectations.

South Korea,2012-04-13,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers some economic indicators in the US to have shown trends of further improvement, but economic activities in the euro area to have remained sluggish. Growth in emerging market economies has continued to exhibit signs of weakening, due mostly to slowing exports. Going forward, the Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be moderate, and judges that risk factors still exist, including the sovereign debt problems in Europe and geopolitical risks in the Middle East. In Korea, although export growth has slowed the Committee appraises economic growth to have shown signs of a moderate recovery, with consumption and construction investment increasing. On the employment front, the uptrend in the number of persons employed is being sustained, led by the private sector. The Committee anticipates that the domestic economic growth rate will gradually return to its long-term trend going forward, although downside risks remain due mostly to the impacts of external risk factors. Consumer price inflation fell to 2.6% in March, influenced chiefly by the expansion of government subsidies for childcare fees and free school meals, and core inflation dropped compared to the previous month as well. The Committee does however recognize the presence of potentially destabilizing factors, such as the ongoing high inflation expectations and the geopolitical risks in the Middle East. In the housing market, prices remained on a decline in Seoul and its surrounding areas and on a rise in the rest of the country, while the uptrend in leasehold deposits nationwide was maintained. In the financial markets, price variables displayed fluctuations for a time, affected for instance by conditions in the major economies and international financial markets, after which stock prices then fell and the Korean won depreciated against the US dollar. Long-term market interest rates continued to rise, mitigating the degree of yield curve inversion. Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and economic risk factors both at home and abroad and endeavoring to lower inflation expectations, will conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the midpoint of the inflation target over a medium-term horizon amid continuing sound growth of the economy."
Peru,2012-04-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2012 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent This decision is based, on the one hand, on the fact that inflation's deviation from the target has been mainly due to transitory supply factors and, on the other hand, on the fact that the economy's pace of growth is close to its potential rate of growth. Moreover, inflation expectations for this year are anchored within the target range. Future adjustments in the reference interest rate will depend on the evolution of inflation and its determinants Inflation in March registered a monthly rate of 0.77 percent, reflecting mainly the rise in the prices of education (tuition and fees) and chicken, items which contributed with 0.55 percentage points to the rate of inflation this month. As a result of this, the annual rate of inflation recorded 4.23 percent. Moreover, core inflation in March showed a rate of 0.62 percent and thus accumulated a rate of 3.82 percent in the last 12 months. Inflation excluding food and energy registered a rate of 0.57 percent and an annual rate of 2.47 percent. Inflation expectations for this year and for next year fall within the target range. Even though rises in the international prices of fuels and domestic supply shocks are being observed, the impact of these factors on inflation is expected to reverse more strongly since mid-2012 and the annual rate of inflation is expected to converge thereafter towards the target range. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show that the economy's growth has stabilized around its long-term sustainable level of growth. On the other hand, indicators of global economic activity show that uncertainty about the pace of global economic activity persists. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Monetary Program for May will be approved on the Board's session of May 10, 2012."

Inflation expectations remain around the target in the projection horizon. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."

RBI First of all, on behalf of the Reserve Bank, a hearty welcome to all of you to this annual Monetary Policy for 2012-13. A short while ago, we put out our annual Monetary Policy Statement. Based on an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, we have decided to: reduce the repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 50 basis points. The repo rate will accordingly drop from 8.5 to 8.0 per cent. Consequent to this, the reverse repo rate under the LAF, determined with a spread of 100 basis points below the repo rate, gets calibrated to 7.0 per cent. Similarly, the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate, which has a spread of 100 bps above the repo rate, stands adjusted to 9.0 per cent. In order to provide greater liquidity cushion, we have also decided to raise the borrowing limit of scheduled commercial banks under the marginal standing facility (MSF) from one per cent to two per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL). These changes have come into effect immediately after the announcement. Considerations Behind the Policy Move 6. The decision to ease the monetary policy has been informed by two broad considerations. First, growth decelerated significantly to 6.1 per cent in the third quarter of last year, although it is expected to have recovered moderately in the fourth quarter. Based on current assessment, the economy is clearly operating below its post-crisis trend. The second consideration that shaped the policy decision is the decline in inflation. Headline WPI inflation which remained above 9 per cent for nearly two years has moderated significantly to below 7 per cent by March 2012. More importantly, non-food manufactured products inflation has dropped from a high of 8.4 per cent in November 2011 to 4.7 per cent in March 2012, actually coming below 5 per cent for the first time in two years. Moreover, if subsidies are not contained as indicated in the Union Budget last month, demand pressures will persist, and will further reduce whatever space there is for monetary easing. Revisions in administered prices may adversely impact headline inflation. But I would like to underscore that the appropriate monetary policy response to this should be based on whether the higher prices translate into generalized inflationary pressures. The likelihood of a pass-through of higher administered prices to generalised inflation depends on the strength of the pricing power in the economy. The pricing power is currently abating, but the risk of a pass-through cannot be ignored altogether. Overall, from the perspective of vulnerabilities emerging from the fiscal and current account deficits, it is imperative for macroeconomic stability that administered prices of petroleum products are increased to reflect their true costs of production. Liquidity management posed a major challenge for much of last year. However, liquidity conditions have eased in recent weeks, and are now steadily moving towards the comfort zone of the Reserve Bank. This is reflected in the decline in banks' borrowings from the LAF and the behaviour of money market rates. The increase in the MSF limit to banks that we just announced should provide additional liquidity comfort. However, should the situation change, appropriate and proactive steps will be taken with the objective of restoring comfort zone conditions. Expected Outcomes 14. We expect that today's policy actions, and the guidance that we have given, will result in the following three outcomes: First, growth will stabilise around its current post-crisis trend. Second, risks of inflation and inflation expectations re-surging will be contained. 23 per cent. Inflation 21. Moving on to inflation, headline WPI inflation, which remained above 9 per cent during April-November 2011, moderated to 6.9 per cent by end- March 2012. This moderation was consistent with the Reserve Bank's indicative projection of 7 per cent. Food articles inflation continues to be high. Significantly. inflation in protein items is in double digits, reflecting persistent structural demand-supply imbalances in protein foods. Fuel inflation, on the other hand, moderated from over 15 per cent in November-December 2011 to 10.4 per cent in March 2012 even as global 34. Non-food manufactured products inflation decelerated significantly from 8.4 per cent in November 2011 to 4.7 per cent in March 2012, on the back of a slowdown in domestic demand and softening of global non-oil commodity prices. Even as WPI inflation has softened, inflation as measured by the new series of consumer price index (CPI) suggests that price pressures are still high at the retail level. Looking ahead, based on an assessment of the domestic demand- supply balance, global trends in commodity prices and the likely demand scenario, the Reserve Bank's projection of inflation for March 2013 is 6.5 per cent. Monetary and Liquidity Conditions 27. Let me now move on to monetary and liquidity conditions. Consistent with growth and inflation projections. M growth for 2012-13 is projected at 15 3 per cent. Keeping in view the need to balance the resource requirements of the private sector and the public sector, growth in non-food credit of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) is projected at 17 per cent. As I said earlier, liquidity management remained a major challenge for the Reserve Bank during last year. Beginning November 2011, the liquidity deficit went much beyond the comfort level of the Reserve Bank. In order to redress this, we took steps to inject primary liquidity of a more durable nature. We injected liquidity of around 1.3 trillion through open market operations and 0.8 trillion through reduction in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 125 basis points. As a result of these measures and the easing of government's cash balances, the net borrowing under the LAF, which peaked at 2 trillion at end-March 2012, declined to 0.7 trillion on April 13, 2012. Risk Factors 29. Finally, let me highlight the risks to our indicative projections of growth and inflation for 2012-13: First, a major risk to our growth and inflation projections stems from the outlook for global commodity prices, especially of crude oil. Although upside risks to oil prices from the demand side are limited, geo-political tensions are a concern. Any disruption in supplies is likely to lead to further increase in crude oil prices. The second risk emanates from the fiscal situation. Even though the Budget has proposed a reduction in the fiscal deficit in the current year, there are several upside risks. Any slippage in the fiscal deficit will have implications for inflation. Third, the large Government borrowing budgeted for 2012-13 has the potential to crowd out credit to the private sector. If that happens, the supply response required to accelerate growth could be inhibited. 450 per cent or more of its total financial assets, from the existing 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent of bank's capital funds. Second, banks should have an internal sub-limit on their aggregate exposure to all such NBFCs, having gold loans to the extent of 50 per cent or more of their total financial assets, taken together. Non-performing assets of banks have increased in the recent period. We are mandating banks to put in place a robust mechanism for early detection of signs of distress and take remedial measures. Final guidelines on securitisation will be issued by end-April 2012. Finally, let me touch upon two measures concerning currency management. First, with a view to address the issue of counterfeit notes in circulation, banks are advised to ensure that notes received over the counters are re-circulated only after ensuring their proper authentication through machines. Second, keeping in view the extended geographical spread of bank branch network and leveraging on technology, we have decided to channelize the distribution of currency and coins only through currency chests and bank branches. For details of these measures, as also measures that I have not touched upon. I invite you to refer to the full Policy Statement, which is available on the Reserve Bank's website. Let me now conclude by summarising our macroeconomic concerns. Though inflation has moderated in recent months, it remains sticky and above the tolerance level, even as growth has slowed. These trends are occurring in a situation in which concerns over the fiscal deficit, the current account deficit and deteriorating asset quality loom large. The challenge for monetary policy will thus be to maintain its vigil on controlling inflation while being sensitive to risks to growth and other vulnerabilities. Thank you for your attention."
Mongolia,2012-04-17,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Ref No: 2012/04 Effective from: April 17, 2012 Embargo: Not for publication or broadcast before 1500 hours on Tuesday, 25 April 2012. April 17, 2012- BoM Board of Directors decided to increase the policy rate by 0.5 unit percent to 13.25% and the required reserve by 1 unit percent to 12%. The National Statistical Office of Mongolia reported that the national CPI increased to 15.3% (YOY) and the CPI of Ulaanbaatar increased to 17.3% (YOY) as of March, 2012. The negative effects of supply on inflation remain strong. The price of meat increased by 51.8% (YTD) and contributed to the 68.2% of inflation as well as the price of non-food products increased by 2.4% (YTD) and contributed to the 29.3% of inflation. The cost of fuel was also increased by 7.1% (YTD). Increasing demand has a risk to even further accelerate the caused by supply factors inflation speed. Strong inflow puts upward pressure on excessive demand caused by budget and quasi-budget expenses. On above grounds the Bank of Mongolia is tightening the policy rate to contain the inflation and the pressure on MNT and to maintain the stability of macroeconomy. BANK OF MONGOLIA."
Philippines,2012-04-18,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy rates at 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also maintained accordingly. The reserve requirement ratios were kept steady as well. The Monetary Board's assessment of a favorable inflation environment formed the primary basis for the latest monetary policy decision. Latest baseline forecasts continue to indicate that inflation will likely settle near the lower half of the 3-5 percent target range in 2012 and 2013, while inflation expectations have remained well anchored. The Monetary Board also noted that while global economic conditions remain fragile, prospects for overall domestic economic activity are gradually strengthening. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook now leans slightly toward the upside as oil prices have remained elevated and at risk from ongoing tensions in the Middle East as well as strong demand from emerging economies. Potential pass-through from higher energy prices to other prices also constitutes another source of upside inflation risk. Other upside risks relate to the impact of sustained foreign exchange inflows on domestic liquidity. Meanwhile, the weak global economy and the stable peso could provide a moderating effect on inflation. The uncertainty in the factors affecting the outlook for inflation therefore suggests a need for a pause in monetary policy adjustment. A prudent pause allows policymakers to better assess how the upside and downside risks to inflation will play out and enables the cumulative 50-basis-point reduction in policy rates earlier in the year to continue to work its way through the economy. Going forward, the BSP will continue to pay close attention to the outlook for inflation and growth to ensure that monetary policy settings remain consistent with price stability while being supportive of non-inflationary economic growth."
Turkiye,2012-04-18,"Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand continues as envisaged. While consumption demand shows a significant slowdown in the first quarter, leading indicators suggest a modest recovery for the second quarter. Exports continue to grow at a steady pace. Accordingly, despite the elevated oil prices, the improvement in the current account balance is expected to continue in the forthcoming period. Main factors affecting inflation are broadly in line with the outlook presented in the January Inflation Report. Yet, inflation may hover above the envisaged path in the short term due to hikes in energy prices. The Committee will not tolerate temporary factors to have an adverse impact on the inflation outlook. Accordingly, it was underscored that additional monetary tightening may be implemented more frequently in the forthcoming period. The Committee stated that, given the prevailing uncertainties regarding the global economy, it would be appropriate to preserve the flexibility of the monetary policy. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2012-04-23,"23.04.2012 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for May 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.4 percent in March, at the upper bound of the range of forecasts, and above the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target. In recent months, the rate of inflation measured over the previous 12 months has remained stable near the middle of the target range (1-3 percent); in March the figure was 1.9 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The average of forecasters' inflation predictions, and inflation expectations for the next twelve CPIreadings based on over-the-counter CPI futures contracts offered by banks,remained stable at 2.5 percent. One year forward inflation expectations ascalculated from the capital markets (break-even inflation) declined from around 3 percent at the beginning of the month, to 2.5 percent in the last few days. This was due to the ending of a seasonal bias evident in recent months. Professional forecasters project an increase of 0.9 percent in the CPI for April, and an increase of 0.4 percent for May, relatively high figures, primarily due to seasonal factors. Inflation expectations for the mediumterm were stable at 2.6 percent, and for longer terms, at 2.4 percent. Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now, based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, are 2.7 percent, and expectations calculated from the makam yield curve are 2.6 percent. The average of forecasters' predictions of the interest rate in one year's time was 2.6 percent, compared with average projections of 2.5 percent last month.Forecasters project that the Bank of Israel interest rate will remain unchanged for the next three months. Real economic activity: Indicators of real economic activity thatbecame available this month are consistent with the growth forecast published last month by the Bank of Israel, according to which growth in 2012 will be 3.1 percent, and surveys indicate that concern of a further decline in the rate of GDP growth has eased. National Accounts data for the fourth quarter of 2011 were revised upward. The GDP growth rate was revised to 3.4 percent, similar to its level in the third quarter. The Bank of Israel's Companies Survey indicates acceleration in business sector activity in the first quarter of 2012, and expectations for second quarter activity are positive, primarily in the commerce and business services sectors. The Central Bureau of Statistics survey of business trends for the first quarter indicates that the slowdown in activity is ending, with a significant improvement in March regarding expectations of future activity. The Research Department's index based on Google searches, which serves as an indicator of demand in the economy in the coming months, forecasts demand growth above the trend in recent months. Although the Purchasing Managers Index is still below 50,the boundary between contraction and expansion of activity, it increased in March to 46.3 points, continuing its increase in the previous month, witha positive change in most of its components. The Composite State-of-the-Economy Index increased by 0.2 percent in March. Among its component indices,the manufacturing production index declined by 2.2 percent in February, after an increase of 0.7 percent in January. The trade and services revenue index was unchanged in February after a decline of 1.8 percent in January. There was continued weakness in goods exports, which declined by 1.2 percentin March, following a 0.6 percent decline in February. The labor market: This month, the Labour Force Survey (for January and February) was published, with data calculated using a different method. According to this survey, the unemployment rate was 6.5 percent in February, compared with 6.6 percent in January, and 6.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, in concatenated figures. This contrasts with the unemployment rate of 5.4 percent in the last quarter of 2011 according to the survey published according to the previous methodology. The participation rate in February declined to 62.2 percent from 62.6 percent in January. The employment rate declined to 58.2 percent in February from 58.4 percent in January. The unemployment rates calculated according to the new method worsen Israel's position relative to other countries, but still leave it relatively favorably positioned compared with many other advanced economies. Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of total wage payments, were 4.5 percent higher in March in nominal terms than in March 2011 (excluding the effectof legislative changes); in contrast. February receipts were 5.5 percent higher than February 2011. Nominal wages increased 0.6 percent in November-January, compared with the preceding three months, and real wages increased 0.1 percent. The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: The Bank of Israel Research Department compiled its quarterly staff forecast last month. GDP growth in 2012 was projected to be 3.1 percent, and 3.5 percent in 2013. The forecast projects an inflation rate of 2.6 percent over the next four quarters and an average interest rate in the first quarter of 2013 of 2.5 percent. The interest rate is forecast to begin increasing in the middle of 2013, under the assumption of a recovery in the global economy. Budget data: The domestic deficit in the first quarter of 2012 was NIS 0.4 billion, compared with a surplus of NIS 2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2011. The deficit is slightly greater than the seasonal path consistent with the forecast full year deficit of 3.3 percent of GDP, and is considerably greater than the figure required by the target deficit ceiling set by law, of 2 percent. The deviation from the path derives from lower than expected tax receipts in February and March. Likewise, the government's commitments for this year (wage agreements, defense expenditure, etc.) are about NIS 6 billion above the budget's expenditure ceiling. It should be noted, however, that the government has not in the past deviated from the expenditure ceiling, and that the danger to the expected budget deficit from an increase in government spending above the ceiling is much smaller than that arising from a potential decline in government receipts. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on March 25, 2012, through April 20, 2012, the shekel depreciated against the dollar by about 0.6 percent. Against the euro, the shekel appreciated about 0.45 percent, in line with the trend of the exchange rates of most major currencies against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel depreciated by about 0.25 percent. The capital and money markets: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on March 25, 2012, through April 20, 2012, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by 2.2 percent. This was a partial correction to the underperformance since the beginning of the year, a continuation of the positive trend of the previous month, and in contrast to the general global trend. Yields decreased in the government bond market, particularly in the unindexed segment, with the decline in inflation expectations for most terms to maturity. The yield gap between Israeli 10-year government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities widened this month by 25 basis points (b.p.) to 270 b.p.; this was due to a sharper decline in yields in the US. Makam yields were unchanged during the period along the entire curve at an average of 2.6 percent. This was despite a marked exit by nonresident investorsat the beginning of the month following the redemption of a bond series and a decline in market expectations regarding additional interest rate reductions by the Bank of Israel. The decline in the foreigners' share of makam holdings continued, and this month their holdings declined to under 4 percent. The trend of money market fund withdrawals halted this month, and therewere net new investments of NIS 500 million. Corporate bond mutual funds also attracted net new investments again this month, of around NIS 800 million. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spreadnarrowed slightly to 191 b.p., compared with 195 b.p. just before the previous interest rate decision. The Tel-Bond 20 Index increased by 1.6 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 Index by 0.8 percent. These returns were part of the positive domestic trend, and also came against the background of an update in Tel Bond indices at the beginning of the month, which increased the weighting of banks in those indices. Tel-Bond yield gaps vis-?-vis government bonds narrowed this month. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in March, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 0.9 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to oneyear) increased by 9 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The outstanding debt of the business sector increased in February by 0.6 percent, to NIS 771 billion. The increase in the debt derived primarily from the increase in outstanding bank credit. Total outstanding credit to households declined by 0.3 percent,to NIS 365 billion, but within the total the balance of outstanding housing credit increased by 0.3 percent, to NIS 260 billion. Despite a 14 percentincrease in new mortgages granted in March (apparently partly due to seasonal factors), total mortgages granted in the twelve months ending in March was 3 percent lower than that advanced in the twelve months to February, continuing the decline from the peak level in May 2011. Unindexed floating rate mortgages granted in March constituted 27 percent of total new mortgages. Interest rates on all mortgage tracks declined this month. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (representing rents) increased in March by 0.4 percent. In the past twelve months it increased by 4.4 percent. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased in January-February by 0.3 percent, after declining 0.1 percent in December-January. In the twelve months to March, the rate of increase of home prices declined to 3.2 percent, compared with a rate of 4.1 in the twelve months to February, continuing the slowdown in the rate of increase in home prices. The ratio of home prices to rents increased by 0.1 percent in January, but remains 3.1 percent lower than the peak level recorded in March 2011. Activity in the construction industry continues to be strong. There were 44,587 building starts in the twelve months to January, compared with 44,575 in the twelve months to December, and the number of completions was 33,712 compared with the previous month's figure of 33,994. Although in February the number of homes available for sale built by the private sector declined by 3 percent, the decline came after a marked increase in the number of homes available for sale since the second quarter of 2011, the result of a sharp increase in building starts since the end of 2009. Thus, the number of homes for sale is still at the levels of 2003-07. The moderation in the rate of increase in home prices in recent months comes against the background of the continued increase in the number of building starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation. These moves, together with land marketing efforts by the Ministry of Construction and Housing and the Israel Land Administration, are expected to continue to have a moderating effect on price increases. The global economy: Following a period of some easing of concernsover the European debt crisis, these increased again this month, with a renewed focus on Spain and to some extent on Italy. Macroeconomic data from around the world continue to indicate a slow recovery in the global economy,with a slight slowdown in growth in the US. The mixed trend in the emerging market economies continued, and the growth rate in China was lower than expected. Against this background, the IMF revised its forecast of growth and world trade, reflecting the improvement in the markets since the deterioration in the European debt crisis at the end of 2011. The growth forecast for 2012 was increased by 0.2 percentage points to 3.5 percent, and that for 2013 by 0.1 percentage points, to 4.1 percent; the forecast for world trade was increased by 0.2 percentage points from the previous forecast, to 4 percent in 2012 and 5.6 percent in 2013. However, the IMF emphasized the risks to the recovery process. Inflation around the world remained moderate, and commodity prices declined this month. Most central banks kept their interest rates unchanged this month. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate for May 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policy that is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel, the global economy, monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following were the main considerations underlying the decision: The CPI increased by 0.4 percent in March, at the upper bound of the range of forecasts. For the third consecutive month, inflation over the previous 12 months is near the midpoint of the target inflation range, and in March was 1.9 percent. The housing and energy components of the CPI continued to contributesignificantly to inflation. Inflation expectations for the coming year arearound 2.5 percent. The relatively high figure derives primarily from the continuing increase in energy prices despite some decline in recent weeks, and from expectations that the housing (rent) component in the CPI will continue to increase at a relatively high rate. There do not appear to be other domestic inflationary demand pressures. Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate in the coming months are stable. Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month are consistent with the growth forecast published last month by the Bank of Israel, according to which growth in 2012 will be 3.1 percent. Based on various surveys, companies' expectations for future activity are slightly more positive than in previous surveys. After a period of relative calm in terms of concerns over the debt crisis in Europe, concerns of a renewed worsening increased this month. Global macro figures continued this month again to indicate a slower rate of recovery in the global economy, with some slowing in growth in the US and China. With that, this month the IMF revised upward its global growth and world trade forecastsslightly, while emphasizing the risks to the recovery process. Interest rates in major economies remained low, and markets are not pricing in an increase in the interest rate this year by any of the central banks of large advanced economies. The Fed has declared previously that it intends to maintain the federal funds rate at its near-zero level at least until the end of 2014. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in financial markets. The Bank will use thetools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the asset markets. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on May 7, 2012. The decision regarding the interest rate for June 2012 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. May 28, 2012. 23.04.2012 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for May 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent. The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for May 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent.

Hungary,2012-04-24,"At its meeting on 24 April 2012, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 7.00%. In the Council's judgement, the Hungarian economy is likely to stagnate this year, with growth expected to resume in 2013. The level of output will remain below its potential in the period ahead. The consumer price index is expected to rise significantly, reflecting the effects of increases in VAT and excise duties in 2011 and 2012 as well as the depreciation of the forint exchange rate in the second half of 2011 and the rise in oil prices in early 2012. The latest Government measures, announced as part of the Structural Reform Programme, are likely to result in an increase in inflation in 2013 while causing aggregate demand to contract, which in turn may reduce the risk of second-round effects on inflation. The inflation data released over the past month was broadly in line with the projection in the March Quarterly Report for Inflation. The rate of increase of consumer prices slowed in March relative to levels experienced in previous months, as reflected in a decline in measures of underlying inflation. Recent real economy data confirmed that domestic industrial production growth stalled in early 2012, reflecting weak external demand conditions. That in turn may set back the recovery in the economy. The Council expects that activity in Hungary's export markets will pick up gradually from mid-2012, which is likely to affect growth in exports. By contrast, domestic demand is expected to fall further in the coming quarters. Uncertainty surrounding the prospects for income growth and the contractionary effects of fiscal consolidation on aggregate demand continue to point to weak growth in investment and household consumption. Government measures aimed to ensure that the deficit target is met are required for perceptions about Hungary to improve. One of the key challenges facing the economy is ensuring the sustainability of government debt, which requires that the country's ability to attract capital and its long-term growth potential be improved. The structure of measures taken to meet the government deficit target is vitally important in this regard. In the Council's view, it is important that the new taxes announced by the Government are introduced in a way which minimises their distorting effects on the economy. Perceptions about the Hungarian economy have deteriorated in the past month, mainly driven by global factors, including problems with the sustainability of sovereign debt in some euro-area countries. Over the past few quarters, risk premia demanded by investors for holding Hungarian assets have remained stuck at high levels relative to the performance of the economy, which affects negatively the country's ability to finance its debt. The Council therefore continues to consider it important that an agreement between the Government and the EU and IMF on the provision of a financial safety net for Hungary be reached as soon as possible. Such an agreement would reduce the risks associated with financing the government debt and slow the pace of withdrawals of foreign funding from the domestic banking sector, being one of the most important obstacles to economic recovery. The Monetary Council has decided to leave the base rate unchanged. Monetary policy can best contribute to economic growth by maintaining a predictable economic environment, ensuring price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system. High volatility of risk perceptions and recent trends in underlying inflation continue to warrant a cautious policy stance. The Council will take all efforts to ensure that the measures announced by the Government do not contribute to medium-term inflationary pressure and inflation returns to levels consistent with the Bank's medium-term inflation target, as the direct effects of the measures dissipate. In addition, the Council will give special attention to the impact of the Structural Reform Programme on perceptions of risks."
Georgia,2012-04-25,"25.04.2012 NBG Lowers Its Policy Rate By 25 Basis Points to 6.25% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on April 25, 2012 and decided to lower its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent. In the first quarter of the year the economic activity indicators pointed at high growth. Despite the latter the output gap is equal to zero, which indicates the absence of demand side inflationary pressures. The annual price change in March equaled -2.2%, the negative value of inflation mostly due to the base effect. In spite of the volatility of the consumer price index, prices are stable in the medium run. Namely, the core inflation (net of food and energy prices) has been mostly stable during recent years and was equal to 2%. The inflation forecast hasn't changed since the last MPC meeting. According to current prognosis, given the unchanged policy stance, inflation will remain low during this year and is expected to reach its target value by the beginning of the next year. Since the beginning of the year the banking system operated under the conditions of excess liquidity. As a result the interest rates on the short-term interbank market have decreased and drifted away from the policy rate, consequently causing the decrease in longer-term rates. Such interest rate decrease is effectively equal to policy easing. In the recent weeks the excess liquidity in the banking system has decreased, causing the increase in the interbank market interest rates, which under the current conditions might have an undesirable effect on the economy. Hence, it is reasonable to reduce the policy rate. At the same time the accumulation of the excess liquidity in the banking system increased the volatility of the interbank market interest rates. In order to reduce this volatility and increase the efficiency of the monetary policy the National Bank considers the possibility of selling the government securities, in order to sterilize the excess liquidity in the money market. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on May 23, 2012."
United States,2012-04-25,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately. Labor market conditions have improved in recent months; the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment have continued to advance. Despite some signs of improvement, the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has picked up somewhat, mainly reflecting higher prices of crude oil and gasoline. However, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up gradually. Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The increase in oil and gasoline prices earlier this year is expected to affect inflation only temporarily, and the Committee anticipates that subsequently inflation will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy. In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. The Committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September. The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Dennis P Lockhart; Sandra Pianalto; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Daniel K Tarullo; John C Williams; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M Lacker, who does not anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate through late 2014."
Romania,2012-05-02,"The NBR has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for May 8, 2012. Recent developments in macroeconomic indicators show continuing disinflation in line with NBR forecasts as well as a moderate recovery of lending activity also as a result of the transmission of monetary policy signals during past months. At the same time the persistent aggregate demand deficit as well as lower growth of exports amid a worsening of the short term economic growth outlook in Europe and globally are worth to be noted. The annual inflation rate fell to 2.4 percent in March from 2.6 percent in the previous month and 3.14 percent in December 2011, while a similar decreasing trend is witnessed by the annual adjusted CORE 21 inflation rate which reached 2.03 percent versus 2.37 percent in the last month of 2011. However, the average growth of aggregate prices over the last 12 months stood at 4.5 percent in March versus 5.8 percent in December 2011. The aggregate real broad monetary conditions have been permanently calibrated so as to achieve a consolidation of prospects for the inflation rate to continuously remain within the variation band around the target, thus helping the efforts to efficiently anchor anticipations and underpinnings for sustainable economic growth. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses developments in the recent macroeconomic environment and the inflation outlook and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the period ahead. The new forecast reiterates the prospects of the annual inflation rate to remain within the variation band around the target throughout the entire forecast horizon despite a temporary unfavorable statistical base effect which is to be expected in the second part of 2012. The short-term outlook is however affected by significant fluctuations of investors' risk appetite. This is correlated with changing expectations regarding the economic growth at global level and the impact of the beginning of a deleveraging process by some European Union credit institutions on the economies in Central and Eastern Europe. Domestic developments in the electoral context associated with the above-mentioned issues could heighten capital flow volatility. These risks and uncertainties thus require the maintenance of a prudent monetary policy stance for the aggregate broad monetary conditions in order to ensure an efficient anchoring of expectations with a view towards achieving price stability in the medium term. In this context, the NBR Board has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 5.25 percent per annum, to ensure the adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu-denominated and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR restates that achieving price and financial stability objectives in the context of the continued fulfillment of commitments under the external financial accords with the European Union. IMF and other financial institutions is crucial to ensure lasting economic growth in the context of a balanced macroeconomic policy mix. The NBR Board reaffirms that it will continue to closely monitor domestic and global developments so as by an adequate dosage of its instruments to ensure the fulfillment of its objectives to achieve price stability over the medium term, as well as financial stability. The quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for May 8, 2012. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for June 27, 2012. 1Calculated by the NBR by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index.

Thailand,2012-05-02,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 2 May 2012 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announces the outcome of the meeting today as follows. The global economy continued to grow at a gradual pace with improving signs of recovery relative to the previous meeting. Much of the improvement was attributed to a more favorable US economic outlook on the back of positive developments in the labor market and stronger private sector confidence. Meanwhile the euro zone economy entered a recession and it would take time for the structural problems to be resolved. Nonetheless underlying fundamentals of the core countries remained strong, with signs of improvements in the recovery relative to the previous quarter. While economic growth in Asia moderated, leading indicators pointed to a pickup in export activity toward the end of the second quarter. This was in line with improving global economic outlook in the latter half of the year. Risks to global inflation remained due to high oil prices and exceptionally accommodative stance of monetary policy in major industrial economies. The recovery of the Thai economy in the first quarter was faster than expected. On the whole, manufacturing production is projected to return to normal levels by the end of the second quarter this year. Private consumption and investment accelerated, supported by stronger consumer and business confidence along with greater domestic purchasing power. Exports were expected to rebound sooner than previously assessed in tandem with the recovery of manufacturing production. Government stimulus measures and accommodative monetary conditions would continue to support sustained economic recovery going forward. Inflation slowed down in April partly as a result of the high base of the previous year and the reduction of some fresh food prices back to their normal levels. However upward inflationary pressure in the period ahead remained. In the context of a strong pickup in domestic demand, the elevated oil prices and minimum wage were expected to result in greater pass-through of higher costs to prices of goods and services. The MPC assessed that the recent easing of monetary policy has helped to shore up private sector confidence and contributed to a broad-based recovery which has been faster than expected. However external factors continue to be a major risk to growth while inflation remains manageable. With the current level of the policy rate deemed to be appropriate in supporting a smooth recovery of economic activity to normal levels while keeping inflation within target, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 300 percent per annum at this meeting."
Czech Republic,2012-05-03,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 3rd Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 3 May 2012 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided by a majority vote to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.75%. Four members voted in favour of this decision, two members voted for lowering rates by 0.25 percentage point, and one member voted for increasing rates by 0.25 percentage point. Reasons for the decision Headline inflation will be close to its current elevated level as a result of a VAT increase. Monetary-policy relevant inflation will be in the upper half of the tolerance band this year. Both headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation will fall slightly below the target in 2013. Consistent with the forecast is a decline in market interest rates in the remainder of this year followed by a rise in rates as from 2013 H2. The message of the forecast baseline scenario Domestic factors (weak domestic demand and moderate wage growth) are currently curbing inflation. The VAT increase, food prices, administered prices and the gradual pass-through of the past weaker exchange rate to prices are the main sources of inflation. Headline inflation will be close to the current elevated values in 2012, but will fall below the target in 2013. Monetary-policy relevant inflation will be in the upper half of the tolerance band this year, but will fall slightly below the target in 2013. The Czech economy will stagnate this year as a result of a marked slowdown in external demand and continuing domestic fiscal consolidation. Next year, in connection with an external demand recovery. GDP growth will be just below 2%. Consistent with the forecast is a decline in market interest rates in the remainder of this year followed by a rise in rates as from 2013 H2. Fiscal restriction through a rise in both VAT rates and lower nominal disposable income of households will reduce household consumption in particular. This will result in slower GDP growth compared to the baseline scenario. The first-round effects of the increase in both VAT rates will cause headline inflation to rise. In line with past experience and the subdued economic activity, no significant second-round effects of the VAT rate hike on inflation are expected. The lower interest rates from the end of 2012 onwards are thus reacting only to the anti-inflationary pressure (visible in monetary-policy relevant inflation) generated by the slower GDP growth. The exchange rate is almost the same as in the baseline scenario."
Euroarea,2012-05-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I would like to thank Governor Fernández Ordóñez for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Rehn. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. However, over the policy-relevant horizon, we expect price developments to remain in line with price stability. Consistent with this picture, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. Available indicators for the first quarter remain consistent with a stabilisation in economic activity at a low level. Latest survey indicators for the euro area highlight prevailing uncertainty. Looking ahead, economic activity is expected to recover gradually over the course of the year. At the same time, as we said previously, the economic outlook continues to be subject to downside risks. Inflation expectations for the euro area economy continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Over the last few months we have implemented both standard and non-standard monetary policy measures. This combination of measures has helped both the financial environment and the transmission of our monetary policy. Further developments will be closely monitored, keeping in mind that all our non-standard monetary policy measures are temporary in nature and that we maintain our full capacity to ensure medium-term price stability by acting in a firm and timely manner. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Available indicators for the first quarter remain consistent with a stabilisation in economic activity at a low level. Latest signals from euro area survey data highlight prevailing uncertainty. At the same time, there are indications that the global recovery is proceeding. Looking beyond the short term, we continue to expect the euro area economy to recover gradually in the course of the year, supported by foreign demand, the very low short-term interest rates in the euro area, and all the measures taken to foster the proper functioning of the euro area economy. However, remaining tensions in some euro area sovereign debt markets and their impact on credit conditions, as well as the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors and high unemployment, are expected to continue to dampen the underlying growth momentum. As we said previously, this economic outlook continues to be subject to downside risks, relating in particular to an intensification of tensions in euro area debt markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy, as well as to further increases in commodity prices. Euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.6% in April 2012, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 2.7% in the previous four months. Inflation is likely to stay above 2% in 2012, mainly owing to increases in energy prices, as well as to rises in indirect taxes. On the basis of current futures prices for commodities, annual inflation rates should fall below 2% again in early 2013. In this context, we will pay particular attention to any signs of pass-through from higher energy prices to wages, profits and general price-setting. However, looking ahead, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain limited. Risks to the outlook for HICP inflation rates in the coming years are still seen to be broadly balanced. Upside risks pertain to higher than expected commodity prices and indirect tax increases, while downside risks relate to weaker than expected developments in economic activity. The monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained subdued, with somewhat higher growth rates in the past few months. The annual growth rate of M3 was 3.2% in March 2012, compared with 2.8% in February. Since January we have observed a strengthening in the deposit base of banks. The annual growth rates of loans to non-financial corporations and loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.5% and 1.7% respectively in March, both slightly lower than in February. The volume of MFI loans to non-financial corporations and households remained practically unchanged compared with the previous month. Money and credit data up to March confirm a broad stabilisation of financial conditions and thereby, as intended by our measures, the avoidance of an abrupt and disorderly adjustment in the balance sheets of credit institutions. In this context, the April bank lending survey indicates that the net tightening of credit standards by euro area banks declined substantially in the first quarter of 2012 as compared with late 2011, for both loans to non-financial corporations and loans to households, also on account of improvements in funding conditions for banks. As also indicated in the bank lending survey, the demand for credit remained subdued in the first quarter of 2012, reflecting weak economic activity and the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in non-financial sectors. The full supportive impact of the Eurosystem's non-standard measures will need time to unfold and to have a positive effect on the growth of loans when demand recovers. In this context, it should be noted that the second three-year longer-term refinancing operation was only settled on 1 March 2012. Looking ahead, it is essential for banks to strengthen their resilience further, including by retaining earnings. The soundness of banks' balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. It is of utmost importance to ensure fiscal sustainability and sustainable growth in the euro area. Most euro area countries made good progress in terms of fiscal consolidation in 2011. While the necessary comprehensive fiscal adjustment is weighing on near-term economic growth, its successful implementation will contribute to the sustainability of public finances and thereby to the lowering of sovereign risk premia. In an environment of enhanced confidence in fiscal balances, private sector activity should also be fostered, supporting private investment and medium-term growth. At the same time, together with fiscal consolidation, growth and growth potential in the euro area need to be enhanced by decisive structural reforms. In this context, facilitating entrepreneurial activities, the start-up of new firms and job creation is crucial. Policies aimed at enhancing competition in product markets and increasing the wage and employment adjustment capacity of firms will foster innovation, promote job creation and boost longer-term growth prospects. Reforms in these areas are particularly important for countries which have suffered significant losses in cost competitiveness and need to stimulate productivity and improve trade performance. In this context, let me make a few remarks on the adjustment process within the euro area. As we know from the experience of other large currency areas, regional divergences in economic developments are a normal feature. However, considerable imbalances have accumulated in the last decade in several euro area countries and they are now in the process of being corrected. As concerns the monetary policy stance of the ECB, it has to be focused on the euro area. Our primary objective remains to maintain price stability over the medium term. This is the best contribution of monetary policy to fostering growth and job creation in the euro area. Addressing divergences among individual euro area countries is the task of national governments. They must undertake determined policy actions to address major imbalances and vulnerabilities in the fiscal, financial and structural domains. We note that progress is being made in many countries, but several governments need to be more ambitious. Ensuring sound fiscal balances, financial stability and competitiveness in all euro area countries is in our common interest."
Egypt,2012-05-03,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release May 3, 2012 In its meeting held on May 3, 2012, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 925 percent 1025 percent, respectively, and the 7‐day repo at 975 percen. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 95 percen. Headline CPI increased by 122 percent (m/m) in March following 067 percent (m/m) in February, bringing the annual rate to 903 percent from 919 percent recorded in the previous mont. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 112 percent in March following 052 percent in February while the annual rate increased to 868 percent in March from 730 percent in the previous mont. The bulk of the latest monthly developments continued to be driven by food price movements while non‐food prices remained broadly tam. The re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels, as well as the probability of a rebound in international food prices pose upside risks to the inflation outloo. Meanwhile real GDP grew by a mere 04 percent in 2011/2012 Q2 after a similarly feeble growth of 03 percent in Q1, following the significant contraction of 43 percent recorded in 2010/2011 Q3 due to the political events in Egypt and the regio. This mainly came on the back of continued weakening in the tourism, manufacturing, and construction sector. In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants over the past year, investment levels remained low in 2011/2012 Q2. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Are. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. Given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks and the uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter.

Armenia,2012-05-06,"Press Release 05.06.2012 Interest rate unchanged, 8 percent In the May 8th of 2012 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. There was 1.3 percent deflation recorded in May of 2012, and the 12-month inflation amounted to 0.5 percent, which is somewhat below the confidence band. The Board admitted that further uncertainties over political solutions to debt problems in Eurozone has led to an abrupt U.S. dollar appreciation versus currencies of Armenia's main trade partners, the European union and Russia in particular. This affected the foreign exchange market of the country as the local currency, the Dram, depreciated versus the U.S. dollar. In the meanwhile, the main commodities and food markets of the world are seeing deflationary environment in the face of risks to slowing rates of global demand. Despite the impact of private spending and fiscal policy on domestic prices now is estimated non-inflationary, the Board reckons that the dram depreciation versus the U.S. dollar in May (which is per se easing of monetary conditions) will be going to put its inflationary impact on prices. Although the 12-month inflation now is 0.5 percent, the 12- month core inflation rests within the confidence band. In consideration of the current situation, the Board decided to withdraw from further easing of monetary conditions through the interest rate. Aimed to reduce interest rate fluctuations in interbank market, the Board made a decision to lessen the spread between Deposit facility rate and Lombard Repo facility rate from 6 pp to 5 pp and gradually lower it to 3 pp by the end of the year. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in the Minutes on Interest Rate due on June 15, 2012. The Central Bank Public Relations."
Poland,2012-05-09,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 9 May 2012 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 8-9 May 2012 The Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points: (cid:131) reference rate to 4.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate to 6.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate to 3.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate to 5.00% on an annual basis. Incoming data signal a stabilisation of economic activity in the global economy at a low level. Stagnation in the euro area is accompanied by moderate growth in the United States. At the same time, economic growth in emerging economies, despite some weakening in China, has slightly accelerated. Global economic growth is being hampered by the ongoing balance sheet adjustments of enterprises and households in some developed countries as well as by high fuel prices. Despite some decline, global inflation remains heightened, still driven by high commodity prices. In April sentiment in international financial markets worsened which contributed to the depreciation of exchange rates of emerging market currencies, including the zloty. Worsening sentiment also led to the decrease in commodity prices in global markets, though those prices remain high. In 2012 Q1. Poland's economic growth probably remained relatively high, although it has slowed down somewhat. Relatively high economic activity seems to be evidenced both by the continuously strong growth in retail sales and by the NBP business survey showing that in 2012 Q1 economic situation of enterprises remained good. Some improvement in expectations of the surveyed enterprises with regard to future business conditions also signals that economic slowdown in subsequent quarters could be limited. At the same time, a slowdown in economic activity is indicated by some other business indicators and weaker growth of industrial and construction output. In March, the unemployment rate remained elevated and growth of employment in enterprises stayed low. At the same time, wage growth in the enterprise sector was still moderate. Lending to enterprises continued to rise fast, while growth in lending to households weakened, which was driven by ongoing decline in consumer loans and a further slowdown of mortgage lending. In March, the annual CPI inflation decreased to 3.9%, remaining markedly above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. A slight decrease was also noted in core inflation. At the same time, households' inflation expectations remained high. In the opinion of the Council, in the coming months inflation is likely to stay above the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target. Elevated inflation will be driven by the previously observed weakening of the zloty and high commodity prices. Strong growth in administered 00-919 Warszawa, ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, phone (+4822) 653 28 88, fax (+4822) 653 13 28 prices will also contribute to elevated inflation. The above-mentioned factors may support heightened inflation expectations. The Council assessed that in the medium term the expected economic slowdown will be conducive to lowering inflation. However, since inflation will continue to be negatively affected by factors beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, the expected slowdown may be insufficient to allow inflation to return to the target in the medium term. The risk of inflation remaining elevated is also heightened by the persistence of relatively high inflation expectations. The Council assessed that containing the risk of inflation remaining above the target in the medium term requires an increase of the NBP's interest rates. The incoming data will enable an assessment whether another adjustment of interest rates will be justified."
South Korea,2012-05-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers some economic indicators in the US to have sustained their trends of improvement, but economic activities in the euro area to have remained sluggish. Growth in emerging market economies has continued to exhibit signs of weakening, due mostly to slowing exports. Going forward the Committee expects the global economy to sustain its recovery, albeit at a moderate pace, and judges that risk factors still exist―including the resurgence of sovereign debt problems in Europe stemming from the heightening of political uncertainty, the deepening economic slowdown there, and the geopolitical risks in the Middle East. In Korea, the Committee appraises the recovery of economic growth to have faltered, with consumption and investment decreasing while exports maintain generally sound levels. On the employment front, the uptrend in the number of persons employed is being sustained, led by the private sector. The Committee anticipates that the domestic economic growth rate will gradually return to its long-term trend going forward, although downside risks remain due mostly to the impacts of external risk factors. Consumer price inflation fell to 2.5% in April, and core inflation dropped compared to the previous month as well. The Committee does however recognize the presence of potentially destabilizing factors, such as the ongoing high inflation expectations and the geopolitical risks in the Middle East. In the housing market, the decline in sales prices gathered pace somewhat and the rise in leasehold deposits slowed in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while in the rest of the country both sales and leasehold deposit prices sustained high rates of increase similar to those in the previous month. In the financial markets, stock prices and long-term market interest rates fell and the Korean won depreciated against the US dollar, as price variables fluctuated in line largely with international financial market conditions and economic indicators in major countries. Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and economic risk factors both at home and abroad and endeavoring to lower inflation expectations, will conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the midpoint of the inflation target over a medium-term horizon amid continuing sound growth of the economy."
Russia,2012-05-10,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 10 May 2012 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain the refinancing rate and the interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations unchanged (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations” ). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects. In April inflation remained low in comparison with the target for 2012 — at 3.6% over year ago, while core inflation rate declined to 5.3%. Inflation will rise in the second half of the year as a result of a forthcoming increase in the majority of regulated prices and tariffs as well as a fading disinflationary effect from food prices observed earlier. However, the Bank of Russia expects inflation to be within the target range at the end of 2012. The uncertainty regarding the scale of influence of this factors on inflation expectations remains a significant source of medium-term inflation risks. Industrial capacity utilization rates in March were close to their pre-crisis levels. Production indicators for the first quarter of the year as a whole were fairly strong, while consumer and producer confidence indicators improved. Taking this into account the Bank of Russia does not consider a decline in industrial production in March as indicating higher risks of economic slowdown. The labour market conditions together with strong household credit expansion continue to support robust consumption growth. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, gross output is close to its potential level, which implies an absence of significant demand-pull price pressures. Considering recent domestic and international macroeconomic developments the Bank of Russia judges that the current level of money market interest rates is appropriate for the coming months. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks and in making monetary policy decisions will rely on medium-term economic growth prospects, inflation forecasts and the dynamics of inflation expectations. The next meeting of the Board of Directors on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the first half of June 2012. Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations (% p.a.).

Malaysia,2012-05-11,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. While the global economy continues to recover, developments in the most recent period have increased the risks to global growth. Stress in the international financial markets has re-emerged following rising policy uncertainties and renewed concerns over the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area. Economic activity in Europe also continues to be weighed down by the ongoing fiscal consolidation, impaired financial intermediation and weak labour market conditions. In North America, recent economic data have been mixed, indicating uncertainty in the pace of the economic recovery. In Asia, while economic activity continues to be supported by domestic demand, the growth momentum is affected by the slowdown in international trade activity. While the Malaysian economy is affected by the global developments, domestic demand has continued to support growth, driven by firm consumption and investment activity. Looking ahead, this trend is projected to continue. Private consumption is supported by the stable employment conditions, income growth and public sector measures. Investment activity is mainly led by the domestic-oriented industries, the commodity sector and the public sector. Headline inflation is expected to moderate in 2012 with improved domestic supply and stable demand conditions. Upside risks to inflation could emerge, particularly from global supply disruptions and result in higher global prices for energy and commodities. In the MPC's assessment, there remain continued uncertainties emanating from the global economic and financial environment. The MPC will continue to carefully assess these evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy.

Peru,2012-05-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2012 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based, on the one hand, on the fact that inflation's deviation from the target has been mainly due to transitory supply factors and, on the other hand, on the fact that the economy's pace of growth is close to its potential rate of growth. Moreover, inflation expectations for this year are anchored within the target range. Since May, the BCRP has preventively raised the rates of reserve requirements in order to offset the pace of growth of liquidity in a context of acceleration of the dedollarization of deposits, firms' increased indebtedness in dollars, and low interest rates on operations in foreign currency as a result of high international liquidity levels. The Board oversees the forecasts of inflation and its determinants to consider additional adjustments in monetary policy tools. Inflation in April recorded a monthly rate of 0.53 percent, reflecting mainly the rises in the prices of some perishable agricultural products which were affected by climate alterations. As a result of this, the annual rate of inflation declined to 4.08 percent. Moreover, core inflation in April showed a rate of 0.37 percent and thus accumulated a rate of 3.78 percent in the last 12 months. Inflation excluding food and energy registered a rate of 0.32 percent and an annual rate of 2.48 percent. Furthermore, inflation expectations are within the target range. Even though domestic supply shocks are being observed, the impact of these shocks on inflation is expected to reverse more strongly as from mid-2012, after which annual inflation would converge towards the target range. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show that the economy's growth has stabilized around its long-term sustainable level of growth. On the other hand, indicators of global economic activity show that uncertainty about the pace of global economic activity persists. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Monetary Program for June will be approved on the Board's session of June 7, 2012."
Chile,2012-05-17,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 17 May 2012 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). Internationally, the financial and fiscal situation in the Eurozone has deteriorated and uncertainty about its resolution has increased. In global markets, volatility and risk aversion have increased. In the past few months, economic indicators in the United States. China and other emerging economies have been weaker than market consensus. International commodity prices, particularly oil and copper, have continued falling, although their levels remain high. Domestically, economic activity grew faster in the first quarter than had been projected in the last Monetary Policy Report, although without deviating substantially from its trend growth rate. The labor market remains tight. Annual CPI inflation is within the tolerance range, while measures of core inflation stand around 3%. Nominal wages remain strong. Inflation expectations remain close to target over the projection horizon, while short‐run expectations have fallen due mostly to the reduction in international oil prices. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Georgia,2012-05-23,"NBG Lowers Its Policy Rate by 25 Basis Points to 6% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on May 23, 2012 and decided to lower its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) by 25 basis points to 6 percent. According to the existing forecasts the annual inflation is expected to start moderate growth from June, although it will remain below the target both throughout this year and in the beginning of 2013. The annual inflation in April equaled -2.2%, the negative value of the inflation mostly due to the base effect. The economic activity indicators point at moderate growth and there are no risks of economic overheating and demand side inflationary pressures. The GEL nominal exchange rate has appreciated, causing in April, despite low levels of inflation, the real appreciation. Exchange rate appreciation is related to the foreign currency flowing into the country through tourism and foreign investment, which is confirmed by the growth of foreign cash inflows into the banks. The foreign remittances have increased as well, although in the recent months, their growth rates have declined. It should be noted that the increase in foreign currency inflows is not completely reflected in the economic growth, since these inflows are followed by the significant increase in imports. Since the inflation forecast in the medium term is below the target. National Bank of Georgia reduced the Monetary Policy Rate by 25 basis points. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on June 20, 2012."
South Africa,2012-05-24,"Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) the risks posed to the global and domestic economy from the crisis in Europe have intensified. The mounting speculation about a possible Greek exit from the Eurozone has shaken financial markets as the dangers of contagion effects translating into a global crisis escalate. These developments have the potential to further undermine the fragile recovery in the advanced economies, and reinforce the current slowdown seen in some of the major emerging market economies. The global uncertainties impart a downside risk to the domestic economic growth outlook which remains relatively subdued. The turbulence in the financial markets has caused the rand to depreciate, but the associated risk to the inflation outlook is offset to some extent by the lower international oil prices and depends on how sustained the depreciation will be. Inflation is nevertheless expected to remain within the target range over the medium term. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 6,1 per cent in April, up from 6,0 per cent in March. The increase relative to March was mainly due to the 71 cent per litre increase in the petrol price in April, which includes the higher levies that were announced in the budget. The categories of food, housing and utilities, and transport together accounted for 4,2 percentage points of the inflation outcome. Core inflation, as measured by the exclusion of food, petrol and electricity from CPI, increased from 4,4 per cent in March to 4,5 per cent in April. Food price inflation reversed the downward trend observed since December 2011 and increased from 8,9 per cent in March to 9,1 per cent in April. This was in line with expectations, and a resumption in the downward trend is expected in May. Year-on-year producer price inflation moderated further, measuring 8,3 per cent and 7,2 per cent in February and March 2012 respectively. Food inflation continued to decline, particularly at the agricultural level. Agricultural price inflation, which reached a recent peak of 12,9 per cent in October 2011, declined from 4,6 per cent in February 2012 to 4,1 per cent in March. Manufactured food price inflation declined from 10,9 per cent to 9,6 per cent over the same period. The inflation forecast of the Bank is lower over the near term than at the time of the previous meeting of the MPC. Inflation is seen to have peaked in the first quarter of 2012 at 6,1 per cent compared with the previous forecast when a peak of 6,5 per cent in the second quarter was anticipated. Inflation is expected to average 6,0 per cent in the second quarter of 2012 and thereafter to follow a gradually declining trend within the target range. The forecast period has been extended to the end of 2014, and inflation is expected to average 6,0 per cent in 2012, 5,5 per cent in 2013, 5,0 per cent in 2014, and 4,7 per cent in the final quarter of that year. The improved near-term forecast is due to lower-than-expected recent inflation outcomes, which lowered the starting point of the new forecast. The forecast for core inflation continues to show a moderate upward trend in the short to medium term. This measure is expected to peak at an average of 5,5 per cent in the second quarter of 2013, marginally higher than in the previous forecast, before moderating, and averaging 4,5 per cent in the final quarter of 2014. The survey of financial analysts conducted by Reuters in April also indicated an expectation of lower inflation compared with the March survey. Analysts expect inflation to return to within the CPI target range in the final quarter of 2012, and to average 5,5 per cent in the subsequent two years. Global economic prospects continue to cloud the domestic outlook. The stabilising impact of earlier ECB interventions, particularly the Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTRO), appears to be losing momentum, and their positive impact on spreads on some peripheral European country debt proved to be short-lived. These spreads have risen to levels similar to those prevailing before the first LTRO in November. Uncertainties posed by, and the ramifications of, a possible Greek exit from the Eurozone have resulted in heightened risk aversion in financial markets. Volatility is likely to persist unless decisive political decisions are taken, but the fluid political dynamics in the region have increased the unpredictability of policy responses. Growth in the Eurozone remains weak, with a technical recession being avoided because of a stronger-than-expected outcome in Germany. However almost half of the EU countries are experiencing recessions against the backdrop of continued bank deleveraging, banking stress in some countries, fiscal consolidation and high and rising unemployment. The current turmoil in Europe poses a danger to global prospects generally, along with high oil prices. The UK economy is in recession and growth in the US and Japan has also moderated. Although growth in the US is expected to remain positive for the rest of this year, the risks to the outlook come mainly from a possible sharp fiscal adjustment at the beginning of next year. Growth in emerging markets remains positive, but some loss of momentum has been observed. The Chinese PMI declined further in May and downside risks to growth are likely in emerging markets in the event of an unfavourable and disorderly Eurozone outcome. Growth in sub-Saharan Africa continues to be robust, but could be negatively affected by weaker commodity prices. World inflation remains relatively contained despite high international oil prices. Movements in the rand exchange rate continued to be dominated by changing investor sentiment in international financial markets. Since the previous MPC meeting, rand volatility increased and it appreciated to a level of R7,65 against the US dollar before resuming a depreciating trend. The exchange rate was given some impetus by the announcement in April of the possible inclusion of the rand in the Citibank World Global Bond Index. However, renewed concerns about the Eurozone outlook caused the rand to depreciate further, in tandem with the weakening euro, reaching a level of around R8,40 against the US dollar. This was despite net purchases of bonds and equities by non-residents over that period. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, non-residents have been net purchasers of bonds and equities to the value of R16,4bn. Over the same period the rand has depreciated by 9 per cent against the US dollar, by 3 per cent against the euro and by 6,2 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The extent to which the rand depreciation feeds into the inflation outlook depends on the extent and duration of the moves. This in turn is likely to be highly dependent on the timing and nature of the developments in the Eurozone, and therefore a protracted period of exchange rate volatility is possible. In the absence of a speedy resolution to the crisis, the rand is likely to remain at current levels or even weaken further in the event of a disorderly unraveling of the Eurozone crisis. Under such circumstances the unfavourable impact on inflation could be ameliorated to some extent by offsetting movements in international oil prices. However, the exchange rate has reemerged as an upside risk to the inflation outlook. The deteriorating global outlook poses a downside risk to domestic growth. The Bank's central forecast for GDP growth is more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC at 2,9 per cent for 2012, and 3,9 per cent for 2013. Growth is expected to average 4,1 per cent in 2014. The output gap (around 3,5 per cent) is only expected to begin to contract during the course of 2013. However the possible contagion effects from a further slowdown in Europe will impact on domestic growth through the trade channel, imparting a downside risk to this forecast. The Bank's composite leading business cycle indicator has been increasing slowly, consistent with the uncertain economic environment. Recent developments underscore the continued fragile and uneven nature of the recovery. Mining output contracted at a seasonally adjusted rate of 5,5 per cent in the first quarter of this year, a result of strike action, safety-related stoppages and temporary closures for maintenance. Commodity prices are expected to remain under pressure due to global uncertainties. The performance of the manufacturing sector has been more positive, with the physical volume of manufacturing production having increased at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2012, and is therefore expected to make a strong contribution to first quarter GDP growth. However, manufacturing production contracted on both a year-on-year basis (-2,7 per cent) and a month-on-month basis (-4,3 per cent) in March. The Kagiso PMI reflects the slowing momentum in the sector: having increased markedly in February to 57,9, it declined in the subsequent two months, but at 53,7 in April still indicates positive growth in the sector. The utilisation of production capacity in manufacturing increased marginally to 80,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2012 from 80,1 per cent in the previous quarter. The construction sector reflects the hesitant recovery in the economy. While the sectoral growth performance appears to have improved, particularly with respect to civil construction in the first quarter of 2012, the real value of building plans passed declined for the third successive month in March, reversing the recent positive trend. The three-month on three-month decline was 10,2 per cent, while the year-on-year decline was 24,2 per cent. Consumption expenditure by households, which was the main driver of growth in 2011, has shown some signs of moderation. Real retail sales contracted at a quarter-to-quarter rate of 1,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2012, although the year-on-year increase was 6,8 per cent. Nevertheless household consumption expenditure is still expected to contribute positively to real gross domestic expenditure in the first quarter, albeit at a slower rate than the annualised 4,6 per cent measured in the final quarter of 2011. New vehicle sales growth remains positive, although the short-term momentum has slowed notably in recent months. Motor vehicle exports are also being adversely affected by the weakness in the Eurozone economy. The outlook for consumption expenditure will be determined in part by employment and wage settlement trends as well as by credit extension. These developments are likely to underpin expenditure at sustainable levels. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey of Statistics South Africa, the number of people employed increased by 304,000 from the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2012, despite the unemployment rate increasing from 25,0 per cent to 25,2 per cent over the same period. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements was 7,3 per cent in the first quarter of 2012. The outlook for wage growth is likely to be impacted to a significant degree by the outcome of the public sector wage negotiations. Credit extension to the private sector has accelerated recently despite subdued mortgage lending. Twelve-month growth in total loans and advances by banks to the private sector measured 9,2 per cent in March 2012, the highest growth rate since February 2009. This was mainly underpinned by growth in the category of other loans and advances which was driven initially by household sector demand. However, in the first three months of 2012, corporate sector demand has been more significant, possibly reflecting improved business activity. Twelve-month growth in total loans and advances to households measured 6,8 per cent in March. This includes the growth in the largely unsecured general loans to households. Growth in this category moderated to a still high 29,4 per cent, from a peak of 39,3 per cent in June 2011. However, notwithstanding the need to monitor carefully developments with respect to unsecured lending, there are no signs of stress in the banking sector. Impaired advances as a percentage of gross loans and advances have declined steadily from 5,8 per cent in March 2011 to 4,6 per cent in March 2012. International crude oil prices have moderated in recent weeks in line with the deteriorating global outlook and a significant increase in Saudi Arabian production. Having traded at around US$125 per barrel since mid-February, the price of Brent crude oil declined in mid-April to below US$110 per barrel. The domestic petrol price increased by a cumulative 99 cents per litre in April and May. However a sizeable reduction is expected in June, despite partially-offsetting exchange rate movements. Food prices have continued their moderating trend which is expected to continue in the short term notwithstanding the reversal in April that was due to base effects. Domestic maize prices are substantially lower than those prevailing at the beginning of the year and have reverted to trading close to export parity levels. However, global food prices have increased in the first quarter of this year, and although they remain well below the levels reached in 2011, may indicate further food price pressures in the medium term. Administered price increases remain on average in excess of the upper end of the target range and are the main factor keeping upside pressure on inflation. Administered price inflation measured 11,6 per cent in April, and 8,9 per cent when excluding petrol. The main drivers included the 17,3 per cent increase in electricity prices and the 9,0 per cent increase in education costs. Communication costs, by contrast, continued to decline. The greater uncertainty in Europe and associated global financial market turbulence has impacted on the perceived risks to the outlook for both domestic inflation and growth. The Monetary Policy Committee is of the view that these developments pose a downside risk to the hesitant domestic growth prospects. The balance of risks to the inflation outlook is less clear. While the inflation forecast appears to be more favourable, there are renewed upside risks from a possible further weakening of the exchange rate. However, countervailing pressures could come from weaker demand and lower commodity prices, particularly those of oil. On balance the Committee judges these risks to the inflation outlook to be somewhat on the upside. In this highly volatile and uncertain environment the MPC is of the view that it is appropriate to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy stance, given the continued absence of clear signs of excess demand pressures. The MPC has therefore decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,5 per cent per annum. However the Committee will continue to monitor events closely and assess the risks to the outlook on an ongoing basis, and stands ready to act in either direction should it be deemed appropriate."
Israel,2012-05-28,"28.05.2012 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for June 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.9 percent in April, in line with forecasts and in line with the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target. The rise in the CPI was duemainly to increases in housing and energy prices, in particular the increase in electricity prices. The rate of inflation over the previous twelve months has been stable near the center of the inflation target range (1-3 percent) for the last four months; in April the figure was 2.1 percent, and excluding housing and energy, it was 0.1 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Forecasts of the rate of inflation over the next twelve months are based on the average of forecasters' inflation predictions, on expectations calculated from the capital markets (break-even inflation), and on inflation expectations based on over-the-counter CPI futures contracts offered by banks. Forecasts declined this month, primarily after the announcement of the April CPI, and reached 2.2 -2.3 percent, compared with 2.5 percent in the previous month. Inflation expectations for the coming two to three years declined somewhat, and were stable for longer terms. Expectations for terms greater than two years are now 2.4-2.6 percent. Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now, based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, as calculated from the makam yield curve, and the average of forecasters' predictions range from 2.4 percent to 2.6 percent. Most forecasters predict that the Bank of Israel interest rate will remain unchanged for the next three months. Real economic activity:According to indicators of real economic activity that became available this month, as well as National Accounts datafor the first quarter of 2012. GDP continued to grow in the first quarter at a similar rate to that of the second half of 2011, a rate of growth which is consistent with the Bank of Israel's growth forecast for 2012 of 3.1 percent. A preliminary estimate of National Accounts data for the first quarter indicates that GDP grew by 3 percent (in annual terms), compared with growth of 3.2 percent in the previous quarter; business sector product grew by 2.8 percent, compared with 3.5 percent in the previous quarter; private consumption grew by 4.2 percent, compared with 0.2 percent in the previous quarter; fixed capital formation increased by 6.2 percent compared with 6.7 percent in the previous quarter; exports (excluding diamonds) increased 17.7 percent, compared with a decline of 3.9 percent in the previous quarter. (It should be noted that preliminary quarterly National Accounts estimatesare volatile, and are subject to significant revisions.) The Composite State of the Economy Index for April increased 0.2 percent, and the indices for the previous two months were revised downward. The Central Bureau of Statistics survey of business trends indicates some slowdown in the improvementin activity in April. With that, companies' expectations reported in the survey and climate indices derived from it for May and June regarding activity and employment are positive compared with their levels in previous months. The Purchasing Managers Index increased again in April, following its increase in the previous month. The Research Department's index based on Google searches, which serves as an indicator of demand in the economy in thecoming months predicts an acceleration in trade and services revenue, compared with previous months. Gross VAT receipts indicate some stabilization of activity in April compared with the previous month. The slowdown in activity is reflected especially in declines of goods exports and goods imports in April, continuing their decline in previous months. Nonetheless, services exports and imports of services and raw materials have increased since the beginning of the year at relatively high rates compared with the final quarter of 2011. The labor market: Labour Force Survey data, calculated using the new method, indicate stability for the month of March and for the first quarter of 2012. The unemployment rate increased to 6.9 percent in March, compared with 6.5 percent in February. However, the increase in the unemployment rate in March reflects an increase of 0.8 percentage points in the participation rate, to 63 percent, with an increase in the employment rate to 58.7 percent in March, up from 58.1 percent in February. The Survey's quarterly figures indicate a decline in the unemployment rate, from 6.8 percent in the final quarter of 2011 to 6.7 percent in the first quarter of this year,with increases in the participation and employment rates. According to thesurvey of business trends, and the forecast derived from the data for the number of employees, a recovery in employee recruitment is expected in the coming months. Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of total wage payments, were 6.5 percent higher in April in nominal terms than in April 2011 (excluding the effect of legislative changes); in contrast. March receipts were 5.3 percent higher than in March 2011. Nominal wages increased 0.3 percent in December-February compared with the preceding three months, and real wages declined by 0.6 percent. The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: The Bank of Israel Research Department quarterly staff forecast, which was compiled in March, was not revised, as there were no extraordinary developments regarding the projection. According to the forecast. GDP growth in 2012 will be 3.1 percent, and 3.5 percent in 2013. The forecast projects an inflation rate of 2.6 percent over the four quarters ending in the first quarter of 2013, and an average interest rate in the first quarter of 2013 of 2.5 percent. The interest rate is forecast to begin increasing in the middle of 2013, under the assumption of a recovery in the global economy. Budget data: Actual budget expenditure resulted in a domestic deficit from the beginning of the year through April of NIS 2.8 billion, compared with a surplus of NIS 1.1 billion in the corresponding period of 2011. The deficit from the beginning of the year is about NIS 2.4 billion greaterthan the seasonal path consistent with the Ministry of Finance deficit forecast of 3.4 percent of GDP, but based on forecast growth, revenues over the remainder of the year are expected to be slightly above the seasonal path. The gap so far derives from tax receipts lower than the path and expenditures above the path. The government's commitments for this year (wage agreements, defense expenditure, etc.) are about NIS 6 billion above the budget's expenditure ceiling. It should be noted, however, that the government hasnot in the past deviated from the budget expenditure framework. Hence, anyfurther increase in the deficit is liable to stem from an additional decline in tax receipts. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on April 22, 2012, through May 23, 2012, the shekel depreciated against the dollar by about 2.7 percent, in line with the trend of the exchange rates of most major currencies against the dollar, and strengthenedby 1.5 percent against the euro, which traded mixed against major currencies. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel depreciated by about 0.3 percent. The capital and money markets: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on April 22, 2012, through May 23, 2012, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined sharply by 9.7 percent, in line with the worldwide trend. In the unindexed bond curve, yields declined 10-20 basis points along the entire curve, while there was a flattening of the CPI-indexed bond curve, with a marked increase in rates for short terms. The yield gap between Israeli 10-year government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities widened slightly this month, by 5 basis points (b.p.), to 275 b.p.; this was due to a sharper decline in yields in the US. Makam yields declined along the entire curve, with one year yields declining to 2.41 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS remained essentially unchanged this month at 191 b.p. The Tel-Bond 20 Index and the Tel-Bond 40 Index declined by about 1.3 percent, as part of the negative domestic trend, which was reflected in, among other things, increased yields of holding groups. Tel-Bond yield gaps vis-?-vis government bonds widened this month. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in April, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 4.2 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to oneyear) increased by 10.6 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The outstanding debt of the business sector declined in March by 0.7 percent, to NIS 777 billion. The decline in the debt derived primarily from a decline in outstanding bank credit. Total outstanding credit to households increased in March by 0.7 percent, to NIS 367 billion, but within the total, the balance of outstanding housing credit increased by 0.3 percent, to NIS 261 billion. Total mortgages granted in the twelve months ending in April were 2 percent lower than thoseadvanced in the twelve months to March, continuing the decline from the peak level in May 2011. Unindexed floating rate mortgages granted in April constituted 30 percent of total new mortgages. Interest rates on all mortgagetracks declined this month. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (representing rents) increased in April by 0.8 percent, following its 0.4 percent increase in March. In the past twelve months it increased by 4.6 percent. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased in February-March by 0.3 percent, after an increase of 0.1 percent in January-February. With that, in the twelve months to April, home prices increased at arate of 2.2 percent, compared with a rate of 2.8 percent in the twelve months to March. Activity in the construction industry continues to be strong. There were 44,800 building starts in the twelve months to February, compared with 44,916 in the twelve months to January. In March, the number of homes available for sale built by the private sector increased by 4.7 percent, continuing the trend of increase since the second quarter of 2011, the result of a sharpincrease in building starts since the end of 2009. Thus, the number of homes for sale is still at the levels of 2003-07. The moderation in the rate of increase in home prices in recent months comes against the background of the continued increase in the number of building starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation. These moves, together with land marketing efforts by the Ministry of Construction and Housing and the Israel Land Administration, are expected to continue to have a moderating effect on price increases. The global economy: Uncertainty in Europe increased this month, and as a result concern grew over the state of Europe's financial system andover the additional increase in government bond yields in Europe's distressed debt markets. Macro figures around the world continue to indicate a slowdown, and this month the figures of the large emerging markets were notably poor. Against this background, there were sharp declines in equity markets around the world, and yield spreads widened between distressed debt countries and the US, and particularly between distressed debt countries and Germany. Inflation around the world declined this month too, and commodity prices, particularly oil, declined sharply. Against the background of these developments, there are increasing market assessments that several central banks will take additional easing steps. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate for June 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policythat is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stabilitytarget of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment,growth in Israel, the global economy, monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: Actual inflation over the previous twelve months has been at the center of the inflation target range for the last four months. Inflation expectations calculated from the capital market and those of forecasters declined this month, andat 2.2-2.3 percent are close to the midpoint of the inflation target range. Commodity prices, particularly oil prices, fell sharply, continuing the declines of the past two months. In the first quarter of 2012. GDP grew at a similar rate to that in the second half of 2011--which taken together with other data published this month is consistent with the 3.1 percent Bank of Israel growth forecast for 2012. This month,the uncertainty about future economic developments in Europe intensified. Moreover, macroeconomic data around the world continue to indicate a slowdown in growth, and this month the poor figures of the large emerging economies were particularly notable. Interest rates in the major economies remain low, and markets are not pricing in any increases in interest rates by any of the leading advanced economies' central banks. Against the background of these developments, there are increasingmarket assessments that several central banks will take additional easing steps. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of theincreasing uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on June 11, 2012. The decision regarding the interest rate for June 2012 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. June 25, 2012. 28.05.2012 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for June 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent. The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for June 2012 unchanged at 2.5 percent.

Hungary,2012-05-29,"At its meeting on 29 May 2012, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 7.00%. In the Council's judgement, the near-term prospects of the Hungarian economy are weak, with growth only expected to resume in 2013. The level of output will remain below its potential in the period ahead. Despite subdued domestic demand and the degree of slack in the labour market, the consumer price index is expected to remain elevated over the next few quarters, reflecting the effects of the tax changes and cost shocks. Domestic inflation is likely to rise significantly, driven by increases in VAT and excise duties last year and this year, as well as by the depreciation of the forint exchange rate in the second half of 2011 and the rise in oil prices in early 2012. The government measures, announced as part of the Structural Reform Programme, are expected to directly raise inflation in 2013 while causing aggregate demand to contract, thereby reducing the risk of second-round effects on inflation. However, the development of second-round effects cannot be ruled out due to persistently above-target inflation, and therefore the Council must monitor closely developments in underlying inflation and earnings. The significantly weaker-than-expected preliminary first-quarter GDP data may have reflected in part temporary factors affecting some sectors of the economy and the faster-than-anticipated weakening in recent economic performance. The sharp deterioration in the external environment weakens the short-term outlook for exports. Although there is uncertainty about the expected recovery in Hungary's export markets from the middle of the year, the pick-up in production following the build-up of manufacturing capacities over the past quarters may boost export growth. But domestic demand is likely to fall further in the coming quarters. The uncertain prospects for income growth, continued deleveraging by banks, tight credit conditions and the contractionary effects of fiscal measures on aggregate demand continue to point to subdued investment and household consumption over the period ahead. As a result of the improvement in country-specific factors and the deterioration in global factors, perceptions of the risks associated with the economy have been volatile in the past month. Risk premia demanded by investors for holding Hungarian assets remain high. An escalation of concerns over the sustainability of sovereign debt in some euro-area countries may adversely affect premia on Hungarian financial assets. The Council therefore continues to consider it highly important that an agreement between the Government and the EU and IMF is reached as soon as possible. Meeting the Government's deficit target is essential to achieving an improvement in perceptions about the Hungarian economy. One of the key challenges facing the economy is ensuring the sustainability of government debt, which requires that the country's ability to attract capital and its long-term growth potential be improved. The structure of measures taken to meet the government deficit target is vitally important in this regard. The Monetary Council has decided to leave the base rate unchanged in light of the above considerations. Monetary policy can best contribute to economic growth by maintaining a predictable economic environment, ensuring price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system. The volatile risk environment and inflation running above target for an extended period continue to warrant a cautious policy stance. The Monetary Council will make every effort to ensure that the measures announced by the Government do not contribute to medium-term inflationary pressure and inflation returns to levels consistent with the Bank's medium-term inflation target as the direct effects of the measures wear off."
Turkiye,2012-05-29,"Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand continues as envisaged. While consumption demand shows a significant slowdown in the first quarter, leading indicators suggest a modest recovery for the second quarter. Exports continue to grow at a steady pace. Accordingly, the improvement in the current account balance is expected to continue in the forthcoming period. Although inflation will display a marked drop in May, it is expected to stay significantly above the target until the last quarter of the year. Accordingly, the current tight policy stance will be maintained in the forthcoming period in order to contain risks regarding pricing behavior. The Committee therefore continues to forecast the year-end inflation to be at 6.5 percent stated in the April Inflation Report. The Committee stated that, given the prevailing uncertainties regarding the global economy, it would be appropriate to preserve the flexibility of the monetary policy. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. In this respect, shorter episodes of additional monetary tightening may also be implemented, when necessary. Moreover, in order to support financial stability, the Committee has approved a limited increase in the flexibility regarding the allowance to hold Turkish lira reserve requirements in foreign currency. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Armenia,2012-06-03,"Press Release 06.03.2012 Interest rate unchanged, 8 percent In the March 6th of 20 12 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. There was 0.9 percent deflation recorded in February of 2012, and the 12-mo nth inflation decreased against the previous m onth's indicator by 1.8 pp a nd reached 3.0 percent, which is within the confidence band of 4%±1.5 pp. The Board admitted that internatio nal prices of main raw materials and food pro ducts shaped weak inflation environment in the light of positive trends in economic activity in a number of advanced countries of the world and optimistic expectatio ns about world economic growth outlook. Besides, in the face o f geopolitical issues in the Middle East prices of oil products have grown, which was outlined as a risk in the first quarter of 2012 Monetary Policy Program. The Board nevertheless does not consider these developments worrisome in terms of their influence on the inflation environme nt in Armenia in the upcoming months. The Board accepted th at the impact of dom estic economic developments on inflation environment from the fiscal sector a nd private spending on the one hand and from the labor market on the other hand remains neutral. The Board evaluates that in the current situation there is high likelihood that in the entire forecast time horizon the 12-month inflation will be within the confidence band of 4%±1.5 pp. With current economic develop ment trends, the CBA will continue maintaining the policy rate at the 8 percent level, which will leave a neutral impact on the infl ation environment.

Euroarea,2012-06-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Rehn. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. While inflation rates are likely to stay above 2% for the remainder of 2012, over the policy-relevant horizon we expect price developments to remain in line with price stability. Consistent with this picture, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area economy continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At the same time, economic growth in the euro area remains weak, with heightened uncertainty weighing on confidence and sentiment, giving rise to increased downside risks to the economic outlook. In previous months we have implemented both standard and non-standard monetary policy measures. This combination of measures has supported the transmission of our monetary policy. Today, we have decided to continue conducting our main refinancing operations (MROs) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the 12th maintenance period of 2012 on 15 January 2013. This procedure will also remain in use for the Eurosystem's special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed. The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at the time. Furthermore, the Governing Council has decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to be allotted until the end of 2012 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. Keeping in mind that all our non-standard monetary policy measures are temporary in nature, we will monitor further developments closely and ensure medium-term price stability for the euro area by acting in a firm and timely manner. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. On a quarterly basis, euro area real GDP growth was flat in the first quarter of 2012. Available indicators for the second quarter of the year point to a weakening of growth and highlight prevailing uncertainty. Looking beyond the short term, we continue to expect the euro area economy to recover gradually. However, ongoing tensions in some euro area sovereign debt markets and their impact on credit conditions, the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors and high unemployment are expected to continue to dampen the underlying growth momentum. The June 2012 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between -0.5% and 0.3% for 2012 and between 0.0% and 2.0% for 2013. Compared with the March 2012 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the range for 2012 remains unchanged, while there is a slight narrowing of the range for 2013. In the Governing Council's assessment, the economic outlook for the euro area is subject to increased downside risks relating, in particular, to a further increase in the tensions in several euro area financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to possibly renewed increases in commodity prices over the medium term. Euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.4% in May 2012, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 2.6% in the previous month. Inflation is likely to stay above 2% for the remainder of the year, mainly owing to developments in energy prices and indirect taxes. However, on the basis of current futures prices for commodities, annual inflation rates should fall below 2% again in early 2013. Looking ahead, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain subdued. The June 2012 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 2.3% and 2.5% for 2012 and between 1.0% and 2.2% for 2013. In comparison with the March 2012 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, there is a narrowing of the projection ranges for 2012 and 2013. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as broadly balanced. Upside risks pertain to further increases in indirect taxes, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation, and higher than expected commodity prices over the medium term. The main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area. The monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion remained subdued in the first four months of 2012. The annual growth rate of M3 fell to 2.5% in April, down from 3.1% in March, following strong inflows into money in the first quarter of the year. The moderation in annual M3 growth in April was mainly driven by outflows from overnight deposits belonging to non-monetary financial intermediaries (which includes entities like central counterparties, investment funds and securitisation vehicles). The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) declined to 0.8% in April (from 1.2% in March), owing to negative loan flows to non-monetary financial intermediaries. At the same time, monthly flows of loans to non-financial corporations and households were moderately positive in April and the annual rates of growth (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.7% and 1.5% respectively in April, broadly unchanged from March. Money and credit data up to April provide evidence that, as intended by our policy measures, an abrupt and disorderly adjustment in the balance sheets of credit institutions has not materialised. Given the current cyclical situation and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises, subdued credit demand is likely to prevail in the period ahead. Looking ahead, it is essential for banks to continue to strengthen their resilience further. The soundness of banks' balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. Let me now make a few remarks relating to fiscal and economic policies. Significant progress has been achieved with fiscal consolidation over recent years. It is of crucial importance to continue with the efforts to restore sound fiscal positions and to regain competitiveness. As a natural complement, the implementation of the new macroeconomic surveillance framework under the EU semester is necessary. In several euro area countries, excessive imbalances exist and need to be corrected. To this end, comprehensive product, labour and financial sector reforms will help foster sustainable growth. Competition should be strengthened in product markets, not least by the completion of the Single Market, and wages should adjust in a flexible manner, reflecting labour market conditions and productivity. These growth-enhancing reforms would accelerate the necessary adjustment process and enhance job creation. Finally, the Governing Council very much welcomes leaders at the last European Council meeting agreeing to step up their reflections on the long-term vision for Economic and Monetary Union."
Poland,2012-06-06,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 6 June 2012 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 5-6 June 2012 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate at 4.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 6.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 3.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 5.00% on an annual basis. Incoming data signal a stabilisation of economic activity in the global economy at a low level. Stagnation in the euro area is accompanied by moderate growth in the United States. At the same time, economic activity in the world's largest emerging economies has somewhat weakened. Global inflation, despite some decline, remains heightened. Since the previous meeting of the Council, sentiment in the global financial markets has deteriorated, what was largely driven by rising concerns about the economic situation of some euro area countries. Deteriorated sentiment has led to depreciation of emerging economies' currencies, including the zloty, as well as to decrease of commodity prices in global markets. In Poland. GDP data have confirmed a gradual slowdown in economic growth. In 2012 Q1, stable consumption growth was accompanied by slower  as compared to the previous quarter  investment growth. Growth in Polish exports and imports also slowed down. Monthly data on industrial and construction output as well as on retail sales in April indicate a possible further economic slowdown. According to the Labour Force Survey, the number of working persons in the economy continued to rise in 2012 Q1. In spite of higher number of working persons, unemployment rate increased as compared to a year ago, since the number of economically active persons also grew. At the same time, wage growth in the economy, including in the enterprise sector, picked up somewhat. Acceleration of wages in 2012 Q1 combined with weaker GDP growth resulted in higher ULC growth. Yet, the April's data on enterprises point to weakening employment and wage growth in this sector. In April, lending to enterprises continued to rise, albeit at a slower pace. At the same time, growth in lending to households decelerated further, what was the result of ongoing decline in consumer loans and slower growth in housing loans. The CPI inflation increased to 4.0% in April, remaining markedly above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. Core inflation rose as well. In the opinion of the Council, in the coming months inflation is likely to remain above the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target, driven by high growth in administered prices, as well as weaker zloty exchange rate as compared to the previous year. 00-919 Warszawa, ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, phone (+4822) 653 28 88, fax (+4822) 653 13 28 In the Council's opinion, in the medium term inflation will be curbed by economic slowdown and by the NBP interest rates increases implemented in 2011 and 2012. Incoming data, as well as the NBP's July macroeconomic projection will enable a more comprehensive assessment of the scale of economic slowdown and future inflation developments in Poland, thus allowing for the assessment whether another adjustment of interest rates will be justified."
South Korea,2012-06-08,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the trends of improvement in some economic indicators in the US to have shown signs of faltering, and economic activities in the euro area to have remained sluggish. Growth in emerging market economies has continued its trend of weakening, due mostly to slowing exports. Going forward the Committee expects the global economy to sustain its recovery, albeit at a moderate pace, but judges that the downside risks to growth are becoming larger, due chiefly to the international financial market unrest stemming from euro area risks and to the possibilities of economic slumps in major countries. In Korea, the Committee appraises the trend of economic growth, although weak, to be continuing, with consumption and facilities investment having shifted to slight increases while exports generally maintain their levels of last year. On the employment front, the uptrend in the number of persons employed is being sustained, led by the private sector. The Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will gradually post long-term trend level growth going forward, but recognizes the situation to be one in which downside risks to growth are becoming larger due mostly to the increase in external risk factors. Consumer price inflation sustained a level in the mid-2% range in May, and core inflation dropped compared to the previous month. The Committee does however recognize the presence of potentially destabilizing factors, such as pressures to hike public utility fees and the ongoing high inflation expectations. In the housing market, sales prices have remained weak and leasehold deposits halted their rise in Seoul and its surrounding areas. The uptrends of both sales and leasehold deposit prices in the rest of the country have slowed. In the financial markets, stock prices have declined considerably, long-term market interest rates have also fallen and the Korean won has depreciated greatly against the US dollar, due mostly to the continuation of international financial market unrest and the strengthening of risk aversion tendencies. Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring external risk factors and the consequent changes in domestic financial and economic conditions, and endeavoring to lower inflation expectations, will conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the midpoint of the inflation target over a medium-term horizon amid continuing sound growth of the economy."
Armenia,2012-06-11,"Press Release 06.11.2012 Interest rate unchanged, 8 percent In the November 6th of 2012 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. There was 1.2 percent inflation recorded in September of 2012, and the 12-month inflation increased to 3.4 percent, coming closer to the confidence band. The Board admitted that influences expected from the external sector remain minor inflationary. In spite of further uncertainties over political solutions regarding debt problems in developed countries, global demand is predicted to be weak in the forecast horizon. Yet persistently high prices of wheat point out to existing fundamental tightness in world markets. The latter will continue to have impact on domestic prices, mostly reflecting the prices in the item “bread product”. Driven by geopolitical developments, inflationary risks deriving from energy resources from external sector are possible. The impact of developments in the Armenian economy on domestic prices is predicted to be moderately inflationary in the forecast horizon, which is determined by faster growing rates of private consumption hence higher economic growth. The influence of the aforementioned factors on domestic prices will continue to be offset by contractionary impact of the fiscal policy. In view of the 12-month inflation behavior in the recent months and minor inflationary impact on domestic prices expected from external sector and domestic economy, the Board finds it reasonable to withhold from changing the refinancing rate. In this circumstance, in the upcoming months the 12-month inflation will come closer to the 4 percent target and will stay around that level in the forecast horizon. To minimize interest rate volatility in the interbank market, the Board is in the last phase whereby the spread between the CBA's Deposit Facility and Lombard Facility rates will be narrowed from 4 pp to 3 pp. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in the Minutes on Interest Rate due on November 16 2012.

Philippines,2012-06-13,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy rates at4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also maintained accordingly. The reserve requirement ratios were kept steady as well. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation environment remains manageable. Latest baseline forecasts continue to track the lower half of the 3-5 percent target range for 2012 and 2013, while inflation expectations remain firmly anchored. At the same time, domestic macroeconomic readings have improved significantly in the first quarter. Adequate liquidity and strong bank lending, spurred by prevailing low interest rates, should also help sustain domestic real sector activity in the months ahead. Moreover, the Monetary Board noted that core inflation remains firm. Oil prices continue to show considerable volatility, while additional petitions for electricity rate adjustments could provide an upside influence on inflation. At the same time, the weak global economy can contribute to moderate oil and other commodity prices. As such, inflationary pressures and the risk of second-round effects may also ease in the coming months. On balance, therefore, the Monetary Board believes that the benign inflation outlook and robust domestic growth provide adequate room to keep policy rates unchanged, especially as the cumulative 50-basis-point reduction in policy rates and the operational adjustments in the reserve requirements earlier in the year work their way through the economy. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions to ensure that monetary policy remains in line with price stability while being supportive of economic growth."
Thailand,2012-06-13,"No 30 /2012 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 13 June 2012 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting today as follows. Risks to global economy increased relative to the previous meeting, reflecting heightened uncertainty about the future of Greece in the eurozone and banking problems in Spain. As a result, the contraction of the eurozone economy was projected to be more protracted than previously anticipated. This could have repercussions on the US economic recovery as well as Asia, where export growth has moderated in line with the slowdown in China and the global economy. Nonetheless robust domestic demand and remaining fiscal and monetary policy space would help to cushion the impact of softer global economic growth on the Asian economy. The Thai economy recovered faster than expected in the first quarter. This positive growth momentum was expected to be sustained going forward on the back of accommodative monetary conditions, robust private loan growth, and the implementation of government stimulus measures. However should the eurozone crisis intensify, slower export growth could act as a drag on the economic recovery. Price pressure from production cost moderated following the reduction in oil and commodity prices against the backdrop of a softer global economic outlook. Nonetheless the pass-through of costs to prices of goods and services continued to be sustained by robust domestic demand, while inflation expectation remained elevated in light of the minimum wage hike and the energy price structure reform. Despite easing somewhat, overall inflationary pressure remained. The MPC assessed that the balance of risks for the Thai economy was skewed towards growth rather than inflation, primarily reflecting heightened global economic risks stemming from the large degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic problems in Europe. The MPC deemed it appropriate to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance in order to support a firm recovery of the Thai economy and temper some of the risks coming from the global economy. The MPC therefore voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 300 percent per annum at this meeting and would remain vigilant in monitoring global economic developments and stand ready to take appropriate policy action as warranted."
Chile,2012-06-14,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 14 June 2012 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). Internationally, the financial and fiscal problems in the Eurozone continue to intensify, and uncertainty about their resolution has increased. In global markets, volatility and risk aversion have increased again. Economic indicators in the United States. China and other emerging economies have been weaker than forecast by market consensus. International commodity prices, including copper, oil and foodstuffs, have continued falling, although their levels remain high by historic standards. Domestically, output and demand indicators are evolving at trend rates. The labor market remains tight, although some moderation is observed in the pace of employment growth. Y‐o‐y CPI inflation and core inflation measures are around 3%. In recent months, the most volatile components of the basket show a negative incidence in the CPI, contrasting with their behavior of the first quarter. Inflation expectations remain close to target over the projection horizon. The effects of increased international volatility on the domestic financial markets have been limited. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2012-06-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2012 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based, on the one hand, on the fact that inflation's deviation from the target has been mainly due to transitory supply factors and, on the other hand, on the fact that the economy's pace of growth is close to its potential rate of growth. In addition, uncertainty in international financial markets has increased again, which is reflected in the drop of the international prices of commodities. The Board oversees the forecasts of inflation and its determinants to consider additional adjustments in monetary policy tools. Inflation in May recorded a monthly rate of 0.04 percent, which reflected the lower prices of some perishable agricultural products and the decline of electricity and inter-province transport rates. As a result of this, annual inflation registered a rate of 4.14 percent. Moreover, core inflation in May showed a rate of 0.33 percent and thus accumulated a rate of 3.77 percent in the last 12 months. Inflation excluding food and energy recorded a rate of 0.23 percent and an annual rate of 2.59 percent. The evolution of inflation in May shows that the supply factors that led inflation to rise transitorily above the target range would have started to reverse. Thus, annual inflation is expected to decline in a more sustained manner as from mid-2012, after which inflation would converge towards the target range. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show that the economy's growth has stabilized around its long-term sustainable level of growth. On the other hand, indicators of global economic activity show that uncertainty about the pace of global economic activity has increased. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Monetary Program for July will be approved on the Board's session of July 12, 2012."
Russia,2012-06-15,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 15 June 2012 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain the refinancing rate and the interest rates on the main Bank of Russia operations and to change starting from 18 June 2012 the parameters of the calculation of the swap points for the overnight FX swap transactions: to reduce to 6,50% p.a. the interest rate on the rouble swap leg and to reduce to 0% p.a. the interest rate on the foreign currency swap leg ( table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations” ). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and economic outlook, taking into account the increased global economic uncertainty and it is neutral in terms of monetary policy stance. The cut in the rouble rate on the FX swap transactions will enhance the ability of the credit institutions to obtain rouble liquidity from the Bank of Russia which should contribute to restraining money market interest rates volatility and strengthening of the interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Inflation remained low in comparison with the target for 2012, amounting to 3.7% over year ago as of 9 of June. Core inflation rate declined to 5.3% in May. The planned increase in the majority of regulated prices and tariffs in July as well as a fading disinflationary effect from food prices will result in the consumer prices growth in the second half of the year, thus contributing to the return of the inflation back to the target range for 2012. The uncertainty regarding the scale of influence of these factors on inflation expectations as well as the elevated volatility of the global FX market remain a source of medium-term inflation risks. The decline in the industrial production growth rate in year-over-year terms in April was primarily attributed to the decline in particular components of the index due to weather-related factors and does not indicate higher risks of economic slowdown. Some moderation in retail sales growth has been observed in the recent months, still the labour market conditions together with household credit expansion continue to support robust domestic demand. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, gross output is close to its potential level, which implies an absence of significant demand-pull price pressures. Considering recent domestic and international macroeconomic developments the Bank of Russia judges that the current level of money market interest rates is appropriate for the coming months. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks and the influence of the global economic developments, including the possible change in the global commodity market conditions, on the Russian economy. In making monetary policy decisions the Bank of Russia will rely on medium-term inflation goals and the economic outlook, as well as the dynamics of inflation expectations.

India,2012-06-18,"Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: June 2012 Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.75 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities; and keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 9.0 per cent. Introduction 2. Since the Reserve Bank's Annual Policy statement in April, global macroeconomic and financial conditions have deteriorated. At the same time, the domestic macroeconomic situation too raises several deepening concerns. While growth in 2011-12 has moderated significantly, headline inflation remains above levels consistent with sustainable growth. Importantly, retail inflation is also on an uptrend. The Reserve Bank had frontloaded the policy rate reduction in April with a cut of 50 basis points. This decision was based on the premise that the process of fiscal consolidation critical for inflation management would get under way, along with other supply-side initiatives. Our assessment of the current growth-inflation dynamic is that there are several factors responsible for the slowdown in activity, particularly in investment, with the role of interest rates being relatively small. Consequently, further reduction in the policy interest rate at this juncture, rather than supporting growth, could exacerbate inflationary pressures. Global Economy 4. The euro area sovereign debt problem has continued to weigh on the global recovery. After a brief phase of relative calm reflecting the large liquidity injection by the European Central Bank (ECB), renewed concerns have arisen about a sustainable solution to the sovereign debt problem and the increasing vulnerability of the banking sector. Consequently, risk aversion has increased. Recent data suggest that US economic recovery is weakening. Growth in major emerging and developing economies (EDEs) is also moderating. While slowing global growth has dampened commodity prices, heightened risk aversion and the resultant slowing of capital flows will have a significant adverse impact on EDEs, including India. Also, should there be an event shock, central banks in advanced economies will likely do another round2 of quantitative easing. This will have an adverse impact on growth and inflation in EDEs, particularly on oil importing countries such as India, through a possible rebound in commodity prices. Domestic Economy Growth 5. Economic activity in 2011-12 moderated sequentially over the quarters to take growth to a low of 5.3 per cent in Q4, though for the year as a whole it was 6.5 per cent. Deceleration in industrial production from the supply side and weak investment from the demand side have, in particular, contributed to the growth slowdown. The index of industrial production (IIP) increased by just 0.1 per cent in April 2012. Even as the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for May suggested that industrial activity remains in an expansionary mode, there is no question that the pace of expansion has slowed significantly. In this context, it is relevant to assess as to what extent high interest rates are affecting economic growth. Estimates suggest that real effective bank lending interest rates, though positive, remain comparatively lower than the levels seen during the high growth phase of 2003-08. This suggests that factors other than interest rates are contributing more significantly to the growth slowdown. Further, one implication of the rupee depreciation over the past several months is that domestic producers have gained in competitiveness over foreign producers. Over time, this should result in expanding exports and contracting imports, thus acting as a demand stimulus. Inflation 8. During 2011-12, headline WPI inflation rate moderated from a peak of 10.0 per cent in September 2011 to 7.7 per cent in March 2012. However, during 2012-13 so far, provisional data suggest that it inched up from 7.2 per cent in April to 7.6 per cent in May, driven mainly by food and fuel prices. Primary food articles inflation rose from negative [(-) 0.7 per cent)] in January to 10.7 per cent in May largely due to a sharp increase in vegetable prices. Protein inflation continued to be in double digits. With food prices contributing so heavily to headline inflation, the performance of the south-west monsoon will also play a role in determining inflationary conditions over the course of the current year. Though international crude prices have fallen significantly from their levels in April 2012, the rupee depreciation has significantly offset its impact on wholesale prices. Further, even at the current lower level of global crude oil prices, significant under-recoveries persist in respect of administered petroleum product prices. The positive development on the inflation front is that core (non-food manufactured products) inflation has trended down. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation (as measured by the new series, base year 2010) rose from 8.8 per cent in February to 9.4 per cent in March and further to 10.4 per cent in April. Significantly. CPI inflation, excluding food and fuel, was also in double digits suggesting that moderation in wholesale price inflation has not transmitted to the retail level. Notwithstanding the moderation in core inflation, the persistence of overall inflation both at the wholesale and retail levels, in the face of significant growth slowdown, points to serious supply bottlenecks and sticky inflation expectations. Also, in the absence of pass-through from international crude oil prices to domestic prices, the consumption of petroleum products remains strong distorting price3 signals and preventing the much needed adjustment in aggregate demand. The consequent subsidy burden on the Government is crowding out public investment at a time when reviving investment, both public and private, is a critical imperative. The widening current account deficit (CAD), despite the slowdown in growth, is symptomatic of demand-supply imbalances and a pointer to the urgent need to resolve the supply bottlenecks. Liquidity Conditions 12. Although money supply (M ) growth has been slightly under the projected 3 trajectory, credit growth has moved above the projected rate. Notably, the widening wedge between deposit growth and credit growth is intensifying liquidity pressures. However, the open market operations (OMOs) have substantially eased liquidity conditions, as is reflected in the stabilization of the overnight call money rate close to the policy repo rate. To further augment liquidity and encourage banks to increase credit flow to the export sector, the Reserve Bank has increased the limit of export credit refinance from 15 per cent of outstanding export credit of banks to 50 per cent, which will potentially release additionally liquidity of over 300 billion, equivalent to about 50 basis points reduction in the CRR. External sector 13. During 2011-12, the widening CAD, in the face of worsening global economic and financial conditions, exerted downward pressure on the rupee. As capital inflows continue to remain muted, the rupee has further depreciated since April. Prospects for increasing capital inflows depend on both global conditions, particularly a credible resolution of the euro area situation, and an improvement in the domestic investment climate. Guidance 14. The evolving growth-inflation dynamic will continue to influence the Reserve Bank's stance on interest rates. Core inflation has moderated, reflecting demand conditions and lower pricing power. However, both headline and retail inflation rates are rising, which have a bearing on inflation expectations. Future actions will depend on a continuing assessment of external and domestic developments that contribute to lowering inflation risks. Management of liquidity remains a priority. Even as the liquidity situation converges to the comfort zone, the Reserve Bank will continue to use OMOs as and when warranted to contain liquidity pressures. Finally, recognizing that the global situation is turbulent, the Reserve Bank stands ready to use all available instruments and measures to respond rapidly and appropriately to any adverse developments.

Georgia,2012-06-20,"20.06.12 NBG Lowers Its Policy Rate By 25 Basis Points to 5.75% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on June 20, 2012 and decided to lower its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) by 25 basis points to 5.75 percent. The annual inflation in May equaled -3.3%, the negative value of inflation mostly due to the base effect. According to the existing forecasts the annual inflation is expected to start growing in June, although it will remain below the target value both throughout this year and in the beginning of 2013. Georgian economy grew by 6.8% in the first quarter of 2012, with the notable high growth in manufacturing and construction sectors. The economic activity indicators point at an even higher growth in the second quarter. Despite high growth rates the output gap is close to zero, so that there are no demand side inflationary pressures. Since the inflation forecast in the medium term is lower than the target value. National Bank of Georgia reduced the Monetary Policy Rate by 25 basis points. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on July 18, 2012."
Pakistan,2012-06-20,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION June 2012 While managing the external and fiscal pressures remain more of an immediate concern, the real challenge lies in reviving private investment in the economy. Inflationary pressures have not subsided either despite sluggish GDP growth. At the same time, the scheduled banks continue to avoid extending credit to private businesses, which are already suffering from energy shortages. Fiscal authority, on the other hand, is accumulating short term domestic debt at rapid pace. The impact of SBP's monetary policy, in these circumstances, is less effective. The economy basically needs fundamental reforms to engineer turnaround in economic performance. For instance, inflation expectations cannot be effectively anchored around single digit targets without limiting fiscal borrowings from the banking system, particularly the SBP. Borrowing from the banking system has risen substantially during this fiscal year. Rs 1098 billion (Rs707 billion excluding the Rs391 billion related to the partial settlement of circular debt), from 1st July to 25th May. FY12 with borrowing from SBP (on cash basis) expanding by Rs 414 billion during the same period. In fact, the latter has accelerated during 1st April to 4th June, 2012, increasing by Rs310 billion, pushing the outstanding stock to Rs1660 billion (on cash basis). This behaviour contravenes the SBP (Amendment) Act 2012, which requires not only zero quarterly borrowings but also envisages their retirement in the next seven years. Not surprisingly, the year-on-year CPI inflation has increased to 12. percent in May 2012. noteworthy aspect of inflation behaviour is its persistence at this high level alongside slack economic activity. probable explanation of this persistence is that the expansionary effect of the fiscal position is off- setting the weak private demand, especially investment demand. SBP is not expecting sharp increase in inflation but its continuation around current levels in FY13. The issue is not just aggregate demand pressures but also people's expectations. Therefore limiting and retiring budgetary borrowings from the banking system and implementation of consistent and credible policies would help in moving away from this undesirable equilibrium. The sheer volume of borrowing from the banking system and expectations that this trend will continue, in the absence of fiscal reforms, has made banks complacent. They are simply channelling the economy's incremental deposits, raised at percent on average, to government securities that give an average return of approximately 12 percent across different maturities. Specifically the scheduled banks perceive the government as captive borrower and can afford to avoid the private sector without taking hit on their profits. The real issue is the structural gap between fiscal revenues and expenditures of the fiscal authority. This gap cannot be narrowed without fiscal reforms. In particular, it would be difficult to reduce the scale of borrowings from the scheduled banks and adhere to the legal requirements of limiting and retiring borrowings from the SBP without generating additional revenues. Falling private investment to GDP ratio to 12. percent in FY12 according to provisional data, also echo's the need for fiscal reforms. Absence of an enabling business environment due to persistent energy Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN shortages and precarious law and order conditions has dampened the demand for fresh private credit. Therefore urgent energy sector reforms are required to boost business confidence and arrest the declining investment to GDP ratio. As for the developments in the external sector, the issue is not the size of the external current account deficit but lack of sufficient external inflows to finance it. Cushioned by robust worker remittances of $10. billion, the current account deficit was $3. billion during the first ten months of FY12. After incorporating the estimated deficit for the remaining two months, it is likely to remain around. percent of GDP for FY12, which is not large for developing country like Pakistan. The net flows in the capital and financial account, on the other hand, were only $1. billion during the same period. Accounting for repayments of the IMF loans during the year. SBP's net liquid foreign exchange reserves have declined to $11. billion by end-May 2012 compared to $14. billion at end-June 2011. For FY13, the size of the external current account deficit as percent of GDP is projected to be approximately the same as in FY12. However due to anticipated rise in debt payments in FY13, the economy would need substantial external inflows to preserve our foreign exchange reserves. Further the problems in the euro zone have increased uncertainty in the global economy. Being safe haven for investors, the US dollar has strengthened significantly in the past few weeks against almost all currencies, especially the euro, and Pakistan rupee was no exception. Appreciation of the US dollar in international markets is probably one explanation why oil prices have eased somewhat, declining from peak of $130 per barrel (Saudi Arabian Light) on 3rd April 2012 to $97 per barrel on 1st June 2012. This together with expected global slowdown may keep the oil prices softer compared to earlier projections. Given that almost one third of Pakistan's total import bill is due to oil payments, this would be positive development. For instance, with the current quantum of petroleum products and crude imports at 21 million metric ton, decline of $5 per barrel in international oil prices could save up to $700 million in import payments in FY13. After an assessment of the macroeconomic challenges faced by our economy, the Central Board of Directors of SBP has decided to keep its policy rate at 12 percent. Page of."
United States,2012-06-20,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately this year. However, growth in employment has slowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Business fixed investment has continued to advance. Household spending appears to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year. Despite some signs of improvement, the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has declined, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually. Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy. In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. The Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities. Specifically, the Committee intends to purchase Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years at the current pace and to sell or redeem an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less. This continuation of the maturity extension program should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee is prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Dennis P Lockhart; Sandra Pianalto; Jerome H Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Jeremy C Stein; Daniel K Tarullo; John C Williams; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M Lacker, who opposed continuation of the maturity extension program. Statement Regarding Continuation of the Maturity Extension Program."
Turkiye,2012-06-21,"Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand continues as envisaged. While domestic demand shows a significant slowdown in the first quarter, leading indicators suggest a modest recovery for the second quarter. Exports continue to grow despite the weakening global outlook. Overall, aggregate demand conditions support disinflation, and the improvement in the current account balance is expected to continue in the forthcoming period. Energy and unprocessed food prices follow a more favorable course than envisaged in the April Inflation Report, leading to a better inflation outlook. However, pricing behavior should be closely monitored as inflation will continue to stay above the target for some time. Therefore, additional monetary tightening may be implemented along the guidance presented in the April and May Committee meetings. The Committee stated that, given the prevailing uncertainties regarding the global economy, it would be appropriate to preserve the flexibility of the monetary policy. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. Moreover, in order to support financial stability, the Committee has approved an additional increase in the flexibility regarding the allowance to hold Turkish lira reserve requirements in foreign currency and gold. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2012-06-25,"25.06.2012 The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for July 2012 by 0.25 percentage points to 2.25 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Inflation data:The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was unchanged in May, below the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target and below forecasts which were for an increase of 0.2-0.3 percent. The surprise in the CPI was due mainly to the food component, which declinedby 0.4 percent compared with a forecast for a moderate increase. The rate of inflation over the previous twelve months declined to 1.6 percent, belowthe center of the inflation target range (1-3 percent). Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation forecasts, excluding those calculated from the capital markets, declined this month. Inflation expectations calculated from the capital markets (break-even inflation)remained at their level of the past two months, 2.1-2.2 percent. The average of forecasters' projections of the CPI for the next 12 readings declined after the release of the May CPI, from 2.2 percent to 2 percent. Inflation expectations based on over-the-counter CPI futures contracts offered by banks declined this month, particularly after the May CPI was published, from around 2.3 percent to 1.8 percent. Inflation expectations for medium terms declined as well, by 0.2 percentage points, to 2.4 percent. Expectations for longer terms were stable at 2.5 percent. Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate derived from the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market and as calculated from the makam yield curve indicate a 0.25 percentage point decline in the interest rate during the next three months. Most forecasters predict that the Bank of Israel interest rate for July will be reduced by 0.25 percentage points. Real economic activity: Most indicators of real economic activitythat became available this month point to a continuation of growth at a moderate rate of around 3 percent on an annual basis. The second estimate of National Accounts data for the first quarter indicates that GDP grew by 2.9 percent and that business sector product grew by 2.6 percent. Figures for imports and exports were mixed: data on goods exports (excluding ships and aircraft and diamonds) for May indicate a slight decline in exports compared with the previous month, while services exports (seasonally adjusted) increased in April by about 6 percent compared with March, continuing the increase in the first quarter of the year. Goods imports (excluding ships and aircraft and diamonds) increased in May by about 1 percent. Most monthly indicators point to continued growth at a moderate rate: the Composite State of the Economy Index for May increased by 0.2 percent, and the indices for the previous two months were revised upward; the climate indices for May, based on the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, indicate stability in the growth rate of the business sector; and the Consumer Confidence Indicator calculated by the Central Bureau of Statistics increased moderately in May, following its moderate increase in April. The Purchasing Managers Index declined in May by 2.2 points, but for the second consecutive month the index was above 50 points, the boundary between growth and contraction. The Research Department's index based on Google searches, which serves as an indicator of demand in the economy in the coming months indicates a high probability of acceleration in trade and services revenue inJune. The labor market: Labor market data which became available afterthe last monetary policy discussion indicate continued improvement in thisarea. April data from the monthly Labour Force Survey indicate an increasein the participation rate to 63.2 percent and in the employment rate to 59 percent. The unemployment rate in April declined slightly to 6.7 percent. Figures on employee posts for March indicate an acceleration in the trend of increase in employee posts. The forecast for the number of employees, derived from the Business Tendency Survey, is for an increase in employee recruitment in the coming months. Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of total wage payments, were 5.1 percent higher in May in nominal termsthan in May 2011 (excluding the effect of legislative changes); in contrast. April receipts were 6.5 percent higher than in April 2011. Nominal wagesdeclined by 0.1 percent in January-March compared with the preceding three months, and real wages declined by 1.1 percent. The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: The Bank of Israel Research Department updated this month its macroeconomic forecast for 2012 and 2013. (A separate release, presenting the forecast, is published in parallel with this interest rate release.) The forecast for the primary variables was revised downward, though only slightly so. Projected GDP growth in 2012 was unchanged at 3.1 percent. In light of the decline in the global growth forecast, the forecast for 2013 for Israel declined slightly to 3.4 percent from 3.5 percent in the previous forecast. (The Research Department also presented a scenario in which the interest rate remained unchanged. Under this scenario, the forecast was for 3.3 percent growth). According to the staff forecast, the inflation rate over the 4 quarters ending in the second quarter of 2013 is expected to be 2.4 percent. The Research Department forecasts that following the current interest rate reduction, the interest rate will remain unchanged until at least the end of 2013, while the previous forecast projected that the interest rate would begin to increase toward the end of 2013. The current forecast was influenced by the deterioration of the economy in Europe, but at the same time also by domestic data for the first half. The Research Department noted that the main risk to the forecast is a deterioration of the financial crisis in Europe. Budget data: Actual budget expenditure resulted in a domestic deficit from the beginning of the year through May of NIS 2.9 billion, compared with a surplus of NIS 0.7 billion in the corresponding period of 2011. Inaccordance with the revised growth forecast, the deficit in 2012 is projected to be about 3.7 percent of GDP: above the seasonal path consistent with the Ministry of Finance's revised deficit forecast of 3.4 percent of GDP: primarily due to tax receipts below the path expected for January-May. The government's commitments for this year (wage agreements, defense expenditure, etc.) are significantly above the budget's expenditure ceiling. It should be noted, however, that the government has not in the past deviated from the budget expenditure framework. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on May 23, 2012, through June 21, 2012, the shekel depreciated against the dollar by about 1.2 percent, and depreciated by 0.32 percent against the euro, in line with the trend of most currencies against the dollar and euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel depreciated by about 0.87 percent. The capital and money markets:From the previous monetary policy discussion held on May 23, 2012, through June 21, 2012, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by 2.7 percent, in line with the worldwide trend. In the unindexed bond curve, yields declined 20-30 basis points along most of the curve, which steepened. A similar trend was observed on the CPI-indexed bond curve, with declines of 10-20 basis points. The yield gap between Israeli 10-year government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities was stable this month, with a slight decline of 4 basis points, to 271 basis points. Makam yields declined by about 20 basis points along the entire curve, with one year yields at 2.19 percent during the period. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five year CDS spread declined by about 20 basis points this month to 170 basis points, similar to developments in many emerging economies. The Tel-Bond 20 Index declined by about 1.1 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 Index declined by about 1 percent. This waspart of the negative domestic trend, which was reflected in, among other things, a widening in Tel-Bond yield gaps vis-?-vis government bonds and in increased yields of holding groups. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in May, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 2.5 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 6.9 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The outstanding debt of the business sector increased in April by 0.5 percent, to NIS 790 billion. The increase in the debt derived primarily from the increase in the CPI and the depreciation of the shekel. These factors increased the balance of CPI-indexed debt and of foreign currency denominated debt. Company responses to theCentral Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey indicate that companies in nearly all industries sense an easing in the credit constraints theyface, except for the construction and hotels industries, where firms reported that the credit constraint became more severe, although the constraint was reported to be moderate. Total outstanding credit to households increased in April by 0.2 percent, to NIS 368 billion, within which the balance ofoutstanding housing credit was NIS 263 billion. Total mortgages granted in the twelve months ending in May were 1.7 percent lower than those advancedin the twelve months to April, continuing the decline from the peak level in May 2011. Unindexed floating rate mortgages granted in May constituted 28 percent of total new mortgages. Interest rates on indexed mortgage tracksdeclined by 0.1 percent this month on average, and interest rates on unindexed mortgages were unchanged. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (representing rents) increased in May by 0.3 percent. In the twelve months ending in May it increased by 3.8 percent, compared with an increase of 4.6 percent in the twelve months to April. Home prices, which are published in the CentralBureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased in March-April by 1.4 percent, after remaining relatively stable in December-March. In the twelve months to April, home prices increased by 2.2 percent, similar to the rate in the twelve months to March. Activity in the construction industry is strong compared with its levels in the past decade. Although building starts are below the record level of the middle of 2011, they remain high and are expected to continue to be reflected in an increased inventory of homes. There were 43,770 building starts in the twelve months to March, compared with 44,817 in the twelve months toFebruary. In February-April, the stock of vacant homes available for sale remained stable at 20,500, after a trend of increase in the past year. The global economy: There was an additional deterioration in economic developments in Europe this month, along with further signs of a slowdown in the global economy's growth rate. In Europe, purchasing managers indices as well as indices of manufacturing, employment, and sales indicate a slowdown. The unemployment rate in the EU reached a record 11 percent; Spain's unemployment rate of over 24 percent was notably poor. In the US, most economic figures indicate a slowdown, reflected primarily in the labor market and in personal consumption expenditure. The Tech Pulse Index continued to indicate a recovery, and a slight recovery was seen in the real estate market. In the large emerging market economies: China. India, and Brazil: data continued to emerge indicating a marked slowdown in growthrates. Investment houses revised downward their growth forecasts for majoreconomies in the world. Against the background of the crisis in Europe, there was a steep increase this month in yields on Spain's sovereign bonds toover 7 percent. Globally, the inflation environment is expected to remain low in advanced economies, and to continue to moderate in developing economies that are experiencing a marked slowdown in growth. Commodity prices continued to decline this month as well, a trend which was prominent primarilyin oil prices, which declined by about 15 percent. Against the background of these developments, central banks again extended various easing plans. The Fed extended its Operation Twist, in which it sells short term securities and buys long term bonds to replace them, until the end of the year. The Bank of England also reported the implementation of aid programs for the real and financial sectors. The ECB adopted various expansionary measures as well, including a decision on a E 282 AC 100 billion loan to Spain, with the aim of injecting capital into that country's banking system. Likewise, there are expectations for additional significant measures by the EU at the end of the month. Against this background, stock market indices rose around the world and there was a decline in the yield on Spain's sovereign bonds. Interest rate reductions continued in several countries. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to reduce the interest rate for July 2012 by 0.25 percentage points to 2.25 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policy that is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel, the global economy, monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The interest rate reduction will contribute to strengthening the Israeli economy's ability to deal with the impact of potential negative consequences from the global economy. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: Following the May CPI, actual inflation over the previous 12 months is below the center of the inflation target range, and inflationary pressures are not felt. Various inflation expectations for the coming 12 months are around the center of the target range, after inflation expectations of forecasters and those based on over-the-counter CPI futures contracts were revised markedly down. Prices of commodities, particularly oil, declined sharply: a continuation of their declines in the previous two months. Most indicators of real economic activity in Israel which became available this month point to continued moderate growth at an annual rate of 3 percent, a rate similar to that of the first quarter. After the reduction in the interest rate for July, the Research Department staff forecast for GDP growth in 2012 remains 3.1 percent and the forecast for 2013 was revised to 3.4 percent. This month macroeconomic data around the world indicate a further slowdown in growth, and projections of international organizations were revised downward. The level of economic risk in the world due to developments in Europe remained high, and with it the concern of negative effects on the domestic economy. Interest rates in the major economies remain low, and markets are not pricing in any increases in interest rates this year by any of the leading advanced economies' central banks. Several central banks even reduced interest rates this month. Against the background of recent developments, the Fed announced the continuation of its easing plans, and there are increasing market assessments that several central banks will take additional easing steps. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of theincreasing uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on July 9, 2012. The decision regarding the interest rate for August 2012 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. July 23, 2012. 25.06.2012 The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for July 2012 by 0.25 percentage points to 2.25 percent.

Hungary,2012-06-26,"At its meeting on 26 June 2012, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 7.00%. The Monetary Council reviewed the June issue of the MNB's Quarterly Report on Inflation prepared by Bank staff. In the Council's judgement, output is likely to fall this year, with growth only expected to resume in 2013. The level of output will remain below its potential in the period ahead. The consumer price index is expected to remain above the inflation target for a protracted period, reflecting the effects of the tax changes and other administrative measures. Although inflationary pressures from the real economy remain moderate, the increases in VAT and excise duties in early 2012 as well as the measures announced as part of the Structural Reform Programme continue to keep inflation above target. The tax measures directly affecting consumer prices are likely to raise inflation only temporarily. By contrast, the measures leading to increases in production costs for companies are expected to feed through to inflation gradually, and therefore may influence inflation over a longer horizon. But this indirect effect will be offset by falling domestic demand and slack in the labour market. Consequently, the price index is expected to fall back close to the target as the effects of increases in VAT and excise duties as well as the cost shocks wear off. The significantly weaker-than-expected first-quarter GDP data partly reflected transient factors; however, the outlook for economic growth has also deteriorated over the entire forecast period. The sharp slowdown in external demand weakens the outlook for domestic exports and the recovery in Hungary's export markets expected from the end of this year is surrounded by significant risks. However, the pick-up in production following the build-up of manufacturing capacities over the past quarters may mitigate the effect of the slowdown in external demand. Domestic demand is likely to fall further in the coming quarters. Persistently high unemployment, falling real incomes and the uncertain prospects for income growth point to declining household consumption over the period ahead. Investment is likely to remain subdued, reflecting the weak outlook for economic activity, the unpredictable business environment and tight credit conditions. The Government's measures to reduce the deficit are likely to lead to a further contraction in domestic demand. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have been volatile recently. Growing concerns over the sustainability of sovereign debt in some euro-area countries may adversely affect premia on Hungarian financial assets. The Council therefore continues to consider it highly important that an agreement between the Government and the EU and IMF is reached as soon as possible. The Monetary Council has decided to leave the base rate unchanged in light of the above considerations. Monetary policy can best contribute to economic growth by maintaining a predictable economic environment, ensuring price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system. The volatile risk environment and above-target inflation for an extended period continue to warrant a cautious policy stance. The Council will make every effort to ensure that the upward impact on prices of the measures announced by the Government does not have any second-round consequences and inflation returns to levels consistent with the medium-term target, as the direct effect of the measures wears off. The Council will consider a reduction in interest rates if Hungary's risk premium falls persistently and substantially and the outlook for inflation improves."
Romania,2012-06-27,"The NBR will continue to closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by accordingly adjusting its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving price stability in the medium term, as well as financial stability. The annual inflation rate continued to slide, reaching a record low of 1.79 percent in May 2012 from 2.4 percent in March 2012 and 3.14 percent in December 2011. This level, as well as the 3.2 percent projection for end-2012, is in line with the general coordinates of inflation in the euro area. At the same time, annual adjusted CORE 21 inflation hovered around 2.0 percent, while the average growth rate of aggregate prices in the last 12 months was 3.5 percent in May 2012 versus 4.5 percent in March 2012 and 5.8 percent in December 2011. The analysis of macroeconomic indicators suggests the persistence of aggregate demand deficit amid the modest growth of investments and private consumption. The external environment was marked by tensions and volatility, amid the adverse reaction of financial markets to the escalating sovereign debt crisis, the deepening of problems faced by the European banking system and the lingering uncertainties related to the world economic growth outlook. The increased global risk aversion and worsened investor sentiment against the background of a potential adverse impact of the adjustments in the European banking system and the contagion effect via volatile capital flows had a significant influence on the economies in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as on the exchange rates of the currencies in the region, the leu included. On the domestic money market the asymmetry of liquidity distribution was alleviated following the adoption of measures to smooth interbank flows, such as expanding the list of eligible assets accepted as collateral for open market operations. The persistent uncertainties, especially as regards the financing possibilities of Romanian foreign-owned credit institutions from their parent banks, generate further tensions in the functioning of the interbank money market and increasing resort to the NBR's refinancing operations. The monetary analysis underlines, however, a moderate upward trend of credit to the private sector, faster in the case of loans to non-financial corporations, as well as a gradual reduction of lending rates on new business to this sector, along with some changes in lending standards. These developments reflect the transmission, with a certain lag, of the previous months' monetary policy signals, a process that might continue in the case of lending rates for the private sector, where there is still room for further adjustments. The current assessment shows the annual inflation rate remaining inside the variation band around the central target throughout the forecast horizon, although reverting to higher readings than the recent historical lows on account of the unfavourable statistical base effect anticipated to become temporarily manifest in the latter half of 2012. Consequently, in the period ahead, it is of utmost importance to permanently adjust broad monetary conditions to the domestic and international macroeconomic context in a bid to consolidate the prospects of maintaining the annual inflation rate within the variation band around the medium-term targets. The uncertain external environment may lead to an abrupt heightening of risks associated with increased capital flow and exchange rate volatility, which, coupled with domestic developments related to the electoral context, calls for a further prudent monetary policy stance in order to efficiently anchor expectations and ensure both price and financial stability. Therefore, the NBR Board has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 5.25 percent per annum, to ensure the adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu-denominated and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR is restating that the implementation of a balanced macroeconomic policy mix amid the fulfilment of commitments under the external financial arrangements with the European Union, the IMF and other financial institutions is essential to achieving price stability in the medium term as well as consolidating financial stability, both being prerequisites for lasting and sustainable economic growth. The NBR Board reaffirms that it will continue to closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by accordingly adjusting its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of the central bank's objectives. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for August 2, 2012, when the new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1Calculated by the NBR by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index.

Czech Republic,2012-06-28,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 4th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 28 June 2012 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided by a majority vote to lower the CNB two-week repo rate by 0.25 percentage point to 0.50%, effective 29 June 2012. At the same time it decided to lower the Lombard rate by the same amount to 1.50%. Four members voted in favour of this decision, and three members voted for leaving interest rates unchanged. Reasons for the decision Headline inflation will be close to its current elevated level as a result of a VAT increase. Monetary-policy relevant inflation will be significantly lower than headline inflation throughout 2012 owing to the tax change. Both headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation will fall slightly below the target in 2013. Consistent with the forecast is a decline in market interest rates in the remainder of this year followed by a rise in rates as from 2013 H2. The risks to the forecast are for higher headline inflation and lower monetary-policy relevant inflation, amid a lower outlook for interest rates in line with the fiscal alternative scenario. Developments in industrial production, construction output and retail sales in April indicate persistent weakness in economic activity. The labour market reacts to the onset of the economic slump with the usual time lag, so its recovery has stopped: Overall employment saw only negligible y-o-y growth in 2012 Q1, the s.a. general unemployment rate moderately increased in q-o-q terms, whereas the s.a. registered unemployment rate has been broadly flat in 2012 Q2 so far. Due mainly to extraordinary factors, annual growth in the average nominal wage markedly accelerated in 2012 Q1. The impact of external cost-push pressures on domestic inflation is fading.

Armenia,2012-07-02,"Press Release 07.02.2012 Interest rate unchanged, 8 percent In the February 7, 2011 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. In January of 2012 inflation was 3.6 percent, and the 12-month inflation against the previous month's indicator increased by 0.1 pp and reached 4.8 percent, which is within the confidence band of 4%±1.5 pp. The Board admitted that inflationary pressures on the Armenian economy from external environment are not expected in the coming period of time, as was outlined in the baseline scenario in the new Monetary Policy Program of the first quarter of 2012. Despite existing uncertainties over the world economic growth, a number of advanced economies recorded some positive signs of economic activity as well as a slight increase of international prices of raw materials and food products. According to the baseline scenario for the Armenian economy, developments maintain a neutral impact on the inflation environment, coming from both the fiscal policy and private spending and the labor market The Board summed up that the progress of the Armenian economy is congruent with the baseline scenario presented in monetary policy programs. Under this development perspective it is expected that the 12-month inflation will be in the confidence band of 4%±1.5 pp during the entire forecast time horizon. Under current trends of economic development the CBA will maintain the 8 percent level of the policy rate which will leave a neutral impact on the inflation environment. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in the Minutes on Interest Rate due on February 17, 2012. The Central Bank Public Relations."
Poland,2012-07-04,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 4 July 2012 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 3-4 July 2012 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: (cid:131) reference rate at 4.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 6.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 3.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 5.00% on an annual basis. Incoming data suggest weakening activity in the global economy. Stagnation in the euro area is accompanied by moderate growth in the United States. At the same time, economic activity in the major emerging economies is deteriorating. Weakening growth in the global economy contributes to falling commodity prices. Deceleration in growth of energy prices, and  in some countries  also food prices, is conducive to the decline in global inflation. Despite persisting uncertainty about the situation in the euro area, the sentiment in the international financial markets has stabilized in the recent weeks. This contributed to appreciation of most emerging economies' currencies, including the zloty. In Poland, data on output and retail sales in May were better than expected. However, the total growth in output and sales in the first months of Q2 decelerated as compared to the previous quarter, which, amidst leading business indicators persisting at relatively low levels, confirms further gradual slowdown in economic growth. In May employment growth in the corporate sector remained weak and the unemployment rate persisted at elevated level. Wage growth in the corporate sector was still moderate. At the same time, growth in lending to enterprises weakened somewhat. Lending to households decelerated further, driven by a decline in consumer loans and lower growth of housing loans. In May. CPI inflation fell to 3.6%, remaining above the NBP's inflation target (2.5%). Decline was also noted in core inflation and inflation expectations of households and corporates. The Council got acquainted with the inflation and GDP projection prepared by the Economic Institute of the NBP, being one of the inputs to the Council's decisions on the NBP interest rates. The July inflation and GDP projection implies that GDP growth in 2013 will fall below its 2012 level and then accelerate in 2014. At the same time, inflation, after a temporary rise in 2012 Q3, will be gradually declining and will be close to the inflation target in 2013. In line with the July projection based on the NECMOD model  prepared under the assumption of constant NBP interest rates  there is a 50-percent probability of inflation falling within the range of 3.6-4.2% in 2012 (as compared to 3.6-4.5% in the March projection), 2.0-3.4% in 2013 (as compared to 2.2-3.6%) and 1.0-2.7% in 2014 (as compared to 1.2-3.0%). In the opinion of the Council, in the coming months inflation is likely to increase temporarily and remain above the upper limit of deviations from the inflation target. However, in the medium- term, economic slowdown amidst fiscal tightening and interest rates increases implemented in 2011 and 2012 will be conducive to inflation returning to the target. This assessment is also supported by the July projection of inflation and GDP. Therefore, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council does not rule out the possibility of further monetary policy adjustment, should the outlook for inflation returning to the target deteriorate. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  July 2012."
Euroarea,2012-07-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Rehn. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to cut the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Inflationary pressure over the policy-relevant horizon has been dampened further as some of the previously identified downside risks to the euro area growth outlook have materialised. Consistent with this picture, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area economy continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At the same time, economic growth in the euro area continues to remain weak, with heightened uncertainty weighing on confidence and sentiment. We have implemented both standard and non-standard monetary policy measures. This combination of measures has supported the transmission of our monetary policy. All our non-standard monetary policy measures are temporary in nature and we maintain our full capacity to ensure medium-term price stability by acting in a firm and timely manner. Let me also remind you of the decision taken by the Governing Council on 22 June 2012 concerning further measures to increase collateral availability for counterparties. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. On a quarterly basis, euro area real GDP growth was flat in the first quarter of 2012, following a decline of 0.3% in the previous quarter. Indicators for the second quarter of 2012 point to a renewed weakening of economic growth and heightened uncertainty. Looking beyond the short term we expect the euro area economy to recover gradually, although with momentum dampened by a number of factors. In particular, tensions in some euro area sovereign debt markets and their impact on credit conditions, the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors and high unemployment are expected to weigh on the underlying growth momentum. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. They relate, in particular, to a renewed increase in the tensions in several euro area financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to possibly renewed increases in energy prices over the medium term. Euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.4% in June 2012, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, unchanged from the previous month. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates should decline further in the course of 2012 and be again below 2% in 2013. Over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain moderate. Taking into account today's decisions, risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be broadly balanced over the medium term. The main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area. Upside risks pertain to further increases in indirect taxes, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation, and higher than expected energy prices over the medium term. Turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained subdued, with short-term developments displaying some volatility. The increase in the annual growth rate of M3 to 2.9% in May, up from 2.5% in April and close to the 3.0% observed in March, mainly reflected a reversal of the outflows in April from overnight deposits belonging to non-monetary financial intermediaries (particularly investment funds). In addition to an increased preference for deposits with shorter maturities, these factors have also shaped M1 developments, with the annual growth rate increasing from 1.8% in April to 3.3% in May. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) declined to 0.4% in May (from 0.8% in April). Annual growth rates for loans to both non-financial corporations and households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) also decreased in May, to 0.2% and 1.3% respectively, with negative monthly loan flows to non-financial corporations. To a large extent, subdued loan growth reflects the current cyclical situation, heightened risk aversion, and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises which weigh on credit demand. Looking ahead, it is essential for banks to continue to strengthen their resilience where it is needed. The soundness of banks' balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels. To sum up, taking into account today's decisions, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. We welcome the European Council conclusions of 29 June 2012 to take action to address financial market tensions, restore confidence and revive growth. We agree that Economic and Monetary Union needs to be put on a more solid basis for the future and that sustainable growth, sound public finances and structural reforms to boost competitiveness remain key economic priorities. We welcome the decision to develop a specific and time-bound road map for the achievement of a genuine Economic and Monetary Union. We also welcome the euro area summit initiative towards a single supervisory mechanism, the possibility  with appropriate conditionality  to recapitalise banks directly, and the use of existing EFSF/ESM instruments in a flexible and efficient manner in order to stabilise markets. Finally, the ECB is ready to serve as an agent to the EFSF/ESM in conducting market operations."
Malaysia,2012-07-05,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The pace of the global recovery has moderated in the recent months. The latest data pointed to slower economic activity and more challenging growth prospects in several regions around the world. Although pressures in the international financial markets have receded following the recent policy announcements to address the European crisis, a number of important policy issues remain unresolved and continue to unsettle financial markets. Economic activity in several of the advanced economies continues to be affected by ongoing fiscal consolidation, impaired financial intermediation and weak labour market conditions. In emerging economies, while domestic demand remains an important source of growth, exports are affected by weak external demand. In the domestic economy, recent data and surveys of business conditions suggest that consumption and investment activity remains resilient. Looking ahead, domestic demand will continue to be the anchor of growth. Household spending continues to be supported by stable employment conditions and income growth. The strong investment activity is mainly led by the domestic-oriented industries, the oil and gas sector and the steady progress in the construction of infrastructure projects. Headline inflation is expected to remain moderate for the remainder of 2012. With some excess capacity in the economy, the strength of domestic demand is not expected to result in inflationary conditions. Global energy and commodity prices are likely to be contained given the weak global conditions. However, upside risks to inflation could emerge should disruptions to global supply result in higher global prices for these commodities. In the MPC's assessment, there continues to be considerable uncertainties in the global economic and financial environment. The MPC will continue to carefully assess these evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy.

Armenia,2012-07-08,"Press Release 07.08.2012 Interest rate unchanged, 8 percent In the August 7th of 2012 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. There was 1.5 percent deflation recorded in July of 2012, and the 12-month inflation amounted to 2.3 percent, approaching the lower border of the confidence band. The Board admitted that minor inflationary and stabilization trends are expected in the main commodities markets amid slowly recovering world demand. However, anticipation of an inflationary environment in world wheat markets due to dry weather in Russia. Kazakhstan and USA is a risk which can be essential in terms of expansion of the inflation environment in Armenia. Further developments in the Armenian economy are estimated to be slightly inflationary, which is determined by faster growing rates of private consumption driven by currently lower inflationary environment and persisted high growth in economy lending. Moreover, private consumption will possibly be growing farther in the upcoming months, pushing aggregate demand up and creating a potential for inflation. In anticipation of inflation rising from a low level as prices of agricultural products drop notably in the second quarter of 2012, as well as in view of the above risks to expanding of inflation environment, the Board decided to withhold from changing the Refinancing Rate. Under such circumstance, in the one-year horizon the 12-month inflation will be within the confidence band of 4% +/- 1.5 pp. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in the Minutes on Interest Rate due on August 17, 2012.

Chile,2012-07-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 12 July 2012 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). Internationally, recent announcements in the Eurozone were welcome, although fiscal risks are still significant and financial markets remain highly volatile. Economic indicators in the United States, the Eurozone. China and other emerging economies have been weaker than forecasted by market consensus. The central banks of several economies—developed and emerging—have adopted more expansionary monetary policies. International commodity prices are at similar levels to those of a month ago, with the exception of grains, which have increased. Domestically, output and demand indicators, despite decelerating less than expected, are evolving at trend rates. The labor market remains tight, although some moderation is observed in the pace of employment growth. Y‐o‐y CPI inflation has fallen and, together with core inflation measures, stands now at less than 3%. In recent months, the most volatile components of the basket (i.e., energy and foodstuffs) show a negative incidence on the CPI, contrasting with their behavior of the first quarter. Medium-term inflation expectations remain around the target. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2012-07-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 3.25% to 3.00%. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 3.25% to 3.00%. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers some economic indicators in the US to have shown signs of deteriorating, and the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have deepened. Growth in emerging market countries as well has continued to slow, mostly on sluggish exports. Going forward the Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be more moderate than originally forecast, and judges the downside risks to growth to be intensifying further, due chiefly to the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the euro area fiscal crisis and to the possibilities of international financial market unrest and economic slumps in major countries. In Korea, the Committee appraises the trend of economic growth to have weakened more than originally anticipated, with the rates of growth in exports and domestic demand remaining at low levels. On the employment front, the uptrend in the number of persons employed is being sustained, led by the higher age groups and the service industry. The Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will sustain a negative output gap for a considerable time going forward, due mostly to the increase in euro area risks and the sluggish economies of its major trading partners. Consumer price inflation fell to 2.2% in June, and core inflation also dropped slightly. The Committee forecasts that inflation will remain below the midpoint of the inflation target for the time being, despite pressures to hike public utility fees for instance. In the housing market, sales prices remained weak and leasehold deposits maintained their levels of the previous month in Seoul and its surrounding areas. The uptrends of both sales and leasehold deposit prices in the rest of the country slowed. 1 In the financial markets, the Korean won has appreciated substantially against the US dollar with the easing of international financial market unrest, while stock prices and long-term market interest rates have fallen slightly, affected for instance by receding expectations of economic recovery at home and abroad. Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring external risk factors and the consequent changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and also continuing its efforts to lower inflation expectations, will conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the midpoint of the inflation target over a medium-term horizon amid continuing sound growth of the economy."
Russia,2012-07-13,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 13 July 2012 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain the refinancing rate and the interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations unchanged (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects, taking into account the global economic uncertainty. In July inflation returned to the target range for 2012: as of 9 of July the pace of inflation was estimated at 5.0% over a year ago. Core inflation in June registered a minor change and amounted to 5.2%. Higher pace of inflation was attributed to the planned increase in the majority of regulated prices and tariffs as well as the accelerated growth of the food prices. The latter, combined with the uncertainty regarding crop prospects this year, became a source of additional inflation risks. Still, according to the Bank of Russia estimates, gross output remains close to its potential level, which implies an absence of significant demand-pull price pressures. Retail sales growth rate remains high; labour market conditions together with household credit expansion continue to support robust domestic demand. The industrial production growth rate recovers and the investment activity shows positive dynamics. Considering recent domestic and international macroeconomic developments the Bank of Russia judges that the current level of money market interest rates is appropriate for the near future. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks and the influence of global economic developments on the Russian economy. In making monetary policy decisions the Bank of Russia will rely on medium-term inflation goals and economic growth prospects, as well as the dynamics of inflation expectations. The next meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the first decade of August 2012.

Peru,2012-07-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2012 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based, on the one hand, on the fact that inflation's deviation from the target has reflected mainly transitory supply factors and, on the other hand, on the fact that the economy's pace of growth is close to its potential rate of growth. Moreover, high uncertainty is still observed in international financial markets and is being reflected in the decline of terms of trade and in prospects of lower growth in both developed and emerging countries. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider additional adjustments in monetary policy tools. Inflation in June showed a monthly rate of -0.04 percent, as a result of which inflation in the last 12 months declined from 4.14 percent in May to 4.00 percent in June. Core inflation recorded a rate of 0.20 percent in June and thus accumulated a rate of 3.64 percent in the last 12 months. Inflation excluding food and energy registered a rate of 0.13 percent and an annual rate of 2.46 percent. The evolution of inflation in June shows that the supply factors that led inflation to rise transitorily above the target range continue to reverse. Annual inflation is therefore expected to decline in a sustained manner in the rest of the year, with inflation converging to the target range. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show that the economy's growth has stabilized around its long-term sustainable level of growth, although the indicators associated with the external market register a weak performance. On the other hand, indicators of global economic activity show that uncertainty about the pace of global economic activity has increased. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Monetary Program for July will be approved on the Board's session of August 9, 2012."
Georgia,2012-07-18,"18.07.12 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate unchanged at 5.75% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on July 18, 2012 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 5.75 percent. According to the existing forecasts the inflation is expected to continue moderate growth and will achieve its target value in the second half of the next year. The annual inflation in June equaled -0.2%. The economic activity indicators point at a high growth in the first half of the year, although the output gap is still close to zero, meaning that there are no risks of overheating and demand side inflationary pressure. Given that the inflation is predicted to achieve the target in the medium term and that the GDP is at its potential value the National Bank of Georgia decided to keep the Monetary Policy Rate unchanged. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on August 29, 2012."
Turkiye,2012-07-19,"Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand continues as envisaged. Domestic demand displays a modest recovery as expected, while exports continue to grow despite the weakening global outlook. Overall, aggregate demand conditions support disinflation and current account balance continues to improve gradually. The Committee has indicated that the year-end inflation forecast is likely to be revised slightly downwards due to recent favorable developments in factors affecting inflation. However, pricing behavior should be closely monitored as inflation will continue to stay above the target for some time. Also considering the prevailing uncertainties regarding the global economy, the Committee has stated that it would be appropriate to preserve the flexibility of the monetary policy. The impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. Moreover, in order to support financial stability, the Committee has approved an additional increase in the allowance to hold Turkish lira reserve requirements in foreign currency. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2012-07-19,"Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee there have been further indications of a generalised slowdown in the global economy, amid the continuing risks posed by the banking and sovereign debt crises in the Eurozone. This negative outlook has contributed to renewed monetary policy easing in a number of countries, including in emerging market economies, in an environment of declining commodity prices and subdued global inflation. Domestic inflation has continued its downward trend, and is expected to remain within the target range over the forecast period. However, despite some moderate employment creation over the past year, the economic growth outlook appears to be threatened by global developments and deteriorating domestic business and consumer confidence. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 5,5 per cent in June 2012, down from 5,7 per cent in May. The categories of food, housing and utilities, and transport together accounted for 3,5 percentage points of the inflation outcome. Food prices increased by 6,0 per cent, petrol by 14,2 per cent and electricity by 17,1 per cent on a year-on-year basis. Core inflation, as measured by the exclusion of food, petrol and electricity from CPI, increased in line with expectations from 4,4 per cent in May to 4,6 per cent in June. Administered prices excluding petrol increased at a year-on-year rate of 8,7 per cent in both May and June. Year-on-year producer price inflation moderated further, measuring 6,6 per cent in both April and May 2012, its lowest rate of increase since April 2011. More than half of this outcome was accounted for by mining and quarrying and electricity price increases. Food price inflation continued its downward trend with agricultural prices increasing at a year-on-year rate of 1,7 per cent in May, while manufactured food prices increased by 8,4 per cent. The inflation forecast of the Bank has been revised downwards since the previous meeting of the MPC, apart from the final quarter of 2014 when a slightly higher outcome is forecast. With inflation expected to have peaked at an average of 6,1 per cent in the first quarter of 2012, it is now expected to continue to moderate over the next few quarters, reaching a low of 4,9 per cent in the second quarter of 2013. Inflation is then expected to remain fairly stable around the 5 per cent level to the end of 2014. Inflation is expected to average 5,6 per cent in 2012, and 5,1 per cent in both 2013 and 2014. The improved forecast is mainly due to lower-than-expected recent inflation outcomes. The forecast for core inflation is also more favourable although the upward trend is expected to continue in the short term. Core inflation is expected to measure 5,4 per cent in the final quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 before declining, and averaging 4,8 per cent in 2014. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University in the second quarter of 2012 were almost unchanged since the previous quarter and remain anchored at around the upper end of the target range. On average, respondents expect inflation to average 6,1 per cent in 2012 and 6,0 per cent and 6,1 per cent in the next two years respectively. The break-even inflation rates declined across all maturities since the previous meeting of the MPC to within the target range. The outlook for the global economy has worsened somewhat since the previous meeting of the MPC, with mounting evidence of a broad-based global slowdown. Negative indicators include a fall in the global manufacturing PMI to its lowest level in three years. The lack of meaningful progress towards a resolution of the Eurozone crisis continues to be a source of global instability and risk, despite initiatives to stabilise the banking sector. The growth outlook for the region remains negative, as fiscal austerity measures and bank deleveraging continue to impact adversely on growth and on unemployment rates that have reached new euro-era highs. In the first quarter of 2012, most of the Eurozone members recorded negative or marginally positive growth, particularly those in the periphery. The UK economy is currently also experiencing a recession. The US economy slowed in the second quarter and the outlook has deterioriated. Concerns relating to the so-called fiscal cliff (the possible sharp contraction of fiscal policy in 2013) are beginning to weigh on consumption and investment decisions, and these pressures are expected to intensify during the second half of this year. Any resolution of this issue seems unlikely before the end of 2012. Spill-over effects have also been felt in emerging markets. China recorded a growth rate of 7,6 per cent in the second quarter of 2012, the slowest since early 2009, amid a property market downturn and weak exports. It is still unclear if the policy responses of the Chinese authorities will be sufficient to contain this trend. Materially slower growth has also been recorded in India and Brazil. In response to these developments, monetary policy has been eased in a number of both advanced and emerging market countries. In the UK, the Bank of England increased the size of its asset purchase programme, and although the Federal Open Market Committee has not resumed its programme of quantitative easing, the maturity extension programme has been extended and monetary policy is expected to remain highly accommodative for a prolonged period. Global inflation continues to be benign given the slowing growth prospects and lower commodity prices. One area of risk to the inflation outlook emanates from the higher grain prices in response to the continuing drought in the United States. The increasingly unfavourable and volatile global backdrop continues to impact on the rand exchange rate, primarily through changing risk perceptions in global financial markets. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, exchange rate volatility has increased and the rand has fluctuated in a range of between R8,06 and R8,70 against the US dollar, partly in response to fluctuations in the euro against the US dollar. The rand has, however, appreciated since the previous meeting by around 3,4 per cent against the US dollar, by 5,5 per cent against the euro and by 3,7 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. During this period the rand was also impacted by strong inflows into the domestic bond market, following the confirmation that South Africa will be included in the Citibank World Government Bond Index (WGBI) from late September. Since the beginning of the year, non-residents have been net purchasers of South African government bonds to the value of R60,1 bn. In June alone net purchases of bonds by non-residents amounted to R21,7 billion, the second highest monthly inflow ever into the bond market. Much of this is estimated to have been real money inflows, which possibly contributed to the generally appreciating exchange rate trend in that month and declining yields in the domestic government bond market. These inflows are expected to persist for some time after the actual inclusion in the index, and will not only help fund the fiscal deficit but also the widening current account deficit on the balance of payments. The rand is expected to remain vulnerable to erratic shifts in global risk perceptions. While a deterioration of global risk sentiment could cause further rand weakness, this could be offset to some extent by continued inflows into the bond market or the possible resumption of quantitative easing in the United States. The domestic economy appears to be slowing further, following the 2,7 per cent annualised growth rate recorded in the first quarter of 2012. The Bank's forecast of GDP growth for 2012 has been revised down from 2,9 per cent to 2,7 per cent, and to 3,8 per cent in 2013. The forecast for 2014 remains unchanged at 4,1 per cent. However, given the possibility of a more widespread global downturn, the risks to this forecast are seen to be on the downside, with the external impact coming through trade links and commodity prices. The Bank's estimate of the output gap is unchanged at around 3,5 per cent. The composite leading business cycle indicator of the Bank declined for the second consecutive month in April, indicative of the uncertain and subdued outlook. The mining sector is expected to achieve positive but modest growth in the second quarter of 2012 following the 16,8 per cent annualised contraction in the first quarter. In May the three-month-to-three-month growth was 1,3 per cent and 0,8 per cent on a year-on-year basis. Despite this improvement, the mining sector is expected to face a number of challenges including declining commodity prices and further domestic cost pressures which have already resulted in stresses for some platinum mines. The manufacturing sector, which grew at an annualised rate of 7,7 per cent in the first quarter of 2012, is showing some signs of moderation in the second quarter. In May the sector grew at a year-on-year real rate of 4,2 per cent, but contracted by 0,9 per cent on a three-month-to-three-month basis. The Kagiso/BER Purchasing Managers Index fell to 48,2 index points in June, its lowest level since August 2011, as the sub-indices for business activity and new sales orders declined further. This is consistent with the weaker RMB/BER Business Confidence Index which declined by 11 index points to 41 in the second quarter. Growth in real gross fixed capital formation lost momentum, having moderated from an annualised 7,2 per cent rate in the final quarter of 2011 to 5,3 per cent in the first quarter of 2012. Of concern is the substantial decline in the growth of private sector fixed capital formation to 1,8 per cent, following successive quarters of steady increases in excess of 5 per cent during 2011. This development, if sustained, will contribute to the fragility of the growth outlook. By contrast, increases of 13,1 per cent and 9,3 per cent were recorded by public corporations and general government, reflecting capital spending on infrastructure. This was consistent with the improvement in the FNB/BER Civil Construction Confidence Index. However, the FNB Building Confidence Index declined further and remains at low levels with the real value of building plans passed declining by 8,7 per cent on a three-month-to-three-month basis in April. Final consumption expenditure by households, which grew by 5,0 per cent in 2011, also appears to be slowing somewhat, with growth having moderated to 3,1 per cent in the first quarter of 2012. While real retail sales increased by 6,4 per cent on a year-on-year basis, the momentum appears weaker, with sales declining by 0,8 per cent on a month-on-month basis in May, while in the three months to May compared with the previous three months, sales increased by 0,4 per cent. The FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index deteriorated in the second quarter, with the index declining from 5 to -3, the lowest level of the index since 2008. According to the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index, confidence of retailers declined markedly during the same period to its lowest level in two years. Somewhat anomalously, new vehicle sales have remained relatively buoyant. Growth in credit extension to the private sector remains relatively subdued, with twelve-month growth in total loans and advances to the private sector increasing by 8,0 per cent in May. Growth in credit extension to the corporate sector moderated during April and May, while credit extension to households continued to increase, with growth over twelve months of 7,5 per cent in May. This includes the growth in general loans (including personal loans) which has shown a softer trend but still at elevated levels of 30,4 per cent. Mortgage advances remained subdued, reflecting continued weakness in the housing market, while instalment sale credit and leasing finance increased steadily in line with positive vehicle sales. Despite the increase in personal loans, household debt to disposable income declined further to 74,7 per cent in the first quarter of 2012. Personal loans now account for 11,0 per cent of total household debt, but have not led to excessive consumption expenditure. Formal sector employment creation has remained slow. According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics (QES) of Statistics South Africa, in the four quarters to the first quarter of 2012, just over 100,000 jobs were created, representing an increase of 1,2 per cent. The outlook for wage growth is uncertain. Growth in nominal remuneration per worker declined from 6,8 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of 2011, to 6,6 per cent in the first quarter of 2012, while unit labour cost increases declined from 5,8 per cent to 5,7 per cent. This trend may have been reversed recently. According to Andrew Levy Employment publications, the average wage settlement rates amounted to 7,7 per cent in the first half of 2012. The outcome of the public sector wage settlement will be important in this respect. Administered price increases have remained relatively unchanged, but we still await Nersa's determination of tariff increases to be granted to Eskom for the coming years. Some of the other important cost push factors may have reached a lower turning point recently. Domestic food price inflation is still expected to moderate further in the short term, but the medium term outlook is clouded by the drought-induced increases in maize, wheat and soya bean prices in the United States. This has already impacted on domestic prices of both maize and wheat, and poses some upside risk to the inflation outlook. Brent crude oil prices also rebounded from their recent lows of around US$90 per barrel, partly due to geopolitical factors. Currently oil is trading at around US$105 per barrel, well below the levels of almost US$130 per barrel that prevailed earlier this year, and prices are expected to be constrained by weak global demand. The domestic petrol price has declined by a total of R1,40 per litre in the last two months, although a slight increase may be recorded next month. The MPC is concerned about the increased downside risks posed to the domestic economy from global developments. The problems in the Eurozone are likely to persist for a protracted period and since the previous meeting the negative growth outlook has spread beyond Europe, in particular to the US. China. India and other emerging market economies. The negative spill-over effects to South Africa are likely to intensify. This unfavourable outlook is reinforced further by the fragile domestic private sector investment and consumption trends which are confirmed by declining business and consumer confidence. The MPC therefore sees the risks to the growth forecast to be on the downside. The MPC also considered the inflation environment to have improved somewhat, notwithstanding possible pressures coming from food and energy prices in the medium term. Upside pressure on inflation could be offset to some extent by lower global commodity prices, while demand pressures are expected to remain muted. Although the exchange rate is likely to remain vulnerable to global risk aversion, the rand has shown some resilience in recent weeks. The MPC expects inflation to remain within the target range over the forecast period and sees the risks to the inflation forecast to be relatively balanced. In the light of these developments the MPC views the prevailing conditions to be appropriate for further monetary accommodation to the economy that will not undermine the inflation outlook. The MPC has therefore decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 5,0 per cent from Friday 20 July 2012. While it is recognised that such a move on its own will not overcome the challenges facing the economy, it is felt that it can help alleviate some of the pressures faced by some sectors. A sustained increase in the potential output of the economy will require a concerted and coordinated effort from both government and the private sector. The MPC will continue to monitor both domestic and global developments and will act appropriately in line with its mandate."
Israel,2012-07-23,"23.07.2012 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for August 2012 unchanged at 2.25 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Inflation data:The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined by 0.3 percent in June, below forecasts which ranged from a decline of 0.1 percent to an increase of 0.3 percent, and below the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target. The main factors which stood out this month were the declines in the transport and communication component and energy prices, and the more moderate than expected increase in the housing component. The rate of inflation over the previous twelve months declined this month to 1 percent, the lower bound of the inflation target range (of 1-3 percent), comparedwith 1.6 percent in the previous month. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Forecasts of the inflation rate over the next twelve months based on the average of forecasters' inflation predictions, on expectations calculated from the capital markets (break-even inflation), and on inflation expectations based on over-the-counter CPI futures contracts offered by banks, continued to decline this month as well, and range from 1.6 percent to 2 percent, compared with 1.8-2.2 percent the previous month. Inflation expectations for two years andlonger range between 2.3 percent and 2.4 percent, compared with a range of 2.4-2.5 percent in the previous quarter. Expectations for the Bankof Israel interest rate in one year from now, derived from the Telbor (TelAviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, calculated from the makam yield curve, and based on the average projection of forecasters, range between 2.1-2.2 percent. Most forecasters predict that the Bank of Israel interest rate for August will be unchanged, and that the interest rate will be reduced by 0.25 percentage points during the next three months. Real economic activity: Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month raise concerns of a decline in the growth rate, which was already relatively moderate in recent months. This concern is based on particularly weak export data for June. In contrast, the combined monthly indicators in the Composite State of the Economy Index, and expectations reported in surveys, indicate a growth rate which is similar to that of recent months. Manufacturing exports (excluding diamonds) declined inJune by 13 percent compared with May and compared with the monthly averagein January-May. Atypically, the decline in exports encompasses a large number of industries. While it is possible that this is an exceptionalmonthly figure which reflects unusual volatility, the possibility also exists that a decline in such a wide range of export industries is a result ofa sharp decline in global demand. In contrast, the Composite State of the Economy Index, which increased by 0.2 percent in June, and its components, indicate that the economy continues to expand, with stabilization of the growth rate in the second quarter at a similar pace to that of the first quarter of the year. A similar picture arises from the Business Tendency Surveyconducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics, the Bank of Israel's index based on Google searches which serves as an indicator of demand in the economy, and the Purchasing Managers Index. Against this background, the Research Department's nowcasting estimate for GDP growth in the second quarter, based on current economic data, is for 2.8 percent, a pace of growth which is similar to that of recent months. The labor market: Labor market data which became available after the last monetary policy discussion raise the possibility that the improvement in this area has halted. The unemployment rate in May was 7.1 percent, compared with 6.8 percent in April; however, the increase in unemployment came though increases in the employment rate and in the rate of participation in the labor force. In January-April, there was a slowdown in the rate of growth of employee posts, reflecting a slowdown in a wide range of industries. At the same time, the ratio of job vacancies to total employee posts increased to 3.1 percent in June, compared with 2.7 percent in May, and data on the numbers of employed persons in April and May, based on the new Labor Force Survey, are slightly more positive: the number of employed persons increased by 0.4 percent in May, compared with April. Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of total wage payments, were 6.7 percent higher in June in nominal terms than in June 2011 (excluding the effect of legislative changes); May receipts were 5.1 percent higher than in May 2011. Nominal wages increased by 1 percent in February-April compared with the preceding three months, and real wages increased by 0.2 percent. The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: The Bank of Israel Research Department's macroeconomic forecast was updated in June. GDP growth in 2012 was projected to be 3.1 percent, and the forecast for 2013 was 3.4 percent. The inflation rate over the 4 quarters ending in the second quarter of 2013 is expected to be 2.4 percent. The Research Department noted that the main risks to the forecast derive from worldwide developments and their effects on the demand for Israeli exports and on domestic demand, as well as from the effects of the fiscal challenges which the economy faces. Budget data: Actual budget expenditure figures indicate a domestic deficit excluding net credit granted in the first half of the year ofNIS 7.6 billion, compared with a deficit of NIS 3.4 billion in the corresponding period of 2011. In accordance with the revised growth forecast, the deficit in 2012 is projected to be greater than the Ministry of Finance's revised deficit forecast of 3.4 percent of GDP: primarily due to lower than expected revenues for the first half of the year. After the publication of the previous interest rate decision, the government decided to increase the deficit target for 2013 to 3 percent of GDP, compared with its previous target of 1.5 percent of GDP. To date, decisions have not been reachedregarding how the government intends to meet this target. Given the growthforecast, and assuming that steps required to maintain the expenditure target will be taken, the deficit for 2013 is expected to be above 4 percent of GDP. In order to meet the deficit target, tax rates will have to be raised. The decision to increase the deficit target to 3 percent of GDP and the uncertainty of meeting the target raise the concern that the credibility offiscal policy: which was a central component of the economy's success in dealing with the previous crisis: will erode. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on June 24, 2012, through July 20, 2012, the shekel depreciated against the dollar by 2.6 percent, and strengthened by 0.5 percent against the euro. The shekel's weakness against the dollar stood out compared with the trend of most currencies against the dollar. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel depreciated by about 2 percent. The capital and money markets: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on June 24, 2012, through July 20, 2012, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by 0.5 percent, a small increase compared with the trend in developed markets. Yields on government bonds, both CPI-indexed and unindexed, declined 20-30 basis points along most of the curve, due, among other reasons, to nonresident investors purchasing over $600 million ofthose securities during July. The yield gap between Israeli 10-year government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities declined by 16 basis points, to 262 basis points. Makam yields declined by about 25-35 basis points along the entire curve, with one year yields at only 1.96 percent during the period. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by thefive year CDS spread declined by about 18 basis points this month to 157 basis points, similar to developments in many other economies around the world. The Tel-Bond 20 Index increased by about 2.2 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 Index increased by about 2.7 percent, against the background of progressin debt restructuring proceedings for several large companies. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in June, the M 1monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increasedby 2 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 8 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The outstanding debt of the business sector increased in May by 0.9 percent, to NIS 791 billion. Theincrease in the debt derived primarily from the depreciation of the shekel, which increased the shekel value of foreign currency denominated debt. Company responses to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey indicate that companies sense that financing constraints are becoming more severe for non-bank credit, while they sense an easing in obtaining bank credit. Total outstanding credit to households increased in May by 1.1 percent, to NIS 373 billion, within which the balance of outstanding housing credit was NIS 265 billion. Total mortgages granted in the twelve months ending in June were stable compared with those advanced in the twelve months toMay, as the decline from the peak level in May 2011 ended. Unindexed floating rate mortgages granted in June constituted 28 percent of total new mortgages, remaining around the same level as the previous month. Interest rates on indexed mortgage tracks declined by 0.04 percent this month on average, and interest rates on unindexed mortgages declined by around 0.1 percent,continuing their decline of recent months. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (representing rents) increased in June by 0.1 percent. In the twelve months ending in June it increased by 3.4 percent, compared with an increase of 3.8 percent in the twelve months to May. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in theCPI, increased in April-May by 0.7 percent, after increasing by 1.3 percent in March-April. In the twelve months ending in June, homeprices increased by 2.1 percent, slightly above the rate (2.0 percent) in the twelve months to May. Activity in the construction industry is strong compared with its levels in the past decade. Although building starts are below the record level of the middle of 2011, they remain high and are expected to continue to be reflected in an increased inventory of homes. There were 43,952 building starts in the twelve months to April, compared with 44,411 in the twelve months to March. In May, the stock of vacant homes available for sale remained stable at 21,000, after a trend of increase in the past year. The global economy: There was an additional deterioration in economic developments in Europe this month, along with further signs of a slowdown in the global economy's growth rate. Finance ministers of eurozone countries approved an aid package to Spanish banks, and announced measures that they intend to adopt in the future in order to support countries and banks in crisis, though it is still not clear if these steps will in fact beimplemented. Against this background, yields on Spain's government bonds rose to record levels. Macro figures indicate continued deterioration in thestate of the global economy, including in the major emerging economies. The IMF revised downward its global growth forecast for 2012 to 3.5 percent, from 3.6 percent, and for 2013 to 3.9 percent from 4.1 percent. Inflation over the previous 12 months remained unchanged in the US, at 1.7 percent, and in Europe, at 2.4 percent. In China, there was a continued trend of decline in the inflation rate, which reached 2.2 percent. At the same time, in contrast to declines of recent months, agricultural commodity prices increased by 30 percent this month, and energy prices increased by 7.5 percent. The ECB reduced its interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to a record low of 0.75 percent, without taking additional easing steps, and China's centralbank reduced its interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, for the second time this month. The central banks of the UK and Japan announced increases in the scope of their bond purchases. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate for August 2012 unchanged at 2.25 percent, after reducing it the previous month, is consistent with theBank of Israel's interest rate policy which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel, the global economy, monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: Inflation over the previous 12 months was 1 percent. One year forward inflation expectations, both those derived from the capital market and those of forecasters, are near the midpoint of the inflation target range. In contrast, the increase in commodity and energy prices is expected to have an effect on the inflation rate in the near term and draw it near to the center of the targetrange. Over the previous 12 months, there has been a moderation in, and even a halt to, the increase in the housing component of the CPI (based primarily on rents) and in home prices. With that, according to Central Bureau of Statistics surveydata, home prices increased in March-May, though it is premature to determine if there has been a change in trend. This month there was an increase in the level of uncertainty regarding the staying power of the growth rate of real activity in the recent period. Indicators which became available this month continue to support the assessment that the rate of growth in the first half of the year stabilized at slightly below 3 percent. In contrast. June export figures, which registered a sharp decline encompassing most industries, raise the concern that the economy is in anadditional process of moderation in the rate of growth. Uncertainty regarding developments in the economy is affected by, among other things, the uncertainty in fiscal policy. There was an additional deterioration in economic developments in Europe this month, along with further signs of a slowdown in the global economy's growth rate. IMF forecasts of global growth, including the growth in both advanced and emerging economy countries, and of trade volumes, were revised downward. Thelevel of economic risks from the world following developments in Europe remained high, and with it the concern of negative effects on the domestic economy. Several central banks reduced interest rates this month. Finance ministers of eurozonecountries approved an aid package to Spanish banks, and announced measuresthat they intend to adopt in the future in order to support countries and banks in crisis, though it is still not clear if these steps will in fact be implemented. The central banks of the UK and Japan announced an increase in the scope of their bond purchases. Interest rates in the major economiesremained low, and markets are not pricing in any increases in interest rates this year by any of the leading advanced economies' central banks.</tr> Against the background of the previous month's interest rate reduction and the recent weakness of the shekel, which are expected to assist the Israeli economy to deal with the difficulties it faces, the Monetary Committee assessed the factors noted above and voted to leave the interest rate unchanged this month. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light ofthe increasing uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest ratedecision will be published on August 6, 2012. The decision regarding the interest rate for September 2012 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. August 27, 2012. 23.07.2012 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for August 2012 unchanged at 2.25 percent. The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for August 2012 unchanged at 2.25 percent.

Hungary,2012-07-24,"At its meeting on 24 July 2012, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 7.00%. In the Council's judgement, economic output is likely to fall this year, with growth only expected to resume in 2013. The level of output will be below its potential in the period ahead. The consumer price index is expected to remain above the inflation target over the policy horizon, reflecting the effects of tax changes and other administrative measures. CPI inflation in June was higher than previously expected. Measures capturing underlying inflation developments remained at low levels, with transient factors related to a couple of items probably contributing to the pick-up in inflation in the month. Inflationary pressures from the real economy continue to be subdued due to weakening demand, but the tax increases in early 2012, the measures included in the Structural Reform Programme and the latest announcement of an increase in excise duties are likely to cause inflation to exceed the target over a sustained period. The consumer price index is expected to remain significantly above the medium-term target into 2013 as a result of a series of increases in indirect taxes affecting consumer prices. Although this is unlikely to fuel second-round effects due to persistently weak demand and slack in the labour market, meeting the inflation target is expected to be delayed. Hungarian export growth is weighed down by the slowing in external demand, and, moreover, there is significant uncertainty around the recovery in Hungary's export markets expected from the second half of this year. However, the pick-up in production following the build-up of manufacturing capacities over the past quarters may offset the effects of the slowdown in external demand. Domestic demand is likely to fall further in the coming quarters. Persistently high unemployment, falling real incomes and precautionary behaviour by households suggest that consumption will decline over the period ahead. Investment is likely to remain subdued, reflecting the weak outlook for economic activity, the unpredictable business environment and tight credit conditions. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have improved recently, but financial markets remain fragile. Growing risks related to the sustainability of sovereign debt in some euro-area countries may negatively affect premia on Hungarian financial assets; however, stabilisation of fiscal positions in euro-area countries may contribute to an improvement in perceptions about Hungary. The Monetary Council welcomes the start of negotiations between the Government and the EU and IMF. Reaching an agreement in the current volatile environment could lead to a sustained improvement in risk perceptions. It is very important in terms of the future evolution of the risk premium that the Government remain committed to meeting the fiscal deficit target. The Monetary Council has decided to leave the base rate unchanged in light of the above considerations. Monetary policy can best contribute to economic growth by maintaining a predictable economic environment, ensuring price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system. The Council will make every effort to ensure that the upward impact on prices of the measures announced by the Government does not have any second-round consequences and inflation returns to levels consistent with the medium-term target as the direct effects of the measures wear off. The volatile risk environment and above-target inflation for an extended period continue to warrant a cautious policy stance. The Council will consider a reduction in interest rates if Hungary's risk premium falls persistently and substantially and the outlook for inflation improves."
Philippines,2012-07-25,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to reduce the BSP's key policy interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 5.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility, effective immediately. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also reduced accordingly. This is the third time this year that the BSP has cut its policy rates. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that price pressures have been receding, with risks to the inflation outlook slightly skewed to the downside. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that inflation is likely to settle within the lower half of the 3-5 percent target for 2012 and 2013, as pressures on global commodity prices are seen to continue to abate amid weaker global growth prospects. Inflation expectations continue to moderate at levels consistent with the inflation target. Nevertheless, monetary authorities remain watchful over potential upside risks, including pending electricity rate adjustments, expectations of higher prices for some food products due to the prolonged drought in the US, and firm domestic demand pressures. At the same time, the Monetary Board believes that the prospects for global economic activity are likely to remain weak. In the advanced economies, financial market stress continues to build up, and there remain concerns about the prospects for urgent fiscal adjustments and reforms. While the Philippine economy can rely on the resilience of domestic spending to sustain growth, additional policy support would serve as a buffer against strong global headwinds. On balance therefore the benign inflation outlook provides room for a reduction in policy rates as a pre-emptive move against the risks associated with the global slowdown. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions to ensure that monetary policy remains supportive of sustained non-inflationary economic growth."
Thailand,2012-07-25,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 25 July 2012 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting today as follows. Risks to the global economy increased further as weaknesses in consumer spending and the labour market dampened US economic growth, while a comprehensive resolution to the eurozone crisis remained elusive. slowing global economy weighed on Asian and Chinese exports, which continued to soften. Waning global demand was reflected in moderating global price pressure. In this context, some central banks have eased policy with a view to contain downside risks to growth. The Thai economy continued to recover steadily from the floods and was close to potential. Domestic demand growth had been supported by accommodative monetary conditions, strong credit growth, good employment opportunities, and government stimulus measures. These factors should continue to sustain private consumption and investment expenditures going forward. Nonetheless the worsening global economic outlook began to impact on the export sector resulting in a downward revision to the economic growth outlook. Meanwhile inflationary pressure moderated and projected inflation was within the target range. With economic growth close to potential and inflation remaining within target, the MPC deemed that the overall macroeconomic policy mix was appropriate. The MPC voted 5 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 300 percent per annum, with two votes in favour of a 025 percent decrease. The majority of members viewed the current monetary policy stance to be accommodative enough to support domestic economic growth going forward and cushion, to some degree, against global economic risks. The MPC would closely monitor developments in the global economy as well as domestic demand conditions and stood ready to take appropriate action as warranted."
Egypt,2012-07-26,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release July 26, 2012 In its meeting held on July 26, 2012, the Monetary Policy Commi(cid::425)ee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 925 percent and 1025 percent, respec(cid::415)vely, and the 7‐day repo at 975 percen. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 95 percen. Headline CPI declined by 055 percent (m/m) in June following a 024 percent (m/m) decline in May, bringing the annual rate to 726 percent in June from 830 percent recorded in the previous mont. On the other hand, core CPI increased marginally by 028 percent (m/m) in June, while the annual rate declined to 704 percent in June from 722 percent in Ma. The latest monthly developments in both headline and core were largely driven by favorable movements in food prices while non‐food prices remained broadly tam. The re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels pose upside risks to the inflation outloo. Meanwhile real GDP grew by 52 percent in 2011/2012 Q3, following feeble average growth rates of 035 percent in the first two quarter. This rebound was largely driven by a significant favorable base effect from the respective quarter of 2010/2011 during which economic activity was interrupted following the unfolding political event. During the first three quarters of 2011/2012, real GDP expanded by 18 percent on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction sector which was partly suppressed by continuing weaknesses in the manufacturing and tourism sector. In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants over the past year, investment levels remained lo. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Are. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. Given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks and the uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat Sub Governor.

India,2012-07-31,"First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2012-13 Press Statement by Dr.D. Subbarao. Governor. Reserve Bank of India ""First of all, on behalf of the Reserve Bank, a warm welcome to all of you. This morning, we put out the First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2012-13. Based on an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, we have decided to keep the policy rate and the CRR unchanged. Accordingly, the repo rate stays at 8 per cent and the CRR at 4.75 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of scheduled banks. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), determined with a spread of 100 basis points below the repo rate, remains at 7 per cent. Similarly, the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate, which has a spread of 100 bps above the repo rate, also stands unchanged at 9 per cent. Separately, we have decided to reduce the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks from 24 per cent to 23 per cent of their NDTL with effect from the fortnight beginning August 11, 2012. Considerations Behind the Policy Move 5. Let me explain the rationale behind this monetary policy stance. The first question is: what is the rationale for our decision to hold the policy interest rate and the CRR unchanged? The rationale draws from our assessment of the growth-inflation dynamics. As regards inflation, the headline WPI inflation has remained sticky, above 7 per cent. This has been on account of increase in food prices, increase in input costs, and upward revision in prices of some administered items such as coal. Headline inflation has persisted even as growth has moderated and the pricing power of corporates has weakened. Non-food manufactured products inflation has also not declined to the extent warranted by the growth moderation. This reflects severe supply constraints and entrenchment of inflation expectations. Now coming to growth. Growth last year was 6.5 per cent, down from 8.4 per cent in the year before. Although more recent data suggest some pick up, the overall economic activity remains subdued. In order to assess inflationary implications, we need to see the current growth rate in comparison to the trend growth rate. The Reserve Bank's estimates suggest that the post crisis trend rate of growth, which was earlier estimated to be 8.0 per cent, has dropped to 7.5 per cent. This means that the current rate of growth is lower than the trend. However, the output gap, which is the difference between the2 actual and trend rate of growth, will remain relatively small. Under these conditions, demand pressures on inflation can re-emerge quite quickly, exacerbating the existing supply pressures. The second question on our policy stance is about the decision to reduce the SLR by 1 percentage point. Liquidity conditions play an important role in the transmission of monetary policy signals. Although the liquidity situation has eased significantly in the recent period, the reduction of SLR is expected to ensure that liquidity pressures do not constrain the flow of credit to the productive sectors of the economy. This will allow banks to shift their portfolio in favour of the private sector. Monetary Policy Stance 8. Let me now spell out the three broad contours of our monetary policy stance. These are: first, to contain inflation and anchor inflation expectations; second, to support a sustainable growth path over the medium term; and third, to continue to provide liquidity to facilitate credit availability to productive sectors. Guidance 9. As per standard practice, we have also given guidance for the period forward. I will give the gist of that. The primary focus of monetary policy remains inflation control. Low and stable inflation is an essential pre-condition for securing sustainable growth over the medium term. While monetary actions over the past two years may have contributed to the growth slowdown  which is an unavoidable consequence  several other factors have also played a significant role. In the current circumstances, lowering policy rates will only aggravate inflationary impulses without necessarily stimulating growth. As the multiple constraints to growth are addressed, the Reserve Bank will suitably adjust its monetary policy stance. Meanwhile, managing liquidity within the comfort zone remains an objective. The Reserve Bank will respond to liquidity pressures, including by way of open market operations (OMOs). In the current uncertain and turbulent global environment, the risk of external shocks is high. The Reserve Bank stands ready to respond to any such shocks swiftly, using all available instruments. Expected Outcomes 13. We expect that today's policy actions, and the guidance that we have given, will result in the following two outcomes: First, inflation expectations will be anchored based on the commitment of monetary policy to control inflation; and Second, liquidity will be maintained to facilitate smooth flow of credit to the productive sectors of the economy and thereby support growth. Global and Domestic Developments 14. Our policy decisions have been based on a careful assessment of the global and domestic macroeconomic situation. Let me begin with our assessment of the global economy.3 Global Economy 15. Since the Annual Monetary Policy Statement in April 2012, global macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated. There was some upward momentum in the early months of this year. But that has since petered out. Much of the global economy is now in a synchronised slowdown. Despite the slowing global economy, the outlook for commodity prices is uncertain. In the euro area, the possibility of an immediate default has been averted, but the situation continues to cause concern. The two-speed recovery around the world that we were talking about a year ago has now dissipated. Economic activity in emerging and developing economies too has started slowing, but for most of them, inflation has also come down. India is clearly an outlier because even as our growth is slowing in line with the rest of the world, our inflation continues to be high. Indian Economy 17. Moving on to the domestic macroeconomic situation. GDP growth last year was 6.5 per cent, below the Reserve Bank's projection of 7 per cent. In fact, growth decelerated over four successive quarters from 9.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2010-11 to 5.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011-12. The growth slowdown was a result of deceleration in industrial growth as well as in services sector activity. Coming to the current year, in the April Policy, we projected GDP growth of 7.3 per cent on the assumption of a normal monsoon and improvement in industrial activity. Both these assumptions have not held. The monsoon has been deficient and uneven so far. Also, data on industrial production for April- May suggest that industrial activity remains weak. In addition, the risk from the global situation has intensified. Global growth and trade volume are now expected to be lower than projected earlier. Given the greater integration of the Indian economy with the global economy, this will have an adverse impact on growth, particularly in industry and the services sectors. On the basis of the above considerations, the growth projection for the current year (2012-13) has been revised downwards from 7.3 per cent to 6.5 per cent. Inflation 21. Let me now turn to inflation. Headline WPI inflation increased from 7.5 per cent in April to 7.6 per cent in May before moderating to 7.3 per cent in June 2012. The stickiness in inflation, despite the significant growth slowdown, was largely on account of high primary food inflation, which was in double-digits during the first quarter of this year driven by a spike in vegetable prices and sustained high inflation in protein items. Fuel group inflation moderated from 12.1 per cent in April 2012 to 11.5 per cent in May and further to 10.3 per cent in June on account of a decline in non-administered fuel prices. However, the reversal in crude oil prices in recent weeks may add to inflationary pressure. Non-food manufactured products inflation was at 4.8 per cent in May and June 2012. However, input price pressures persist due to both exchange rate movements and supply side constraints. Going forward, further pressure on non-food manufactured products inflation cannot be ruled out.4 24. In contrast to WPI inflation. CPI inflation, as measured by the new Consumer Price Index, remained in double-digits in the first quarter. This was driven by both food and non-food prices. The divergence between WPI and CPI inflation was on account of differences in the composition and weights of commodities in the two indices, as well as different rates of price increases for similar commodities represented in both indices. In the April Policy, the Reserve Bank made a baseline projection of WPI inflation for March 2013 of 6.5 per cent. However, since then several upside risks have arisen: First, the monsoon has been deficient and uneven so far. This will have an adverse impact on food inflation. Second, notwithstanding some moderation, international crude prices remain elevated. On top of that, the rupee depreciation has added to import prices, putting upward pressure on domestic fuel prices. Third, the adjustment of domestic prices of petroleum products to international price changes is still incomplete. Going forward, the embedded risks of suppressed inflation could also impact fuel prices in India. Fourth, non-food manufactured products inflation has not moderated in line with the slowdown in growth. And finally, input price pressures on account of exchange rate movement and infrastructural bottlenecks in coal, minerals and power may exert upward pressure on non-food manufactured products inflation. Keeping in view the recent trends in food inflation, trends in global commodity prices and the likely demand scenario, the baseline projection for WPI inflation for March 2013 is now raised from our April projection of 6.5 per cent to 7.0 per cent. Monetary and Liquidity Conditions 27. Let me now turn to monetary and liquidity conditions. With nominal growth remaining broadly at the level envisaged in the April Policy, monetary aggregates are expected to move along the trajectories projected in the Monetary Policy Statement 2012-13. Accordingly. M growth projection this 3 year has been retained at 15 per cent and the growth in non-food credit of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) at 17 per cent. Liquidity conditions have eased considerably since the April Policy. This turnaround was due to a decline in government cash balances with the Reserve Bank, injection of liquidity of about 860 billion by way of open market operations (OMOs) and increased use of export credit refinance facility by banks after the increase in the limit effected in the June Mid-Quarter Review. Risk Factors 29. Our projections of growth and inflation for 2012-13 are subject to a number of risks. First, external risks to the outlook for the Indian economy are intensifying. Adverse feedback loops between sovereign and financial market stress in the euro area are resulting in increased risk aversion, financial market volatility, and perverse movements in capital flows. With the deteriorating5 macroeconomic situation in the euro area interacting with a loss of growth momentum in the US and in emerging and developing economies, the risk of potentially large negative spillovers has increased. India's growth prospects too will be hurt by this. Second, reflecting the setbacks to the global recovery, as also weather- related adversities in several parts of the world, the outlook for food and commodity prices, especially of crude oil, has turned uncertain. These developments have adverse implications for domestic growth and inflation. Third, inflation in protein items remains elevated due to structural demand supply imbalances. On top of that, there will be further pressure on food inflation because of the deficient and uneven monsoon, thus potentially aggravating inflation and inflation expectations. And finally, at current levels of current account and fiscal deficits, the Indian economy faces the “twin deficit” risk. Financing the fiscal deficit from domestic savings crowds out private investment, thus lowering growth prospects. This, in turn, deters capital inflows, making it more difficult to finance the current account deficit. Failure to narrow the twin deficits with appropriate policy actions will threaten both macroeconomic stability and growth sustainability. Let me now conclude by summarising our macroeconomic concerns. While growth has slowed down significantly, inflation remains well above the comfort zone of the Reserve Bank. Against the backdrop of heightened global uncertainty and domestic macroeconomic pressures, the challenge for monetary policy is to maintain its commitment to firmly containing inflation and lowering inflation expectations. At the same time, monetary policy will remain sensitive to growth risks. I also want to reiterate that the Reserve Bank stands ready to respond to external shocks that may arise from the turbulent global environment. Thank you for your attention."" R. Sinha Press Release : 2012-2013/164 Deputy General Manager."
United States,2012-08-01,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity decelerated somewhat over the first half of this year. Growth in employment has been slow in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Business fixed investment has continued to advance. Household spending has been rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year. Despite some further signs of improvement, the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has declined since earlier this year, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually. Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy. In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. The Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Dennis P Lockhart; Sandra Pianalto; Jerome H Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Jeremy C Stein; Daniel K Tarullo; John C Williams; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M Lacker, who preferred to omit the description of the time period over which economic conditions are likely to warrant an exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate."
Czech Republic,2012-08-02,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 5th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 2 August 2012 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided by a majority vote to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.50%. Four members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for lowering rates by 0.25 percentage point. Reasons for the decision At the monetary policy horizon, headline inflation will be slightly above the CNB's inflation target due to tax changes, monetary- policy relevant inflation will be in the lower half of the tolerance band. Consistent with the forecast is a decline in market interest rates in the next few quarters, followed by a rise in rates in 2014. The message of the forecast baseline scenario Tax changes, commodity prices and exchange rate depreciation are the sources of observed inflation. Headline inflation will fall to the CNB's target in late 2012/early2013, whereas monetary-policy relevant inflation will decline below the target. The Czech economy will fall by 0.9% this year as a result of a marked slowdown in external demand and subdued domestic demand against the background of fiscal consolidation. In 2013. GDP growth will reach 0.8%, as external demand will gradually recover but fiscal policy will be restrictive. The nominal exchange rate against the euro is very slowly appreciating. Consistent with the forecast is a decline in market interest rates in the next few quarters, followed by a rise in rates in 2014."
Euroarea,2012-08-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Rehn. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged, following the decrease of 25 basis points in July. As we said a month ago, inflation should decline further in the course of 2012 and be below 2% again in 2013. Consistent with this picture, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area economy continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At the same time, economic growth in the euro area remains weak, with the ongoing tensions in financial markets and heightened uncertainty weighing on confidence and sentiment. A further intensification of financial market tensions has the potential to affect the balance of risks for both growth and inflation on the downside. The Governing Council extensively discussed the policy options to address the severe malfunctioning in the price formation process in the bond markets of euro area countries. Exceptionally high risk premia are observed in government bond prices in several countries and financial fragmentation hinders the effective working of monetary policy. Risk premia that are related to fears of the reversibility of the euro are unacceptable, and they need to be addressed in a fundamental manner. In order to create the fundamental conditions for such risk premia to disappear, policy-makers in the euro area need to push ahead with fiscal consolidation, structural reform and European institution-building with great determination. As implementation takes time and financial markets often only adjust once success becomes clearly visible, governments must stand ready to activate the EFSF/ESM in the bond market when exceptional financial market circumstances and risks to financial stability exist  with strict and effective conditionality in line with the established guidelines. The adherence of governments to their commitments and the fulfilment by the EFSF/ESM of their role are necessary conditions. The Governing Council, within its mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term and in observance of its independence in determining monetary policy, may undertake outright open market operations of a size adequate to reach its objective. In this context, the concerns of private investors about seniority will be addressed. Furthermore, the Governing Council may consider undertaking further non-standard monetary policy measures according to what is required to repair monetary policy transmission. Over the coming weeks, we will design the appropriate modalities for such policy measures. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. On a quarterly basis, euro area real GDP growth was flat in the first quarter of 2012, following a decline of 0.3% in the previous quarter. Economic indicators point to weak economic activity in the second quarter of 2012 and at the beginning of the third quarter, in an environment of heightened uncertainty. Looking beyond the short term, we expect the euro area economy to recover only very gradually, with growth momentum being further dampened by a number of factors. In particular, tensions in some euro area sovereign debt markets and their impact on financing conditions, the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors and high unemployment are expected to weigh on the underlying growth momentum, which is also affected by the ongoing global slowdown. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. They relate, in particular, to the tensions in several euro area financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to possible renewed increases in energy prices over the medium term. Euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.4% in July 2012, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, unchanged from the previous month. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates should decline further in the course of 2012 and be below 2% again in 2013. Over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain moderate. Risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be broadly balanced over the medium term. Upside risks pertain to further increases in indirect taxes, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation, and higher than expected energy prices over the medium term. The main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area, in particular resulting from a further intensification of financial market tensions. Such intensification has the potential to affect the balance of risks on the downside. Turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remained subdued. The annual growth rate of M3 stood at 3.2% in June 2012, slightly higher than the 3.1% observed in the previous month and close to the rate observed at the end of the first quarter. Overall, inflows into broad money in the second quarter were weak. Annual growth in M1 increased further to 3.5% in June, in line with the increased preference of investors for liquid instruments in an environment of low interest rates and high uncertainty. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) declined to 0.3% in June (from 0.5% in May). As net redemptions of loans to non-financial corporations and households (both adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) were observed in June, the annual growth rates for loans to both non-financial corporations and households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) decreased further in June, to -0.3% and 1.1% respectively. To a large extent, subdued loan growth reflects the current cyclical situation, heightened risk aversion and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises, all of which weigh on credit demand. A considerable contribution of demand factors to weak MFI loan growth is confirmed by the euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2012. This survey also shows that the net tightening of banks' credit standards at the euro area level was broadly stable in the second quarter of 2012, as compared with the previous quarter, for loans to both enterprises and households. Looking ahead, it is essential for banks to continue to strengthen their resilience where this is needed. The soundness of banks' balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. While significant progress has been achieved with fiscal consolidation over recent years, further decisive and urgent steps need to be taken to improve competitiveness. From 2009 to 2011, euro area countries, on average, reduced the deficit-to-GDP ratio by 2.3 percentage points, and the primary deficit improved by about 2½ percentage points. Fiscal adjustment in the euro area is continuing in 2012, and it is indeed crucial that efforts are maintained to restore sound fiscal positions. At the same time, structural reforms are as essential as fiscal consolidation efforts and the measures to repair the financial sector. For example, unit labour costs and current account developments have started to undergo a correction process in most of the countries strongly affected by the crisis. However, further reform measures need to be implemented swiftly and decisively. Product market reforms to foster competitiveness and the creation of efficient and flexible labour markets are preconditions for the unwinding of existing imbalances and the achievement of robust, sustainable growth. It is now crucial that Member States implement their country-specific recommendations with determination."
Romania,2012-08-02,"The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference on August 6, 2012. Developments in macroeconomic indicators show the evolution of inflation in line with the central bank's forecasts. At the same time, heightened asymmetric risks to the inflation outlook have emerged amid an adverse external environment and domestic political tensions. After reaching a record low of 1.79 percent in May 2012, the annual inflation rate grew slightly to 2.04 percent in June, on account of the unfavourable base effect anticipated to become temporarily manifest especially in the third quarter of 2012. The annual adjusted CORE 21 inflation rate hovered around 2.0 percent given that the persistence of the negative output gap attenuated the unfavourable impact of the recent leu depreciation. The external environment was marked by deteriorating prospects of global economic activity against the background of increased investor risk aversion and of the uncertainties surrounding a sustainable resolution of the euro area sovereign debt crisis. These developments, combined with persistent domestic political tensions, generated net capital outflows with an unfavourable impact on the leu exchange rate. The slowdown in foreign currency credit growth also triggered a moderation of the expansion in lending to the private sector. The monetary policy stance remained prudent with a view to consolidating the outlook for maintaining the inflation rate inside the variation band around the target and creating the prerequisites for a lasting economic recovery. In today's meeting, the NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses developments in the recent macroeconomic environment, in inflation and its outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the period ahead. The updated forecast reconfirms the prospects of the annual inflation rate to remain within the variation band around the target throughout the forecast horizon, despite the short-term outlook being marked by conjunctural trends in financial markets and the unfavourable temporary impact of the above-mentioned base effect. Heightened risk aversion, against the background of an unfavourable external environment and of possibly persistent domestic political tensions together with the above-mentioned developments, calls for further maintaining a prudent monetary policy stance. This requires securing adequate real broad monetary conditions in order to efficiently anchor expectations, achieve the objective of maintaining price stability in the medium term and ensure a smooth functioning of financial markets. Therefore, the NBR Board has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 5.25 percent per annum, to ensure adequate liquidity management in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR restates that achieving price and financial stability objectives in the context of the further fulfilment of commitments under the arrangements with the European Union, the IMF and other international financial institutions is crucial to sustain lasting economic growth in the context of a balanced macroeconomic policy mix. The NBR will continue to closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by an adequate dosage of its instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives to achieve price stability over the medium term, as well as financial stability. The quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference on August 6, 2012. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for September 27, 2012. 1Calculated by the NBR by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index.

Armenia,2012-08-05,"Press Release 08.05.2012 Interest rate unchanged, 8 percent In the May 8th of 2012 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. There was 1.3 percent deflation recorded in May of 2012, and the 12-month inflation amounted to 0.5 percent, which is somewhat below the confidence band. The Board admitted that further uncertainties over political solutions to debt problems in Eurozone has led to an abrupt U.S. dollar appreciation versus currencies of Armenia's main trade partners, the European union and Russia in particular. This affected the foreign exchange market of the country as the local currency, the Dram, depreciated versus the U.S. dollar. In the meanwhile, the main commodities and food markets of the world are seeing deflationary environment in the face of risks to slowing rates of global demand. Despite the impact of private spending and fiscal policy on domestic prices now is estimated non-inflationary, the Board reckons that the dram depreciation versus the U.S. dollar in May (which is per se easing of monetary conditions) will be going to put its inflationary impact on prices. Although the 12-month inflation now is 0.5 percent, the 12- month core inflation rests within the confidence band. In consideration of the current situation, the Board decided to withdraw from further easing of monetary conditions through the interest rate. Aimed to reduce interest rate fluctuations in interbank market, the Board made a decision to lessen the spread between Deposit facility rate and Lombard Repo facility rate from 6 pp to 5 pp and gradually lower it to 3 pp by the end of the year. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in the Minutes on Interest Rate due on June 15, 2012. The Central Bank Public Relations."
South Korea,2012-08-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.00% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.00% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the economic recovery in the US to have weakened somewhat and the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have deepened. Growth has also continued to slow in emerging market countries, due mostly to the impact of the economic slumps in advanced countries. The Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be very moderate going forward as well, with the uncertainties surrounding the euro area fiscal crisis and the international financial markets persisting. In Korea, the Committee appraises the trend of economic growth to have slowed, owing to lackluster exports and domestic demand amid a continued surplus in the current account. On the employment front, the uptrend in the number of persons employed is being sustained, led by the higher age groups and the service industry. The Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will sustain a negative output gap for a considerable time going forward, due mostly to the increase in euro area risks and the sluggish economies of its major trading partners. Consumer price inflation came in low at 1.5% in July, owing chiefly to the ongoing stable trend of international oil prices and to favorable weather conditions, and core inflation also posted a significantly low figure. The Committee forecasts that inflation will remain at a low level for the time being, despite for instance pressures to hike public utility fees and the instability of international grain prices. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas declined at a faster pace and their uptrend in the rest of the country slowed. 1 In the financial markets, price variables have shown fluctuations influenced mainly by the changes in international financial market conditions and revisions of domestic and world economic forecasts; stock prices have risen and the Korean won has appreciated against the US dollar. Long-term market interest rates have fallen substantially, due mostly to the impacts of the economic slowdown and of last month's Base Rate cut. Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring external risk factors and the consequent changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and also continuing its efforts to lower inflation expectations, will conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the inflation target over a medium-term horizon amid continuing sound growth of the economy."
Russia,2012-08-10,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 10 August 2012 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain the refinancing rate and the interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations unchanged (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects, taking into account the global economic uncertainty and the observed tightening of domestic monetary conditions. In July and in the beginning of August inflation increased, but stays in the target range for 2012: as of 6 of August the pace of inflation was estimated at 5.7% over a year ago. Core inflation in August registered a minor change and amounted to 5.3%. Higher pace of inflation was attributed to the planned increase in the majority of regulated prices and tariffs as well as the accelerated growth of the food prices. The worsening of the food market conditions in Russia and globally as well as the downward revision of this year's crop harvest are the important sources of inflation risks, particularly taking into account their influence on inflation expectations. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, gross output remains close to its potential level, which implies an absence of significant demand-pull price pressures. Production in manufacturing in the second quarter of the year was high, while consumer and producer confidence indicators remained fairly strong. Taking this into account the Bank of Russia does not consider the deceleration of growth in industrial production in June as indicating higher risks of economic slowdown. Retail sales growth rate remains high, while labour market conditions together with household credit expansion continue to support robust domestic demand. Still in the recent months there were signs of the stabilization of the growth rates of credit to non-financial organizations and individuals on the back of the increasing interest rates in the economy which the Bank of Russia associates with the spreading of the effects of the money market rates increase resulting from the steady banking sector demand on the Bank of Russia refinancing operations. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks, the influence of global economic developments and the consequences of the observed tightening of monetary conditions on the Russian economy. In making monetary policy decisions the Bank of Russia will rely on medium-term inflation goals and economic growth prospects, as well as the dynamics of inflation expectations. The next meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the first half of September 2012.

Peru,2012-08-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2012 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based on that inflation's deviation from the target has reflected transitory supply factors and on that the economy's pace of growth is close to its potential rate of growth. Moreover, uncertainty remains in international financial markets, which is being reflected in the decline of terms of trade and in prospects of lower growth in both developed and emerging countries. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider additional adjustments in monetary policy tools. Inflation in July registered a monthly rate of 0.09 percent, as a result of which inflation in the last 12 months declined from 4.00 percent in June to 3.28 percent in July. Core inflation recorded a rate of 0.20 percent in July and thus accumulated a rate of 3.58 percent in the last 12 months. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.16 percent and an annual rate of 2.42 percent. The evolution of inflation in July shows that the supply factors that led inflation to rise transitorily above the target range continue to reverse. Adverse climate conditions in the major producing countries of grains have temporarily raised the international prices of these commodities. Despite this price rises, inflation is expected to gradually converge to the target range in the rest of the year. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show that the economy's growth has stabilized around its long-term sustainable level of growth, although the indicators associated with the external market register a weak performance. On the other hand, indicators of global economic activity show that uncertainty about the pace of global economic activity has increased. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for September on its session of September 6, 2012."
Chile,2012-08-16,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 16 August 2012 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). Internationally, financial tensions in the Eurozone have declined slightly and international financial conditions show some improvement. However, uncertainty continues, the risk premiums of some European economies remain very high and an upsurge of these tensions in the coming months cannot be ruled out. Advanced economies continue to post weak growth, while emerging markets have slowed down somewhat more than previously forecast. International food and energy prices have picked up in the last month, while metal prices remain largely unchanged from last month. Domestically, output and demand indicators have evolved somewhat above projections in June's Monetary Policy Report, driven mainly by increased inventory accumulation and, to a lesser extent, by consumption. The labor market remains tight, although employment growth has moderated further and no acceleration of labor costs is observed. The peso has appreciated. Y‐o‐y CPI inflation and core inflation measures remain below 3%. In the last few months, the most volatile components of the basket (i.e., energy and foodstuffs) showed a negative incidence on the CPI, which could diminish or revert going forward, given their recent performance in international markets. Inflation expectations over the policy horizon remain around the target. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Turkiye,2012-08-16,"Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand continues as envisaged. Domestic demand displays a modest recovery, while exports continue to grow despite the weakening global outlook. Overall, aggregate demand conditions support disinflation and current account balance continues to improve gradually. The Committee expects inflation to follow a downward course in the forthcoming period as indicated in July Inflation Report. However, pricing behavior should be closely monitored as inflation will continue to stay above the target for some time. The Committee has stated that, given the prevailing uncertainties regarding the global economy, it would be appropriate to preserve the flexibility of the monetary policy on both sides. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. Moreover, in order to support financial stability, the Committee has approved an additional increase in the ratio of allowance to hold Turkish lira reserve requirements in foreign currency and gold, and a limited increase in the coefficient of the option to hold foreign exchange for the Turkish lira reserve requirements (reserve option coefficient) for the first tranche. In light of these developments, the Committee has indicated that interest rate corridor may be narrowed gradually in the forthcoming period. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2012-08-27,"Inflation over the previous 12 months is 1.4 percent, and on a seasonally adjusted basis, inflation since the beginning of the year is below the lower bound of the target range. However, inflation expectations which had declined in recent months, increased markedly this month as a result of an increase in prices of commodities and energy, and changes in indirect taxes. Indicators which became available this month support the assessment that the economy is growing at a rate similar to that of recent quarters, of around 3 percent. With that, data from surveys of economic activity indicateexpectations of a slowdown in the rate of growth. Likewise, a continued trend of moderation in world trade is liable to lead to a decline in the economy's growth rate. At the same time, the recent weakness of the shekel is expected to aid the economy in dealing with the negative developments abroadwhich are expressed in reduced demand for Israeli exports. Over the past 12 months, there has been a moderation, and even a halt, in the increase in home prices. With that, there was an increase this monthin new mortgages granted, though it is too early to tell if there has beena change in the trend. The level of economic risks from around the world, due to the developments in Europe, remains high: leading to concerns of negative effectson the domestic economy. Second quarter macro figures which became available this month indicate continued deterioration in the state of the economies in the eurozone, the UK. Japan, and emerging markets. In contrast, there was a slight improvement in US economic activity this month. Most economies did not change their monetary policy this month, and interest rates at major economies remained low. In addition, markets are not pricing in any increases in interest rates this year by any of the leading advanced economies' central banks. This month, the ECB president announced anew program for intervention by the central bank in government bond markets, though concrete steps to implement the policy have not yet been taken. Currency (Unit) Rate Daily Change. Nominal Effective Rate -0.085%. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.1 percent in July, in line with forecasts, and below the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target. The main factors which stood out this month were the increase in the housing index and the decline in the food and energy components. The rate of inflation over the previous twelve months was 1.4 percent, compared with 1 percent the previous month. On a seasonally adjusted basis, inflation since the beginning of the year has been 0.9 percent in annual terms. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Forecasts of the inflation rate over the next twelve months based on the average of forecasters' inflation predictions, on expectations calculated from the capital markets (break-even inflation), and on inflation expectations based on over-the-counter CPI futures contracts offered by banks, increased this month, and range from 2.3 percent to 2.6 percent, compared with 1.6-2 percent in the previous month. The increase this month came after several months of decline in inflation expectations, and apparently derives from plannedincreases in indirect taxes, increased global commodity prices which are expected to have an effect on local prices as well, and from the depreciation of the shekel. According to forecasters, prices are expected to increase by 1.3 percent over the next three months. Inflation expectations for two years and longer increased slightly and currently range between 2.3 percent and 2.4 percent. Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate one yearfrom now, derived from the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, as well as those based on the average projection of forecasters, range between 1.9-2.1 percent. Half of the forecasters predict that the Bank of Israel interest rate for September will be unchanged, but that the interest rate will be reduced by 0.25 percentage points in the next three months, while half the forecasters expect the interest rate to be reduced by 0.25 percentage points this month. Real economic activity: Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month support the assessment that the economy is growing at a rate similar to that of recent quarters, a rate whichis in line with the Bank of Israel's growth forecast for 2012, of 3.1 percent. According to a preliminary estimate of National Accounts figures for the second quarter of the year (annualized, seasonally adjusted). GDP increased by 3.2 percent, compared with 2.8 percent in the previous quarter; business sector product increased by 3.7 percent, compared with 2.2 percent in the previous quarter; private consumption increased 5.4 percent, compared with 6.2 percent in the previous quarter; fixed capital formation declined by 1.1 percent, compared with an increase of 3 percent in the previous quarter; and exports (excluding diamonds) increased 9.8 percent, compared with 4.9 percent in the previous quarter. It is noted that first estimates of quarterly National Accounts data are volatile, and subject to marked revisions. Second quarter National Accounts data: primarily exports: were apparently effected positively by the opening of a major factory. Net of this effect, the level of exports is similar to the level of the previousquarter. The Composite State of the Economy Index for July increased by 0.2 percent, though the forecast of real activity as reflected in various surveys is for a slowdown in activity in the economy. The labor market: Second quarter data from the LabourForce Survey, in its new format, indicate continued growth in employment and an unusual increase in the participation rate (0.8 percentage points), which was reflected in an increase in the employment rate (59.1 percent in the second quarter compared with 58.5 percent in the previous quarter), and an increase in the unemployment rate for the second quarter to 7 percent. At the same time, there was an increase in the rate of workers employed fulltime. In contrast, survey figures for the month of June indicate a slight decline in the employment rate compared with May, and National Insurance data show that in July, there was an increase of more than 10 percent in the number of new claims for unemployment benefits (seasonally adjusted), compared with the previous month. Compared with July of last year, the increase is about 17 percent. Nominal wages of Israelis increased by 1 percent in March-May, seasonally adjusted, compared with the preceding three months, and real wages increased by 0.3 percent. Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of total wage payments, were 6 percent higher in July in nominal terms than in July 2011 (excluding the effect of legislative changes), a rate of change similar to that in previous months. The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: The Bank of Israel Research Department's most recent macroeconomic forecast was formulated in June. GDP growth in 2012 was projected to be 3.1 percent, and the forecast for 2013 was 3.4 percent. The inflation rate over the 4 quarters ending in the second quarter of 2013 is expected to be 2.4 percent. Based on developments since the end of June, it is likely that the growth rate projection for 2013 will be revised downward in the September update to the forecast. Budget data: Actual budget expenditure figures indicate a domestic deficit, excluding net credit granted in the year to date through July, of NIS 9.3 billion, compared with a deficit of NIS 3.6 billion in the corresponding period of 2011. The deficit in 2012 is projected to be between 3.5-4 percent of GDP, primarily due to lower than expected revenues for the first half of the year. In order to reduce the expected deficit in 2012 and to meet the deficit target for 2013 set by the government, 3 percent of GDP, the government and Knesset decided this month on several steps to increase tax rates, some already taking effect in 2012 and the remainder beginning in January 2013. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion heldon July 22, 2012, through August 24, 2012, the shekel depreciated against the dollar by 0.7 percent, and depreciated by 2.9 percent against the euro. The shekel's weakness against the dollar stood out compared with the appreciation of most major currencies against the dollar. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel depreciated by about 1.6 percent.</div> The capital and money markets: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on July 22, 2012, through August 24, 2012, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 3.4 percent, in line with the global trend, against the background of increased monetary easing in major markets worldwide. Yields on unindexed government bonds followed the global trend with an increase of 40 basis points, primarily in short to medium term maturities, as investors shifted funds during the month toward the indexed segment due to an increase in inflation expectations. On the CPI-indexed curve, yields declined by up to 20 basis points in the short to medium terms. The yield gap between 10-year Israeli government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities declined by 20 basis points, to about 245 basis points. Makam yields increased by about 10-25 basis points along the entire curve, with one year yields increasing to 1.97 percent during the period. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five year CDS spread increased by about 7 basis points this month to 163 basis points, in contrast to CDS spread declines in many other economies around the world. The Tel-Bond 20 Index and the Tel-Bond 40 Index were mostly unchanged by the end of the period, with increases of only 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in July, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 6.3 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 8.7 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The outstanding debt of the business sector increased in June by 0.2 percent, to NIS 792 billion. The increase in the debt derived primarily from the depreciation of the shekel, which increased the shekel value of foreign currency denominateddebt. Total outstanding credit to households increased in June by 0.4 percent, to NIS 375 billion, within which the balance of outstanding housing credit was NIS 267 billion. The total volume of new mortgages granted in Julywas NIS 4.9 billion, compared with NIS 3.9 billion in June. It should be noted that there is usually an increase in new mortgages granted during Juneand July, and it is likely that the volume of mortgages taken out in July was affected by purchases brought forward ahead of the expected VAT increase. Total new mortgages granted in the twelve months ending in July increased by 2 percent compared with the twelve months ending in June, and the decline in this figure which began in May of last year ended. Mortgage interest rates continued to decline this month on all indexation tracks, primarily in the unindexed, floating rate, segment, continuing their decline of recent months. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (representing rents) increased by 1 percent in July. In the twelve months ending in July it increased by 4 percent, compared with an increase of 3.4 percent in the twelve months to June. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased in May-June by 0.1 percent, after increasing by 0.4 percent in April-May. In the twelve months ending in June, home prices increased by 1.2 percent, compared with an increase of 1.7 percent in the twelve months to May. Activity in the construction industry isstrong compared with its levels in the past decade. Although building starts are below the record level of the middle of 2011, they remain high and are expected to continue to be reflected in an increased inventory of homes. There were 42,319 building starts in the twelve months to May, compared with 43,927 in the twelve months to April. In June, the stock of vacant homesavailable for sale was 20,600, maintaining the stable level of the past year. According to a Ministry of Finance publication, preliminary figures forJuly indicate an unusual increase in the number of home purchases. With that, it is likely that this increase derives from, among other things, purchases brought forward due to expectations for an increase in VAT. The global economy: Some easing was felt in markets this month, against the background of the announcement by the ECB president of a new plan for intervention by the central bank in the market for government bonds of countries prepared to adopt recovery plans, expectations of further expansionary plans worldwide, and the improvement in some US economic data during the past month. This easing was reflected in declines of yields on government bonds of Spain and Italy, and by an increase in stock market indices around the world. With that, second quarter growth figures published this month indicate reduced activity in the eurozone and a marked slowdown in Germany. Weak data on real economic activity were also released in the UK and Japan. In emerging market economies, particularly China, macroeconomic data continued to indicate a slowdown in the rate of growth. In contrast, a slight improvement was recorded in US economic activity this month.Investment houses revised downward their 2013 forecasts for global growth,to 3.3 percent from 3.4 percent; for US growth, to 2.1 percent from 2.2 percent; and for growth in Europe, to 0.1 percent from 0.3 percent. In commodity markets, oil prices continued to increase and the agricultural commodities index was unchanged at the high level it reached in the past two months. Inflation rates in most major economies continued to moderate. After a series of monetary expansion steps by central banks in some economies recently, there were no changes in the past month in the monetary policy of those economies. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate for September 2012 unchanged at 2.25 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policywhich is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel, the global economy, monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: Inflation over the previous 12 months is 1.4 percent, and on a seasonally adjusted basis, inflation since the beginning of the year is below the lower bound of the target range. Against this background, the Monetary Committee assessed the factors noted above and voted to leave the interest rate unchanged this month. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the increasing uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on September 10, 2012. The decision regarding the interest rate for October 2012 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. September 24, 2012. The capital and money markets: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on July 22, 2012, through August 24, 2012, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 3.4 percent, in line with the global trend, against the background of increased monetary easing in major markets worldwide. With that, it is likely that this increase derives from, among other things, purchases brought forward due to expectations for an increase in VAT.

Hungary,2012-08-28,"At its meeting on 28 August 2012, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 25 basis points from 7.00% to 6.75%, with effect from 29 August 2012. In the Council's judgement, economic output is likely to fall this year, with growth only expected to resume in 2013. The level of output will be below its potential in the period ahead. The consumer price index is expected to remain above the inflation target over the policy horizon, reflecting the effects of tax changes, administrative measures and the increase in commodity prices. CPI inflation in June and July was higher than previously expected, as a result of higher unprocessed food prices and the increase in excise duties in the course of the year. Inflationary pressures from the real economy continue to be subdued due to weakening domestic demand, but the tax increases in early 2012, the measures included in the Structural Reform Programme and the latest announcement of an increase in excise duties are likely to cause inflation to exceed the target over a sustained period. Higher-than-expected global oil prices and the unfolding food price shock represent upside risks to inflation. The latter has been reflected in developments in unprocessed food prices in recent months. The consumer price index is expected to remain significantly above the medium-term target into 2013, as a result of a series of increases in indirect taxes affecting consumer prices. Although the risk of second-round effects is low due to persistently weak demand and slack in the labour market, meeting the inflation target is expected to be delayed. Second-quarter GDP data reflect a weakening in general economic activity. The contraction in output in the quarter implies that the economy is technically in recession. The sharp slowdown in external demand is pulling down on the outlook for Hungarian exports. The decline in industrial production continued, despite steady growth in capacity in the automobile industry. Falls in the construction sector, agriculture and retail trade outweighed the rise in vehicle production. Domestic demand is likely to fall further in the coming quarters. Investment will remain subdued, reflecting the weak outlook for economic activity, the unpredictable business environment and tight credit conditions. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have fallen further recently; however, that improvement has been driven mostly by external factors. Positive international investor sentiment reflected announcements related to euro-area crisis management, but decision and implementation risks associated with measures designed to address problems related to sovereign debt sustainability within the euro area remained. The Government's commitment to maintaining a sound fiscal policy and to reaching an agreement with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund is crucial in terms of the future evolution of the risk premium. The Monetary Council has decided to reduce the base rate in light of the above considerations. The Council will continue to closely monitor underlying inflation developments. Monetary policy can only be eased to the extent that supply shocks to the economy and the upward impact on prices of the Government's measures do not lead to the build-up of second-round inflationary effects and perceptions about the Hungarian economy continue to improve."
Georgia,2012-08-29,"29.08.12 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate unchanged at 5.75% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on August 29, 2012 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 5.75 percent. The core and headline inflation values in July were low, with the annual inflation reaching 0.6%. According to the existing forecasts this year and in the beginning of the next year the inflation will remain at low level will achieve its target value in the second half of the next year. The economic activity indicators similarly to the first half of the year point at a high growth in the third quarter as well, although the output gap is still close to zero. It should be noted that the economic growth in 2012 is mostly due to the investment, meaning that there are low risks of demand side inflationary pressure. This growth in capital formation was reflected in the import growth as well, with the high growth in the import of investment goods. Given that the inflation is predicted to achieve the target in the medium term and that the output gap is insignificant the National Bank of Georgia decided to keep the Monetary Policy Rate unchanged. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on September 26, 2012."
Poland,2012-09-05,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 5 September 2012 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 4-5 September 2012 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 4.75% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at6.25% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 3.25% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate at 5.00% on an annual basis. Global economic activity remains low. Recession in the euro area has been accompanied by moderate growth in the United States. In emerging economies economic growth decreased in Q2 2012. Subdued global economic growth supported easing of inflation in many countries. Recently, the sentiment in the international financial markets has improved somewhat, which has supported prices of some financial assets and encouraged capital inflows to emerging markets. At the same time, global prices of agricultural and energy commodities have risen considerably. The data on GDP in Poland point to slower than expected economic growth in 2012 Q2. Growth of consumption and investment expenditures, including corporate investment, decreased. Change in inventories made a significantly negative contribution to GDP growth. Exports growth also slowed down. However, due to a simultaneous decline in imports, net exports were a major contributor to GDP growth. Weaker output growth was accompanied by deteriorating corporate financial results. At the same time, industrial production and retail sales in July rose faster than on average in 2012 Q2. Yet, the decline in construction output continued and business indicators remain unfavourable. According to the Labour Force Survey, in 2012 Q2 employment growth came to a halt and the unemployment rate was higher than a year ago, mainly due to a further increase in the labour force participation. At the same time, wage growth in the economy, including the corporate sector, decelerated. The economic slowdown was accompanied with a gradual deceleration in corporate lending. Lending to households also continued to slow down, driven by further decline in consumer loans and slower growth in mortgage lending, including decrease in foreign currency loans. Yet, the household savings rate continued to decline in 2012 Q1. After a temporary rise in June. CPI inflation fell to 4.0% in July. However, it remained above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. Inflation net of food and energy prices did not change. At the same time, households' inflation expectations stayed elevated. 00-919 Warszawa, ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, tel. (22) 653 28 88, fax (22) 653 13 28 In the opinion of the Council, inflation will decrease gradually over the coming months, as the statistical base effect wanes amidst slowing demand in the economy. The recently observed increase in global commodity prices poses an upward risk to the expected decrease in inflation. In the medium term, economic slowdown will be conductive to inflation returning to the target. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. Should the incoming data confirm further weakening of economic conditions, and should the risk of increase in inflationary pressure be limited, the Council will consider adjustment of monetary policy."
Thailand,2012-09-05,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 5 September 2012 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting today as follows. The MPC assessed that overall risks to the global economy remained elevated. Economic recovery in the US continued to be tepid, and despite improvements in consumption and production, they remained below normal. The eurozone economy had entered recession and was projected to weaken further in the latter half of the year due to markedly dampened consumer and investor confidence. The impact of weaker global demand on Chinese and Asian economies became more apparent, as reflected by lower‐ than‐expected export growth in many countries. Nonetheless a number of Asian economies continued to expand at a solid pace on the back of strong domestic demand. The Thai economy in the second quarter grew at a faster rate than previously projected. Strong momentum in consumption and investment was likely to sustain a positive trend in domestic demand going forward. Key supporting factors included strong private sector confidence, favourable labour market conditions, higher household income, and accommodative monetary conditions with private credit growth, in particular, remaining strong. Government stimulus measures also continued to contribute positively, although overall disbursement was partially delayed. Nonetheless the impact of slowing global demand on Thai exports would become more apparent and it was possible that export growth this year would be lower than expected. Economic stability remained sound with further moderation in inflationary pressure and the inflation forecast remaining within the target range. The MPC viewed that the impact of slower global demand on the Thai economy had increased to some extent. Nonetheless domestic demand remained robust and current monetary conditions were accommodative enough to support continued economic expansion. Credit growth in some sectors had been rapid and warranted close monitoring. The MPC thus voted 3 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 300 percent per annum, with two votes in favour of a 025 percent decrease. The MPC would closely monitor developments in the global economy as well as domestic demand conditions and stood ready to take appropriate action as warranted. Two members were unable to attend this meeting due to obligations abroad."
Euroarea,2012-09-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Rehn. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Owing to high energy prices and increases in indirect taxes in some euro area countries, inflation rates are expected to remain above 2% throughout 2012, to fall below that level again in the course of next year and to remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Consistent with this picture, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area economy continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Economic growth in the euro area is expected to remain weak, with the ongoing tensions in financial markets and heightened uncertainty weighing on confidence and sentiment. A renewed intensification of financial market tensions would have the potential to affect the balance of risks for both growth and inflation. It is against this background that the Governing Council today decided on the modalities for undertaking Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) in secondary markets for sovereign bonds in the euro area. As we said a month ago, we need to be in the position to safeguard the monetary policy transmission mechanism in all countries of the euro area. We aim to preserve the singleness of our monetary policy and to ensure the proper transmission of our policy stance to the real economy throughout the area. OMTs will enable us to address severe distortions in government bond markets which originate from, in particular, unfounded fears on the part of investors of the reversibility of the euro. Hence, under appropriate conditions, we will have a fully effective backstop to avoid destructive scenarios with potentially severe challenges for price stability in the euro area. Let me repeat what I said last month: we act strictly within our mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term; we act independently in determining monetary policy; and the euro is irreversible. In order to restore confidence, policy-makers in the euro area need to push ahead with great determination with fiscal consolidation, structural reforms to enhance competitiveness and European institution-building. At the same time, governments must stand ready to activate the EFSF/ESM in the bond market when exceptional financial market circumstances and risks to financial stability exist  with strict and effective conditionality in line with the established guidelines. The adherence of governments to their commitments and the fulfilment by the EFSF/ESM of their role are necessary conditions for our outright transactions to be conducted and to be effective. Details of the Outright Monetary Transactions are described in a separate press release. Furthermore, the Governing Council took decisions with a view to ensuring the availability of adequate collateral in Eurosystem refinancing operations. The details of these measures are also elaborated in a separate press release. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Recently published statistics indicate that euro area real GDP contracted by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2012, following zero growth in the previous quarter. Economic indicators point to continued weak economic activity in the remainder of 2012, in an environment of heightened uncertainty. Looking beyond the short term, we expect the euro area economy to recover only very gradually. The growth momentum is expected to remain dampened by the necessary process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors, the existence of high unemployment and an uneven global recovery. The September 2012 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between -0.6% and -0.2% for 2012 and between -0.4% and 1.4% for 2013. Compared with the June 2012 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges for 2012 and 2013 have been revised downwards. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area are assessed to be on the downside. They relate, in particular, to the tensions in several euro area financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. These risks should be contained by effective action by all euro area policy-makers. Euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.6% in August 2012, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, compared with 2.4% in the previous month. This increase is mainly due to renewed increases in euro-denominated energy prices. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates could turn out somewhat higher than expected a few months ago, but they should decline to below 2% again in the course of next year. Over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain moderate. The September 2012 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 2.4% and 2.6% for 2012 and between 1.3% and 2.5% for 2013. These projection ranges are somewhat higher than those contained in the June 2012 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. Risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be broadly balanced over the medium term. Upside risks pertain to further increases in indirect taxes owing to the need for fiscal consolidation. The main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area, particularly resulting from a further intensification of financial market tensions, and its effects on the domestic components of inflation. If not contained by effective action by all euro area policy-makers, such intensification has the potential to affect the balance of risks on the downside. Turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remained subdued. The annual growth rate of M3 increased to 3.8% in July 2012, up from 3.2% in June. The rise in M3 growth was mainly attributable to a higher preference for liquidity, as reflected in the further increase in the annual growth rate of the narrow monetary aggregate M1 to 4.5% in July, from 3.5% in June. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained weak at 0.5% in July (after 0.3% in June). Annual growth in MFI loans to both non-financial corporations and households remained subdued, at -0.2% and 1.1% respectively (both adjusted for loan sales and securitisation). To a large extent, subdued loan growth reflects a weak outlook for GDP, heightened risk aversion and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises, all of which weigh on credit demand. Furthermore, in a number of euro area countries, the segmentation of financial markets and capital constraints for banks continue to weigh on credit supply. Looking ahead, it is essential for banks to continue to strengthen their resilience where this is needed. The soundness of banks' balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. Although good progress is being made, the need for structural and fiscal adjustment remains significant in many European countries. On the structural side, further swift and decisive product and labour market reforms are required across the euro area to improve competitiveness, increase adjustment capacities and achieve higher sustainable growth rates. These structural reforms will also complement and support fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability. On the fiscal front, it is crucial that governments undertake all measures necessary to achieve their targets for the current and coming years. In this respect, the expected rapid implementation of the fiscal compact should be a main element to help strengthen confidence in the soundness of public finances. Finally, pushing ahead with European institution-building with great determination is essential."
Egypt,2012-09-06,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release September 6, 2012 In its meeting held on September 6, 2012, the Monetary Policy Commi(cid::425)ee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 925 percent and 1025 percent, respec(cid::415)vely, and the 7‐day repo at 975 percen. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 95 percen. While headline CPI inched up by 038 percent (m/m) in July, the annual rate continued on a downward trend reaching 639 percent from 726 percent recorded in the previous mont. Similarly annual core CPI con(cid::415)nued to decline in July, reaching 634 percent down from 704 percent recorded in the previous month despite of the monthly increase of 058 percent (m/m. The latest monthly developments in both headline and core were largely driven by favorable movements in food prices while non‐food prices remained broadly tam. It is important to underscore that if the latest pick up in international food prices prove to be persistent this would pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook along with the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channel. Meanwhile real GDP grew by 52 percent in 2011/2012 Q3, following feeble average growth rates of 035 percent in the first two quarter. This rebound was largely driven by a significant favorable base effect from the respective quarter of 2010/2011 during which economic activity was interrupted following the unfolding political event. During the first three quarters of 2011/2012, real GDP expanded by 18 percent on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction sector which was partly suppressed by continuing weaknesses in the manufacturing and tourism sector. In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants over the past year, investment levels remained lo. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Are. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. Given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks and the uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat Sub Governor.

Malaysia,2012-09-06,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global growth momentum has moderated. Economic activity in most major advanced economies is slower amid greater policy uncertainty while conditions in the international financial markets continue to be volatile. These developments are affecting growth in the rest of the world. In emerging economies including in Asia, domestic demand is showing signs of moderation amid sustained weakness in external activity. While the Malaysian economy is affected by these global developments, domestic demand has continued to support economic growth. Looking ahead, this trend is expected to continue. Private consumption is supported by income growth and stable employment conditions. Investment activity is mainly driven by capital spending in the domestic-oriented industries, the oil and gas sector and the on-going implementation of infrastructure projects. Headline inflation is expected to remain moderate for the remainder of 2012 and into 2013. With some excess capacity in the economy, domestic demand is not expected to result in inflationary conditions. Global energy and commodity prices are likely to be contained given the weak global conditions. However, upside risks to inflation could emerge should supply disruptions result in higher global prices for commodities. In the MPC's assessment, there continues to be considerable uncertainties in the global economic and financial conditions. In this environment, the MPC considers the current stance of monetary policy to be accommodative and supportive of the economy. The MPC will continue to carefully assess these evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy.

Armenia,2012-09-10,"Press Release 09.10.2012 Interest rate unchanged, 8 percent In the October 9th of 2012 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. There was 0.8 percent inflation recorded in September of 2012, and the 12-month inflation remained unchanged, 2.5 percent, which is the lower border of the confidence band. The Board admitted that influences expected from the external sector remain minor inflationary. In spite of further uncertainties over political solutions regarding debt problems in developed countries, global demand is predicted to be weak in the forecast horizon. Yet world markets of food products still see fundamental tightness and slightly inflationary environment due to continued rise in international wheat prices. The impact of the latter on domestic prices was felt over September too, resulting in increased prices in item “bread product”. The impact of developments in the Armenian economy on domestic prices is predicted to be inflationary in the forecast horizon, which is determined by faster growing rates of private consumption and higher-than-expected economic growth rates. The influence of the aforementioned factors on domestic prices will continue to be offset by contractionary impact of the fiscal policy. Though the 12-month inflation maintains closer to the lower border of the band based on the last 9 months' results, in the forecast horizon however some inflationary influences are anticipated from external sector and the Armenian economy on domestic prices. In this circumstance the Board finds it reasonable to keep the refinancing rate at the current level, which will help to bring the 12-month inflation close to the confidence band of 4% +/- 1.5 pp in the forecast horizon. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in the Minutes on Interest Rate due on October 19, 2012. The Central Bank Public Relations."
Philippines,2012-09-12,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 3.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and5.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also maintained accordingly. The reserve requirement ratios were kept steady as well. The Monetary Board's decision was based on its assessment that the inflation environment remains benign, with the risks to the inflation outlook appearing to be broadly balanced. While inflation forecasts have risen slightly due to the higher August inflation and recent increases in global oil and other commodity prices, the future inflation path remains well within the target. Meanwhile, market expectations of inflation remain at levels broadly consistent with the inflation target. Weak global economic prospects continue to temper the inflation outlook, as a possible easing in global demand could contribute to moderate international commodity prices. The sustained stability of the peso against the US dollar could also temper inflationary pressures in the future. Nonetheless, the Monetary Board remains mindful of potential upside risks to the inflation outlook, including pending electricity rate adjustments and expectations of higher foreign prices for some grains due to adverse weather conditions abroad. Moreover, underlying demand-side pressures continue to be firm, supported by ample domestic liquidity and brisk credit activity. On balance, therefore, the Monetary Board is of the view that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriate. This is supported by the manageable inflation outlook and robust domestic growth, especially as the cumulative 75-basis-point reduction in policy rates and other operational adjustments earlier in the year continue to work their way through the economy. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with ensuring stable prices while supporting economic growth."
Chile,2012-09-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 September 2012 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). Internationally, global financial conditions have improved and the financial tensions in the Eurozone have moderated after the announcements of the European Central Bank. However, there is still uncertainty about the region's performance and a resurgence of tensions in coming months cannot be ruled out. Incoming information confirm the outlook of slow growth in developed economies and a deceleration in the main emerging economies. Accordingly, several central banks have taken additional measures of monetary stimulus, where actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve stand out. In international markets the dollar has depreciated, while commodity prices show a rebound in the last month, especially copper and fuels. Domestically, output and demand indicators have evolved around trend. Although employment growth has moderated further and no acceleration of labor costs is observed, the labor market remains tight. The peso has appreciated. Y‐o‐y CPI inflation and core inflation measures remain below 3%. Inflation expectations over the policy horizon remain around the target. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2012-09-13,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.00% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.00% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the economic recovery in the US to have weakened somewhat and the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have deepened. Growth has continued to slow in emerging market countries as well, due mostly to the impact of the economic slumps in advanced countries. The Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be very modest going forward and judges the downside risks to growth to be large, owing chiefly to the spillover of the euro area fiscal crisis to the real economy and to the possibility of the so-called fiscal cliff materializing in the US. In Korea, the Committee appraises economic growth to have been weak, as domestic demand has alternated between improving and worsening and exports have exhibited a downtrend. On the employment front, amid its continued uptrend led by the higher age groups and the service industry, the number of persons employed increased by a greater margin in the manufacturing sector as well. The Committee anticipates that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will be sustained for a considerable time going forward, due mostly to the prolongation of the euro area fiscal crisis and to the sluggishness of the global economy. Consumer price inflation came in low at 1.2% in August, owing primarily to the base effect and to the easing of demand-side pressures, and core inflation which excludes the prices of agricultural and petroleum products also continued to run at a low 1 level at 1.3%. The Committee sees inflation picking up going forward, influenced largely by the recent typhoon damage and the instability of international oil and grain prices, but forecasts that it will remain below the 3.0% midpoint of the inflation target for the time being. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas sustained their downtrend, and those in the rest of the country generally stabilized at their levels of the previous month. In the financial markets, price variables have fluctuated in response mainly to international financial market conditions and to the domestic outlook for economic activity and expectations for monetary policy; stock prices have risen, long-term market interest rates have fallen slightly, and the Korean won exchange rate has fluctuated within a relatively narrow range. Looking ahead, the Committee will closely monitor external risk factors and the consequent changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the inflation target over a medium-term horizon while continuing its efforts to lower inflation expectations and ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded."
United States,2012-09-13,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months. Growth in employment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment appears to have slowed. The housing sector has shown some further signs of improvement, albeit from a depressed level. Inflation has been subdued, although the prices of some key commodities have increased recently. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee is concerned that, without further policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee agreed today to increase policy accommodation by purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month. The Committee also will continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. These actions, which together will increase the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee also decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Dennis P Lockhart; Sandra Pianalto; Jerome H Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Jeremy C Stein; Daniel K Tarullo; John C Williams; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M Lacker, who opposed additional asset purchases and preferred to omit the description of the time period over which exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted.

Peru,2012-09-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2012 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based on that inflation's deviation from the target has reflected transitory supply factors in a domestic context characterized by a level of economic growth close to the economy's potential growth, and in an external context marked by uncertainty in international financial markets, lower terms of trade, and prospects of lower growth in both developed and emerging countries. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider additional adjustments in monetary policy tools. Showing a higher rate than in July, inflation in August registered a monthly rate of 0.51 percent associated mainly with rises in the prices of perishable food products which were affected by adverse domestic climate conditions. As a result of this, the rate of inflation in the last 12 months was 3.5 percent. Core inflation recorded a rate of 0.27 percent in August and thus accumulated a rate of 3.6 percent in the last 12 months, like in the previous month. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.15 percent and an annual rate of 2.4 percent. Unfavorable climate conditions in the major producing countries of grains have temporarily increased the international prices of these commodities. Even though unfavorable local supply conditions in the case of perishable products, such as lemon and onion, have added onto this, inflation is expected to gradually converge to the target range in the rest of the year. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show that the economy's growth has stabilized around its long-term sustainable level of growth, although the indicators associated with the external market register a weak performance. On the other hand, indicators of global economic activity show that uncertainty about the pace of global economic activity has increased. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for October on its session of October 11, 2012."
India,2012-09-17,"Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: September 2012 Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: reduce the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks by 25 basis points from 4.75 per cent to 4.50 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) effective the fortnight beginning September 22, 2012. Consequently, around 170 billion of primary liquidity will be injected into the banking system; and keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 9.0 per cent Introduction 2. There have been several significant developments since the Reserve Bank's First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy in July. Globally, as risks have risen, both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Fed have responded with liquidity measures intended to calm financial markets and provide further stimulus to economic activity. While these measures have certainly mitigated short-term growth and financial risks, they will also exert pressure on global asset prices, and particularly, commodity prices. Domestically, growth continues to be weak amidst a negative investment climate; however, the recent reform measures undertaken by the Government have started to reverse sentiments. The Government undertook long anticipated measures towards fiscal consolidation by reducing fuel subsidies and selling stakes in public enterprises. Further, steps taken to increase foreign direct investment (FDI) should contribute to both greater capital inflows and, over the long run, higher productivity, particularly in the food supply chain. Importantly, however, for the moment, inflationary pressures, both at wholesale and retail levels, are still strong. In April, the Reserve Bank implemented a frontloaded policy rate reduction of 50 basis points on the expectations of fiscal policy support for inflation management alongside supply-side initiatives for addressing the deceleration of investment and growth. As these expectations did not materialise and inflation remained firmly above 7.5 per cent, the Reserve Bank decided to pause in its policy easing in the Mid-2 Quarter Review (MQR) of June and in the First Quarter Review (FQR) of July. As inflationary tendencies have persisted, the primary focus of monetary policy remains the containment of inflation and anchoring of inflation expectations. In this context, the Government's recent actions have paved the way for a more favourable growth- inflation dynamic by initiating a shift in expenditure away from consumption (subsidies) and towards investment (including through FDI). Of course, several challenges remain, one of which is persistent inflation. But, as policy actions to stimulate growth materialize, monetary policy will reinforce the positive impact of these actions while maintaining its focus on inflation management. Only this will ensure that the economy derives the maximum benefit from the recent, and anticipated, fiscal and supply-side policy measures. Global Economy 4. Global activity has been weakening in Q3 of 2012. Merchandise trade slowed considerably with absolute contractions in major economies. Global purchasing managers' indices (PMI) point to contraction in manufacturing and only modest growth in services. Persistent sovereign debt pressures amidst weakening economic activity in the euro area pose significant downside risks to the global economy. These concerns have prompted the announcement of the programme of outright monetary transactions (OMTs) in the form of sovereign bond purchases by the ECB. The US Fed announced the purchase of additional agency mortgage-backed securities until labour market conditions improve substantially, and extended exceptional policy accommodation till mid-2015. Growth in several major emerging and developing economies (EDEs) is also moderating, with China's Q2 2012 growth slowing to its lowest rate in the past three years. Slowing global demand has adversely affected industrial activity and exports in these economies. Additionally, drought conditions in major grain-producing areas of the world and the possibility of further hardening of international crude prices in view of the fresh dose of quantitative easing impart ubiquitous risks to overall global macroeconomic prospects. Domestic Economy Growth 6. Economic activity picked up modestly in Q1 of 2012-13 in relation to the preceding quarter; but the sluggish momentum of value added in Q1 was evident across all sectors of the economy, and particularly in industry. Lead indicators point to slack activity in Q2 as well. Industrial production rose by just 0.1 per cent in July. In August, the manufacturing PMI fell to its lowest level during 2012 so far, as a result of output disruptions due to power shortages and declining export orders. The services PMI, however, picked up in August on growth in new orders and employment. With the progressive reduction in the rainfall deficit, kharif sowing, though still below normal, has improved. Reassuringly, the late rains have augmented storage in reservoirs which should improve prospects for the rabi crop, mitigating to some extent the concerns about agricultural prospects. Inflation 7. Headline WPI inflation (y-o-y) has remained sticky at around 7.5 per cent throughout the current financial year so far. At the disaggregated level, within primary food articles, the easing of vegetable prices in July-August was to a large3 extent offset by the surge in prices of cereals and pulses. Demand-supply imbalances in respect of protein-rich items persist. Fuel price inflation picked up in August, largely reflecting the upward revision in electricity prices. As welcome as the recent hike in diesel prices/rationalisation of LPG subsidy has been, the pass- through to administered prices remains incomplete. International crude prices are vulnerable to being driven up further by global liquidity. Core inflation pressures remained firm with non-food manufactured products inflation inching up from 5.1 per cent in April to 5.6 per cent in August and the momentum indicator remaining elevated. Even as demand pressures moderate, supply constraints and rupee depreciation are imparting pressures on prices, rendering them sticky. In terms of the new CPI, inflation (y-o-y) remained broadly unchanged in July from June at close to 10 per cent, held up by rising prices of food items. Notwithstanding some easing in July, core CPI inflation (CPI excluding food and fuel sub-group) remains elevated. While the recent upward revision in diesel prices and rationalisation of subsidy for LPG is a significant achievement, in the short-term, there will be pressures on headline inflation. Over the medium-term, however, it will strengthen macroeconomic fundamentals. It is important to note that these revisions were anticipated at the time of the April policy when a front-loaded repo rate reduction was undertaken. Over the longer run, holding down subsidies to under 2 per cent of GDP as indicated in the Union Budget for 2012-13 is crucial to manage demand-side pressures on inflation. Containing inflationary pressures and lowering inflation expectations warrant maintaining the momentum of recent policy actions to step up investment, alleviate supply constraints, and improve productivity. Liquidity Conditions 10. Money supply (M ), bank credit and deposits have moderated in relation to 3 their indicative trajectories, reflecting the slowing down of economic activity. Against this backdrop, liquidity conditions have remained comfortable since the FQR. However, going forward, the wedge between deposit growth and credit growth could widen on the back of the seasonal pick-up in credit demand in the second half of the year. This, combined with outflows on account of advance tax payments and the onset of festival-related currency demand, could accentuate pressures on liquidity over the next few weeks. In these conditions, appropriate liquidity management assumes importance in order to ensure that drawals under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) broadly remain within the indicative target of +/- 1 percent of NDTL, thereby facilitating monetary policy transmission and enabling adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors of the economy. External sector 11. While the trade deficit narrowed in the first five months of 2012-13, the relatively large fall of exports in July-August is indicative of risks to the current account from the worsening global outlook. As regards external financing, the moderation in FDI inflows was partly compensated by a surge in non-resident deposits and a renewal of FIIs flows in recent months. Consequently, the rupee has been trading in a narrow range since the FQR. Looking ahead, a moderation in the trade deficit combined with increased inflows in response to domestic policy developments could ease pressures on the balance of payments. However, risks from global factors, in terms of both capital movements and oil prices will persist. Given these external risks, holding down the CAD to sustainable levels will depend4 on durable fiscal consolidation and, in particular, switching public expenditure from subsidies to capital outlay that crowds in private investment, thus preparing the ground for a revival of growth. Guidance 12. Since the FQR, while growth risks have increased, inflation risks remain. Mitigating the growth risks and taking the economy to a higher sustainable growth trajectory requires concerted policy action across a range of domains, a process to which last week's actions made a significant contribution. Monetary policy also has an important role in supporting the growth revival. However, in the current situation, persistent inflationary pressures alongside risks emerging from twin deficits – current account deficit and fiscal deficit - constrain a stronger response of monetary policy to growth risks. Accordingly, as this process evolves, the stance of monetary policy will be conditioned by careful and continuous monitoring of the evolving growth-inflation dynamic, management of liquidity conditions to ensure adequate flows of credit to productive sectors and appropriate responses to shocks emanating from external developments.

Nigeria,2012-09-17,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 85 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of Monday and Tuesday. September 17 and 18, 2012 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on September 17 and 18, 2012, with 10 out of the 12 members in attendance. The Committee reviewed the conditions and challenges that confronted the domestic economy during the first eight months of 2012 against the backdrop of international economic and financial developments with a view to reassessing monetary policy options in the short-to- medium term. The International Economic Developments The Committee noted that the global economy showed signs of further weakness in the last three months, with the latest data not showing any evidence of improvement up to the beginning of the third quarter of 2012. The Committee also observed that the weak growth resulted from considerable financial market fragilities in the euro area with resultant negative spillover effects to other regions, uncertainty resulting from the Eurozone crisis as well as poor 1 macroeconomic performance in other advanced economies. The Committee also observed that the weak 1 growth resulted from considerable financial market fragilities in the euro area with resultant negative spillover effects to other regions, uncertainty resulting from the Eurozone crisis as well as poor macroeconomic performance in other advanced economies. Rising food and energy prices is also a contributory factor. In July 2012 IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) update projected that global output would moderate to 35 per cent in 2012, which is 01 percentage point lower than the forecast of April 2012. Growth in advanced economies was projected to decline from 16 per cent in 2011 to 14 per cent in 2012, with the slowdown being most severe in the peripheral economies, where the dampening effects and uncertainty from tighter financial conditions are strongest. In the US, real GDP grew at an annualized rate of 15 per cent in Q2 of 2012, down by 05 percentage point from 20 per cent in Q1. The sluggish growth was primarily due to declining aggregate consumption, government spending, and negative terms of trade. The euro zone is on the brink of a double-dip recession following the contraction in output between April and June. Real output across the 17-nation bloc fell by 02 per cent in Q2 of 2012 while signs of further contraction are in the horizon. Rising unemployment and large scale fiscal retrenchment coupled with increased taxes in a 2 number of countries constrained aggregate demand leading to cut- back on investment and low export growth. Unemployment level across the zone has attained a record high of 113 per cent, the highest since 1995, with Spain recording the highest level and Austria the least. Weak financial markets and the persisting sovereign debt crisis as well as rising energy prices led the European Central Bank (ECB) to retain its main refinancing interest rate at 075 per cent. EU members remain cautious about the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions scheme, which is based on strict adherence to austerity measures and fiscal consolidation pact. Real output across 2 the 17-nation bloc fell by 02 per cent in Q2 of 2012 while signs of further contraction are in the horizon. Rising unemployment and large scale fiscal retrenchment coupled with increased taxes in a number of countries constrained aggregate demand leading to cut- back on investment and low export growth. In Asia, most economies recorded significant slowdown in economic activity up to Q2 of 2012, mainly on account of weakening exports and investment. Export growth has moderated, reflecting the sluggish demand from Europe while investment remained weak due to heightened volatility of capital flows and the lagged effects of tighter domestic monetary policies. China's real GDP growth slowed to 76 per cent in Q2 from 81 per cent in Q1 due mainly to decline in net exports. Growth moderated in Japan especially in Q3 due to 3 softening in manufacturing activity. India's real GDP, year-on-year, moderated to 55 per cent in Q2 of 2012 from 61 per cent in Q4 of 2011, mainly as a result of deceleration in private consumption. Export growth has moderated, reflecting the sluggish demand from Europe while investment remained weak due to heightened volatility of capital flows and the lagged effects of 3 tighter domestic monetary policies. Growth moderated in Japan especially in Q3 due to softening in manufacturing activity. Overall the growth trajectory for the remainder of the year tends toward a downturn, as downside risks, including weak external demand, elevated price levels, widening twin deficits, falling investments, and rising interest rates, remain heightened. Robust economic activities in the MENA and Sub-Saharan Africa regions would partly offset the declining output growth in the advanced and emerging markets in 2012. Real GDP growth was projected at 50 per cent in each of the regions, underpinned by strong natural resources prices, new natural resources exploration and production in several countries, recovery from drought in the Sahel and parts of Eastern Africa, strong post-conflict recovery in some countries, improved governance practices and growing disposable income. Despite these developments, growth in the regions faces significant downside risks on the back of increased global uncertainties. Real GDP growth was projected at 50 per cent in each of the regions, underpinned by strong natural resources prices, new natural resources exploration and production in several countries, recovery from drought in the Sahel and parts of Eastern Africa, strong post-conflict recovery in some countries, improved governance practices and growing 4 disposable income. The Committee believes that the recent quantitative easing measures by the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve System could be responsible for the high crude oil prices in the international market. It highlighted the possible increase in carry trade and the risk of a bubble in the domestic capital market. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output Recent macroeconomic data indicates that the economy is performing better than forecasts although growth in the first two quarters of 2012 has remained consistently below the corresponding growth rates in 2011. The provisional real GDP growth rate from the National Bureau of Statistics stood at 628 per cent in Q2 of 2012, up from 617 per cent in Q1 2012 but lower than the 761 per cent recorded in the corresponding period of 2011. The non-oil sector remained the major driver of growth recording a 750 per cent increase in contrast to the oil sector, which contracted by 073 per cent during the period. Overall GDP growth for fiscal 2012 has been revised upwards to 677 per cent from the earlier projection of 650 5 per cent. The Committee welcomed the promising growth performance although it expressed concern that the overall output growth projection for 2012 is still lower than the 745 per cent recorded in 2011. The non-oil sector 5 remained the major driver of growth recording a 750 per cent increase in contrast to the oil sector, which contracted by 073 per cent during the period. Overall GDP growth for fiscal 2012 has been revised upwards to 677 per cent from the earlier projection of 650 per cent. The growth drivers within the non-oil sector remained agriculture; wholesale and retail trade; and services; which contributed 194, 169, and 316 per cent, respectively. The Committee noted that the relatively robust growth projections despite the slowing global economy reflected the continuing favorable conditions for increased agricultural production, improved security situation and power supply. Prices The Committee observed that the inflationary pressures experienced during the first half of 2012 appear to be moderating in the third quarter. The year-on-year headline inflation declined to 117 per cent in August 2012 from 128 per cent in July while core inflation decelerated to 147 from 150 per cent during the same period. Also food inflation declined sharply to 99 per cent in August 2012 from 6 121 per cent in July. The significant decline in year-on-year food inflation was attributed to the decrease in prices of both processed foods (from 42 to 36 per cent) and farm produce (from 79 to 64 per cent). The Committee observed that the inflationary pressures from the partial removal of petroleum subsidy in January, 2012 appear to have waned in Q3, 2012, and that given the relatively stable exchange rate regime, the pass-through to domestic prices was low during the period. The Committee, however, recognized the upside risk to inflation in the near-term to include increased spending in the fourth quarter and monetized capital flows following the US QE3. Prices The Committee observed that the inflationary pressures experienced during the first half of 2012 appear to be moderating in the third 6 quarter. Also food inflation declined sharply to 99 per cent in August 2012 from 121 per cent in July. The significant decline in year-on-year food inflation was attributed to the decrease prices of both processed foods (from 42 to 36 per cent) and farm produce (from 79 to 64 per cent). Monetary Credit and Financial Markets' Developments Broad money supply (M2) grew by 350 per cent in August 2012 over the level at end-December, 2011, which annualized to 525 per cent. The annualized growth rate is significantly lower than the growth rate of 1543 per cent recorded in 2011. Aggregate domestic credit (net) declined by 382 per cent in August 2012, annualized to a decline of 573 per cent from the level at end-December 2011 level. The 7 decline in aggregate domestic credit (net) in August 2012 was due to a huge fall in credit to Government (net), which declined by 24647 per cent or 36971 per cent on annualized basis. This development reflected the combined effects of the significant growth in Federal Government deposits with the banking system and contraction on claims to government. The introduction of a Treasury Single Account (TSA) appeared to have had the desired effect of reducing government borrowing. The decline in aggregate domestic credit (net) in August 2012 was due to a huge fall in credit to Government (net), which declined by 24647 per cent or 36971 per cent on annualized basis. Interest rates in all segments of the money markets rose initially, in response to the increase in the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) by 400 basis points at the MPC meeting of July 23 and 24, 2012. The rates, however, trended downwards toward the end of the review period. The inter-bank call and OBB rates, which opened at 1785 and 1499 per cent, closed at 1419 and 1356 per cent, respectively, during the review period. Developments in the interest rate structure indicated that the retail lending rates remained high in August 2012. Interest rates in all segments of the money markets rose initially, in response to the increase in the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) by 400 basis points at the MPC meeting of July 21 and 22, 2012. The inter-bank call and OBB rates, which opened at 1785 and 1499 per cent, closed at 1419 and 1356 per cent, respectively, 8 during the review period. The average maximum lending rate increased marginally to 2376 per cent in August 2012 from 2345 per cent in July. However the 8 average interest bearing deposit rate declined to 624 per cent in August 2012 from 664 per cent in July. Thus the spread between the average maximum lending rate and the average interest-bearing deposit rate widened to 1753 per cent in August 2012 from 1681 per cent in July. The Committee expressed concerns that lending rates have remained high and enjoined the Bank to sustain its efforts towards the reduction in interest rate spread, while stabilizing interbank rates to sustain liquidity and facilitate intermediation in the banking system. The Committee noted that this can only be achieved by sustaining the current efforts at reducing overheads in the banking industry and deepening capital market reforms to diversify sources of finance for the real economy, and complement bank loans. However the average interest bearing deposit rate declined to 624 per cent in August 2012 from 664 per cent in July. The Committee observed that the recovery in the Nigerian capital market continued during the review period, as equities market indicators were positive. The All-Share Index (ASI) increased by 996 per cent between June 29, 2012 and August 31, 2012, while Market Capitalization (MC) increased by 964 per cent during the same 9 period. Equity Market Median PE ratios at 986 in August 2012, fell below the long-run median of 1077 by 091 or 844 per cent, suggesting bargain valuations and an imminent rebound. The Committee observed that the performance of the NSE during the period was consistent with the global trends, especially in the wake of monetary expansion. The All-Share Index (ASI) increased by 996 per cent between June 29, 2012 and August 31, 2012, while Market Capitalization (MC) increased by 964 per cent during the same period. External Sector Developments At the Wholesale Dutch Auction System (WDAS), the exchange rate during the period. July 25 – August 31, 2012, opened at N15740/US$ and closed at N15736/US$, representing an appreciation of N004k. The appreciation was due to the combined effects of the increase in Cash Reserve Requirement, reduction in the Net open position and the policy barring DMBs/Discount Houses from accessing Lending windows (SLF and Repo) and WDAS simultaneously. At the interbank segment, the selling rate opened at N16005/US$ and closed at N15815/US$, representing an appreciation of N190 or 001 per cent. The appreciation was due to the combined effects of the increase in Cash Reserve Requirement, reduction in the Net open position and the policy barring DMBs/Discount Houses from accessing Lending 10 windows (SLF and Repo) and WDAS simultaneously. The appreciation experienced in this segment was due to increased supply of foreign exchange by oil companies to the interbank 10 market. At the BDC segment of the foreign exchange market, the selling rate opened at N16300/US$ and closed at N16100/US$, representing an appreciation of N200k or 001 per cent for the period. The appreciation recorded in this segment was traced to the low demand of foreign exchange by end users vis-à-vis the high supply of foreign exchange at the interbank market and the apparent taming of speculative activities. The appreciation experienced in this segment was due to increased supply of foreign exchange by oil companies to the interbank market. The Committee noted with satisfaction that the premia between the rates at the WDAS and the interbank; and between the wDAS and the BDCs; narrowed towards the end of the review period, and therefore encouraged the Bank to sustain and complement existing measures to discourage speculative demand in the market. In general, the Committee noted that the decisions taken at the last meeting of the MPC had produced the desired result. In 11 general, the Committee noted that the decisions taken at the last meeting of the MPC had produced the desired result. In the same vein, the Committee expressed satisfaction with the significant accretion to external reserves during the period. Gross external reserves as at September 5, 2012 stood at US$ 4181 billion, representing an increase of US$ 640 billion or 1807 per cent above 11 the level of US$3541 billion at end-June 2012. External reserves increased by US$ 888 billion or 270 per cent on a year-on-year basis compared with US$ 3293 billion at end- August 2011. The increase in the reserve level was driven mainly by proceeds from crude oil and gas sales and crude oil related taxes. The foreign reserves level could finance over seven months of imports. Gross external reserves as at September 5, 2012 stood at US$ 4181 billion, representing an increase of US$ 640 billion or 1807 per cent above the level of US$3541 billion at end-June 2012. The Committee's Considerations Given developments in the global and domestic economy and the financial markets, the Committee noted that the weak global growth indices called for cautious optimism by policymakers. The resolution of the euro area debt crises remains a major concern even with the approval of the efforts of the European Central Bank to address the debt crises in the euro area by the German Constitutional Court. It further noted that its decisions at the July MPC Meeting appeared to have had some positive impact in a number of areas, namely: a deceleration in year-on-year inflation in August 2012, stability of short term interest rates around the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), buildup in external reserves and stability in the 12 exchange rate. However core inflation is still high at 147 per cent in August. The threat of increased inflow of hot money arising from the actions of the US Fed to further stimulate the economy through its QE3 activities and its capital reversal implications were noted. The resolution of the euro area debt crises remains a major concern even with the approval of the efforts of the European Central Bank 12 to address the debt crises in the euro area by the German Constitutional Court. It further noted that its decisions at the July MPC Meeting appeared to have had some positive impact in a number of areas, namely: a deceleration in year-on-year inflation in August 2012, stability of short term interest rates around the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), buildup in external reserves and stability in the exchange rate. The Committee noted the rise in oil prices but cautioned against a hasty deployment of the windfall to immediate consumption as the trend could be reversed. Monetary policy could not, therefore, under the circumstance, react to what may be purely temporary developments. Despite the threats from a combination of global and domestic factors, the Committee noted that the level of economic growth in the third quarter of 2012 remained robust and the year-end forecast would likely be met owing largely to the improvements in power supply and the steady progress of reforms, actions in respect of the alleged fraud in the petroleum subsidy regime and improved fiscal operations. The Committee noted that these measures, generally take time to impact the real economy. Despite the threats from a combination of global and domestic factors, the Committee noted that the level of economic growth in the third quarter of 2012 remained robust and the year-end forecast 13 would likely be met owing largely to the improvements in power supply and the steady progress of reforms, actions in respect of the alleged fraud in the petroleum subsidy regime and improved fiscal operations. 13 With this development, the Committee observed that the inflation outcome for the remaining period of the year is likely to be lower than the initial forecast of 147 per cent. The Committee would continue to monitor developments in the price level, and remain firm in its commitment to price stability as its mandate. The Committee also noted that the growth rate of real output, though impressive by global trends, was on the downward trend since Q1 2010 most especially in the agricultural sector. It was of concern to the Committee that the declining output in the agricultural sector was traceable to the security challenges and high intensity of rainfall which has led to flooding in several parts of the country. It noted that the measures taken at the last MPC meeting have succeeded in stabilizing the foreign exchange market as well as enhancing the build up in external reserves. With this development, the Committee observed that the inflation outcome for the remaining period of the year is likely to be lower than the initial forecast of 147 per cent. It noted that the measures taken at the last MPC meeting have succeeded in 14 stabilizing the foreign exchange market as well as enhancing the build up in external reserves. Overall the MPC believes that the current rise in crude oil prices and the tight monetary policy regime presented an opportunity for building reserve buffers in the light of the uncertainties surrounding the global economy. 14 The Committee, therefore, identified the key policy challenges to include: 1. Protecting the domestic economy and building external reserves buffer; 2. Potential large inflow of “hot money” resulting from further monetary easing in the US and Europe and improved yield on fixed income instruments; 3. Persisting high core inflation rates; The Committee noted that this moderation in headline inflation has not been accompanied by a significant decline in core inflation. The Committee, therefore, identified the key policy challenges to include: 1. Given the unpredictability of food prices, there is a need to watch this trend as we approach year-end before altering the present monetary stance. Given the unpredictability of food prices, there is a need to watch 15 this trend as we approach year-end before altering the present monetary stance. Decisions In view of the foregoing, the Committee by a unanimous vote decided as follows: 15 1. Retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 12 per cent with +/- 200 basis points corridor; 2. Retain the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) at 120 per cent. Decisions In view of the foregoing, the Committee by a unanimous vote decided as follows: 1. Retain the Net Open Position at 10 per cent. Thank you. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria 18th September, 2012 16 PERSONAL STATEMENTS BY MPC MEMBERS: 10 ALADE. SARAH Headline inflation decreased to 117percent in August from 128 percent recorded in July. This decline is driven generally by decrease in food inflation which dropped to 99 in August from 121 recorded in the previous month, as the harvest season commenced. In the international scene, while growth prospects remain subdued, the announcement by the Federal Reserve of third round of Quantitative Easing measures and effort by the Eurozone ministers to tackle the Euro area debt problems all point to positive developments. On the domestic front, second quarter GDP growth remain robust at 628 percent although lower than recorded at the corresponding period of the previous year. Inflation is on a downward trend and international oil prices remain stable. Monetary policy should adopt a gradual approach to monitor the channel of transmissions of the events in the Euro area and the US in the coming months before taking further actions. Based on this. I will support a no change in monetary policy rate and Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR). Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria 18th September, 2012 16. Headline inflation dropped to 117 percent in August from 128 percent recorded in the previous month. Domestic inflation has continued to trend down after a persistent and sustained inflationary pressure, beating most analysts' expectation. This can be mainly attributable to the commencement of harvest which resulted in the availability of locally produced food products at lower rate. Staff projections suggest a 17 temporary easing in inflation for the next two months during the peak of the harvest season before edging up again by the end of the year. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is revised upwards and is projected to grow by 677 percent in 2012. Second quarter GDP growth edged up to 628 percent an increased from the 617 percent recorded in the first quarter of the year. The non-oil sector remained the major driver of growth recording 750 per cent increase in contrast to the oil sector which contracted by 024 per cent during the same period, with agriculture, wholesale and retail trade, and services as the major contributors. In the money market, rates responded to the decisions taken at the last MPC meeting. Inter-bank call and OBB rates which averaged around 1520 and 1472 percent respectively, before the last MPC, lowered to an average of 1399 and 1299 percent respectively during the month of September. The decrease in the OBB and inter-bank rates can be attributed more to the last monetary policy decisions which increase the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) by 400 basis points. In the Nigerian stock exchange, activities remain bearish as a result of domestic confidence in the market. Policy decision at the last MPC resulted in stability at the foreign exchange market and buildup of reserve. The additional measures introduced at the last MPC, brought stability at the foreign exchange market and reduced speculative demand. The decision also aided capital inflows to the 18 economy, resulting in buildup of foreign exchange reserves. The impact of the Federal Reserve quantitative easing measures, could further increase capital inflows into the economy as capital go after high interest rate. The global economic environment remains fragile and weak and needs to be closely monitored. Events in the economies of Nigeria's trading partners remain weak and if this condition persists could lead to a softening in demand for and price of oil with negative impact for oil revenues. While oil prices have remained high and stable, the supply side factors such as geo-political tension in the Middle East (Iran) that is driving the price increase may soften in the medium term. The fallout will be the reduction in foreign exchange earnings, weakening of the naira, and pressure on exchange rate. This may further lead to increase budget deficit and public sector borrowing to finance the expenditure outlays. Therefore it is important that a tight monetary stance is maintained to forestall major downside risk to the economy. Based on the above. I am inclined to tilt my decision to balance both global risks and national vulnerabilities. Consequently I will support a no increase in monetary policy rate and Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR). 19 20 BARAU. SULEIMAN A Review of developments since the last MPC A1 The following developments very clearly reveal that the various measures taken as part of overall tightening stance on policy have produced expected results;  Year on Year (YoY) Headline Inflation (HI) trended down from 1280% (July) to 1169% (August). Month on Month (MoM) HI has however, increased by 024% to 067%, respectively. YoY Food Inflation (FI) has decreased from 1209 (July) to 991% (August). MoM (FI) increased from 031 (July) to 072% (August). Core Inflation (CI) similarly declined from 1504% (July) to 1471% (August). MoM Core Inflation however, increased from 011% (July) to 062% in August. The Naira appreciated in all segments of the foreign exchange market. In addition, the premium between WDAS and BDC rates narrowed to 169%. External reserves peaked at a two year record of US$4213 billion. Money market rates have stabilized after the expected initial volatility. 20 A2 Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew marginally from 617 in quarter one (Q1) to 628% in (Q2). However this is a decline when compared to 761% recorded in Q2 2011. .3 Financial markets in some of the Euro Zone countries continued to be volatile following the sovereign debt crises. Meanwhile we continue to witness slow growth in China and other emerging market economies. Discussion/Pressure Points  The successive tightening measures we have taken recently have very clearly produced the desired results. The issue facing the MPC today is whether in the light of this development, we should hold tighten or loosen the stance in policy. In the first place, even though we were not operating an inflation targeting framework, the MPC has expressed the desire to bring inflation to single digit. At 117% the YoY Headline Inflation though far below forecast is in the double digit arena. Besides both the MoM Inflation measures and outlook indicate upside risk. In addition, as we move towards fiscal year end, public and consumer spending due to festivities could increase, which largely support this outlook. We have witnessed appreciation in all segments of the foreign exchange market. While our objective is to allow the exchange 21 rate to be mobile within a target band, it is significant to observe that the forces that have tended to put pressure on the Naira recently are speculative rather than fundamental. These forces have been supported by the observed huge liquidity in the system driven by substantial government spending. This makes a compelling case for continuation of the current policy stance. The substantial accretion to our foreign reserves is a very good development. This has changed market sentiment and has supported the recent appreciation of the Naira. The pass- through effect of exchange rate on inflation makes it an important variable in our inflation management equation. This supports our argument in favour of the maintenance of current policy stance. After the initial shock in the money market rates have largely stabilized following the measures taken at the last MPC meeting. There is the need to maintain the stability. Decision In the light of the need to maintain stability in the money and foreign exchange markets, the upside risk to inflation and the need to sustain accretion to reserves. I voted in favour of maintaining the measures taken at the last MPC as follows:  Maintain MPR at 12% 22  Maintain the corridor at plus and minus 2% around the MPR (for SLF and SDP, respectively)  Maintain the Net Open Limit for Banks at 1%  Maintain CRR at 12% 30 GARBA. ABDUL-GANIYU General Observation 1. The timely implementation of the decisions on CRR (from 8% to 12%). Net Foreign Exchange Open Position (NOP) [from 3% to 1% with effect from July 24th, 2012] and the circulars that changed the arbitrage game have helped to significantly (a) moderate the pressures on the Naira and (b) put economic players on notice that a new era of creative rationality and creative mix of policies and institutional changes has begun in the MPC. The forward looking actions by the MPIC in the first two weeks after the July MPC is also highly commendable: it helped to achieve the desired result which was to change the game and align choices open to players and associated payoffs to national macroeconomic goals. It very important that forward looking actions are sustained. Outstanding Structural and Institutional Issues Pre-dating Last MPC 3. The slowing growth from 1st quarter of 2010; the high unemployment (239% and average of 18 million adding to the 23 pool each year); high poverty rates (1125 Million in 2011) and the insecurities that have heightened uncertainties and risks. Destructive rationalism in the financial system linked to perverse incentives and manifesting in high costs, rent appropriation and allocative inefficiencies, exposures of DMBs to FGN Bonds; high market concentration (deposit, credit and capital) and;; the crowding-out of credit to the real sector. Weak institutions that embed the perverse incentives. Unsustainable growth in public debt, public debt service and high opportunity costs of current structures of public expenditures. Trends and structures of the money survey in the first three quarters of 2012: aThe M1 and Net Domestic Credit (NDC) have trended downwards in the first eight months with average monthly growths of -36% and -20% respectively. These have adverse effects on private investments and growth. .In contrast. Net Foreign Assets (NFA) grown at an average monthly rate of 69% which is good for accumulation of foreign reserves. It would seem that the increase in NFA is neutralized by a combination of decline in M1 and NDC . The neutralization of the positive growth of NFA is necessary to complement the tight monetary policy of the MPC. But it comes at a cost: higher interest rates and negative growth of NDC. It may be 24 important to quantify the opportunity costs in terms of forgone investment, employment and growth. .The three components of Quasi Money (QM) –Savings Deposit (SD); Time Deposit (TD) and Foreign Currency Deposit (FCD) have shown different patterns of growth. On average Savings Deposit averaged 07% growth between January to August 2012 compared to 17% for Time Deposit and 33% for Foreign Currency Deposit. After the last MPC in July. FCD rose sharply by 174% and TD rose by 59% while SD fell by -02%. It is important to look more closely at the trend and structure of the money survey to ensure consistency with macroeconomic goals. Outlook Inflation and Global Economic Challenges and Policy Responses 8. Headline inflation trended downwards from 15% in April 2010 to 93% in August 2011 and 103% at end of 2011. However the two supply shocks of 2012 (rise in PMS in January and electricit"
Turkiye,2012-09-18,"b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been kept at 5 percent while lending rate has been cut from 11.5 percent to 10 percent. Interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been cut from 11 percent to 9.5 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been cut from 14.5 percent to 13 percent. Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand continues as envisaged. As of the third quarter, domestic demand follows a moderate pace, while exports continue to increase despite the weakening global outlook. Overall, aggregate demand conditions support disinflation and current account deficit continues to improve gradually. The Committee expects the fall in inflation to become more evident during the last quarter of the year. However, given the recent increases in energy prices and given that inflation will continue to stay above the target for some time, a cautious stance regarding pricing behavior is warranted. Although the risk appetite has improved in financial markets due to recent developments, ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy necessitate the monetary policy to remain flexible on both sides. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. The Committee has stated that increasing the reserve option coefficients and narrowing the interest rate corridor would support financial stability. If deemed necessary, a measured step in the same direction may be taken in the forthcoming period. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2012-09-20,"Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the global growth outlook has weakened further. However, the near-term risks to global financial markets arising from the Eurozone debt crisis seem to have subsided somewhat following the announcement of the bond purchase programme by the ECB. While this appears to be a positive step, significant risks still remain. At the same time the global environment has been impacted by further monetary easing in the US and Japan. Domestically, inflation continued to surprise on the downside although it appears that the short-term low point could have been reached. Despite a number of upside supply side risks, inflation is expected to remain contained within the target range over the forecast period. The growth outlook, however, has deteriorated somewhat in response to both domestic and global developments. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 5,0 per cent in August 2012, up from 4,9 per cent in July. The categories of food, housing and utilities, and transport together accounted for 3,0 percentage points of the inflation outcome. Food prices increased by 5,1 per cent, petrol by 9,3 per cent and electricity by 10,0 per cent. Core inflation, as measured by the exclusion of food, petrol and electricity from CPI measured 4,6 per cent, up from 4,5 per cent in July. Administered prices excluding petrol increased at a year-on-year rate of 7,5 per cent. Year-on-year producer price inflation moderated to 5,4 per cent in July, having measured 6,6 per cent in each of the previous three months. A reversal in the downward trend in food price inflation was observed, although still at relatively low levels, with agricultural prices increasing at a year-on-year rate of 3,0 per cent in July, compared with a recent low of 1,7 per cent in May and 2,2 per cent in June. Manufactured food prices increased by 7,7 per cent and 8,0 per cent in June and July respectively. The inflation forecast of the Bank reflects a moderate deterioration for 2013 compared with the previous forecast, and a relatively flat trajectory over the entire forecast period. Inflation is now expected to average 5,3 per cent in the final quarter of 2012, 5,2 per cent in 2013, and 5,0 per cent in 2014. The near-term deterioration is mainly due to higher expected petrol and food inflation. Core inflation appears to be well contained with a peak of 4,9 per cent expected in the final quarter of 2012, compared with the previous forecast peak of 5,4 per cent. This measure is now expected to average 4,6 per cent in both 2013 and 2014. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University in the third quarter of 2012 were again virtually unchanged, particularly for 2013 and 2014, and remain anchored at around the upper end of the target range. Respondents expect inflation to average 5,8 per cent in 2012 and 6,0 per cent and 6,2 per cent in 2013 and 2014 respectively. There is, however, a divergence of views between the respondents: while all categories of respondents expect average inflation to be within the target range in 2012, trade union officials and business executives expect it to exceed the upper end of the target range in both of the following two years. This is in contrast to financial analysts who expect inflation to average just over 5 per cent in both of these years. The survey conducted by Reuters indicates that market analysts expect inflation to average 5,3 per cent in 2013 and 5,4 per cent in 2014. Market expectations as reflected in the break-even inflation rates initially increased after the previous meeting of the MPC, but have since declined somewhat. Expectations over the various maturities continue to reflect expectations of inflation within the target range. The global growth outlook remains weak, notwithstanding significant policy initiatives announced by the US Fed, the ECB and Bank of Japan, and the initial positive reaction from global financial markets. The decision by the Fed to engage in a further round of quantitative easing was prompted by an assessment that the expected growth trajectory was not strong enough to generate a sustained improvement in the labour market. The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 1,7 per cent in the second quarter of 2012, and the outlook is clouded by the risk of a severe fiscal contraction early next year. The outcome of the US elections in November will be critical in determining the prospects for a favourable resolution of this “fiscal cliff”. In the meantime the attendant risks have had an adverse impact on investment expenditure in the US and various indicators of industrial output point to a subdued growth outlook. In the Eurozone, the immediate risks posed by the continuing debt crisis appear to have abated somewhat with the announcement by the ECB of its Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) or bond purchase programme. In addition, two important event risks were also avoided following the decision of the federal constitutional court in Germany to uphold the ratification of the treaty to establish the European Stability Mechanism, although under specific conditions, and the pro-euro outcome of the Dutch election. The precise workings of the OMT, particularly the issues relating to conditionality, are still uncertain, but the initiative has bought some time to implement more permanent solutions. Despite this potential progress, the risk of a Greek exit from the Eurozone remains, and growth prospects in the region have deteriorated following the overall contraction in the second quarter of this year, continued bank deleveraging and a further decline in cross-border lending. The UK economy has contracted for three consecutive quarters, while Japanese economic growth also moderated markedly in the second quarter. The impact of the US actions on the Japanese yen prompted a surprise increase of ¥10 trillion by the Bank of Japan in the size of its asset purchase programme. Although the yen depreciated in response, the impact appears to have been short-lived. Growth momentum is also somewhat weaker in some of the systemically important emerging market economies, particularly in China. Brazil and India, in the face of weakening external demand. A number of countries have responded by easing monetary policy and, as in the case of Brazil, by introducing measures to stimulate domestic demand and competitiveness. Global inflation remains relatively benign given the weak demand, but supply side shocks in the form of higher food prices, due to droughts in the US and some parts of eastern Europe, and resilient international crude oil prices pose a risk to the outlook. Both of these shocks are not only a risk to inflation but could also represent an additional drag on near-term growth, a combination that poses enormous challenges to monetary policy. The rand exchange rate has fluctuated generally within a range of R8.10 and R8.50 against the US dollar since May, and continues to be affected by changing risk perceptions in global financial markets. More recently the rand appears to have decoupled from the euro and reacted to domestic issues, including the wider-than-expected current account deficit, and developments in parts of the mining sector following the tragic events at Marikana. The rand has, however, been underpinned to some extent by continued inflows into the domestic bond markets in the lead-up to South Africa's inclusion in the Citibank World Government Bond Index (WGBI). Non-resident purchases of South African bonds have amounted to R12,1 billion since the previous meeting of the MPC, and R74,5 since the beginning of the year. These inflows are expected to persist for some time as non-resident portfolios adjust to the WGBI inclusion. Although the rand, along with most other currencies, initially appreciated against the dollar following the announcement of further quantitative easing by the US Fed, it depreciated against the euro following the positive response to the announcement of the OMT. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the rand has depreciated by about 2,4 per cent against the dollar, by 7,5 per cent against the euro and by 5,0 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. Over this period the dollar depreciated by 5,5 per cent against the euro. The current account of the balance of payments has emerged as a risk to the exchange rate outlook following the widening of the deficit to 6,4 per cent of GDP in the second quarter. The Bank's forecast for the current account in 2012 is for a deficit in the order of 5¼ per cent of GDP. This widening deficit is a consequence of declining commodity exports and increased imports and service payments. The current account deficit has been financed mainly through portfolio inflows, but could pose a risk to the exchange rate unless it moderates over the coming months. The domestic economic growth outlook remains constrained by the weak global outlook and by recent work stoppages in the mining sector. The economy recorded a growth rate of 3,2 per cent in the second quarter of 2012, but this reflects a distortion arising from the strong contribution from the mining sector which recovered from a deep contraction in the first quarter. Non-mining real output growth measured 1,7 per cent, due in large part to negative growth in the manufacturing sector. The leading indicator of the Reserve Bank has declined for four consecutive months, and the Bank's growth forecasts have been revised down. Real GDP growth is now expected to average 2,6 per cent in 2012 and 3,4 per cent in 2013, compared with 2,7 per cent and 3,8 per cent in the previous forecasts. Notwithstanding these downward revisions, the Bank sees further risks to the downside. Recent high frequency data point to a lacklustre growth performance in the third quarter. Mining output contracted by 1,5 per cent in July compared with June and the impact of the recent strikes in the mining sector is yet to be reflected in the data. The physical volume of manufacturing production contracted by 1,1 per cent on a month-on-month basis in July, while the year-on-year increase of 5,8 per cent was exaggerated by weak base effects. The Kagiso PMI, which has been moderating consistently since February, declined further in August and remains marginally above the neutral level of 50. The FNB/BER Business Confidence Index improved in the third quarter following the sharp decline in the second quarter, but remained below the neutral level. The survey reflected very negative sentiment amongst manufacturers and building contractors, while the vehicle trade exhibited high and rising levels of confidence, as reflected in robust vehicle sales. The real value of building plans passed declined in June and July after a tentative recovery in the previous two months. While positive growth was observed in the non-residential sector up to June, building activity in the residential sector remains subdued, indicative of the weak housing market. By contrast, confidence in the civil construction index has improved, in line with increased civil construction activity. Growth in gross fixed capital formation increased to 5,7 per cent, contributing 1,2 percentage points to overall GDP growth. Private sector investment remains weak, with annualised growth rates of 1,8 per cent, and 2,4 per cent in the first and second quarters of 2012. By contrast, fixed capital formation by public corporations grew at an annualised rate of 9,1 per cent in the second quarter. Formal sector employment growth has remained weak. According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics (QES) released by Statistics South Africa, employment growth over four quarters to the second quarter of 2012 measured 1,5 per cent. This represents an increase of 123,300 jobs, one third of which were in the public sector. Although the current level of formal sector employment is still about 60,000 less than that attained before the onset of the crisis, the trend remains positive even if too slow. Final consumption expenditure by households was again the main contributor to GDP growth, contributing 1,9 percentage points. Nevertheless, expenditure growth moderated to 2,9 per cent in the second quarter, mainly due to the contraction in real outlays on services. Expenditure on goods, particularly durable and semi-durable goods, remained robust. Retail sales also grew at a more moderate year-on-year rate of 4,2 per cent in July. Despite the decline in total new vehicle sales in August, the positive momentum in this sector seems to have been sustained, although exports to Europe are expected to remain under pressure. The FNB/BER consumer confidence index increased marginally in the third quarter following a large decline in the second quarter, but remains at a low level. At these levels consumption expenditure is not seen to pose a risk to the inflation outlook. Following a recent high in March 2012, growth in credit extension to the private sector has moderated. Twelve-month growth in banks' total loans and advances declined from 9,2 per cent in March, to 8,1 per cent and 7,3 per cent in June and July respectively. Credit extension to the household sector increased at a rate of 8,1 per cent in July, while credit extended to the corporate sector eased somewhat. Mortgage loans remained subdued, while instalment sale credit and leasing finance reflected the robust vehicle sales. Growth in general loans to households, which is mainly unsecured lending, accelerated to 32,8 per cent in July, but was still below the peak growth of 39,3 per cent experienced in June 2011. Growth in unsecured lending to companies moderated to 8,3 per cent in July, from a recent high of 16,1 per cent recorded in March. The continued high rates of unsecured lending have contributed to rising household debt, with the ratio of household debt to disposable income increasing from 75,6 per cent to 76,3 per cent between the first and second quarters of 2012. There is no evidence that unsecured lending has had an adverse impact on the asset quality of the banking sector, as impaired advances as a percentage of gross loans and advances measured 4,4 per cent in July compared with 5,5 per cent a year earlier. The trends in wage growth have been relatively benign from an inflation perspective. Measured over four quarters, nominal unit labour cost growth was 6,1 per cent in both of the first two quarters of 2012. According to Andrew Levy Employment publications, the overall wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements amounted to 7,7 per cent in the first half of 2012, while the public sector settled on an increase of 7,0 per cent. However, there is a risk that the recent wage settlements in the mining sector could set a precedent for wage demands more generally. Food and petrol prices are the main upside risks to the inflation outlook. Following a sharp spike in July, global grain prices stabilised and then moderated, but remain at elevated levels. Futures prices indicate an expectation that these prices may have stabilised and may subside in the medium term. Domestic spot prices of maize and wheat followed global trends, having increased by about 40 per cent and 20 per cent respectively between the beginning of June and the end of July. These increases are expected to filter through to domestic consumer prices in the coming months. The price of Brent crude oil continued its recent upward trend, reaching around US$117 per barrel on 14 September, or US$12 per barrel higher than at the time of the previous MPC meeting. However the Saudi Arabian government commitment to increase the supply of oil has elicited a price response with oil prices declining to current levels of around US$108 per barrel. How sustainable this impact will be remains to be seen, given the geo-political factors prevailing in the Middle East. The domestic price of petrol has increased significantly as a result, largely offsetting the recent price decreases. Since August, the price of petrol has increased by a cumulative R1,15 per litre, and a further increase is expected in October. The MPC remains concerned about the risks posed to the domestic economy from the global environment. The actions of the ECB appear to have reduced immediate liquidity concerns in the region and have had a positive impact on sentiment. The continued risk of a possible Greek exit and its contagion effects are likely to hang over the markets for some time. The fundamental problems of the Eurozone remain, and low or negative growth is likely to persist going forward. Despite renewed stimulus in the United States, growth is expected to remain subdued at least until the “fiscal cliff” issue is resolved. This negative global outlook, which is reinforced by a slowdown in Asia, poses a downside risk to the domestic growth prospects, particularly in the form of a weaker export performance. The domestic outlook is also likely to be constrained by local developments, particularly in the mining sector, which have the potential to undermine the already fragile private sector investment sentiment despite the accommodative macroeconomic policy environment. While the Bank's forecast for growth has been revised down, the MPC assesses that further risks are somewhat on the downside. Recent inflation outcomes have been more or less in line with the Bank's expectations, but some upside pressure is still expected from food and petrol price increases. Demand pressures are, however, expected to remain benign. The exchange rate poses a potential risk to the inflation outlook, particularly in the event of an unsustainable widening of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments. To date the rand has remained relatively resilient. The committee assesses the risks to the inflation forecast to be more or less balanced. At its previous meeting the MPC assessed that conditions justified a pre-emptive loosening of the monetary policy stance. Although global and domestic growth conditions remain challenging, the MPC is of the view that a further reduction in the repurchase rate is not appropriate at this stage. The MPC has therefore decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,0 per cent per annum. This accommodative stance is assessed to be consistent with the Bank's price stability mandate, and conducive to encouraging growth and domestic investment. Further actions going forward will be highly dependent on global and domestic developments that may change the risks to the outlook."
Israel,2012-09-24,"Following the publication of the August CPI, which surprised to the upside, the rate of inflation measured over the previous 12 months increased to 1.9 percent, from 1.4 percent. Supply side factors: taxes, and prices of oil and other commodities: affected the August CPI and are expected to be reflected in relatively high CPI readings in coming months as well. With that, inflation expectations for the coming 12 months, based on various sources, were stable after they increased last month. This month, the Research Department revised its growth forecast for the economy to 3.3 percent for 2012, and to 3 percent for 2013. These forecasts, together with other indicators which became available this month, point to continued growth at a rate similar to that in the first half of the year. With that, expectations seen in consumer surveys and the Business Tendency Survey are for additional moderation in activity. Home prices, as measured over the past 12 months, remained stable this month as well. However, the change in home prices in the past month, the number of home purchase transactions, and new mortgages granted are a cause for concern over the possibility of renewed increases in home prices. This month, leading central banks announced quantitative easing programs which are expected to support the global economy in coming months. The Fed announced that the federal funds rate is expected to remain at its low level through the middle of 2015. Stock and bond markets reacted with optimism. With that, the level of economic risk from around the world remains high, and with it the concerns over negative effects on the local economy. Real economic data around the world continue to indicate weakness. Assessments are that the debt crisis will continue to be a major risk. Currency (Unit) Rate Daily Change. Nominal Effective Rate -0.124%. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for August increased by 1 percent, above the range of forecasts, which averaged 0.6 percent, and above the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target. The main components which stood out this month were housing (which increased by 1.1 percent), transport (which increased by 1.8 percent against thebackground of increased fuel prices), and fruit and vegetables (which increased by 7.9 percent). In August, the food component in the CPI increased by 0.9 percent, but over the previous 12 months the component actually declined by 0.6 percent. The CPI excluding housing increased by 1.4 percent overthe past 12 months. The rate of inflation over the previous twelve months was 1.9 percent, compared with 1.4 percent the previous month. On a seasonally adjusted basis, inflation since the beginning of the year has been 2.2 percent in annual terms. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Forecasts of the inflation rate over the next twelve months based on the average of forecasters' inflation predictions, on expectations calculated from the capital markets (break-even inflation), and on inflation expectations based on over-the-counter CPI futures contracts offered by banks, were stable this month, after increasing last month, and currently range from 2.2 percent to 2.5 percent. According to forecasters, prices are expected to increase by 0.8 percent over the next three months. In the coming months, the CPI will likely be affected by increases in indirect taxes and by high commodity prices worldwide which are expected to have an effect on local prices as well. Inflation expectations for two years and longer increased slightly and are currently around 2.5 percent. Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now derived from the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market are for 2.3 percent, and expectations based on the average projection of forecasters are for an interest rate of 2.1 percent. All forecasters who provide projections to the Bank of Israel predict that the interest rate for October will be unchanged. Real economic activity: Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month support the assessment that the economy is growing at a rate similar to that of recent quarters. Foreign trade data forAugust indicate a decline in goods exports, after a sharp increase in the previous quarter, and moderation in imports since the beginning of the year, against the background of moderation in global demand which is reflected in a trend of decline in global trade indices. The Composite State of the Economy Index for August increased by 0.1 percent, reflecting continued expansion at a moderate pace. Tax receipts deteriorated in August compared withprevious months as a result of a decline in direct taxes while in contrast, there was an increase in local VAT collection. The Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey for August indicates that the decline in the growth rate encompassed all industries except for the hotels industry, which stabilized. The survey also indicates that a decline in activity is expected in most of the business sector in the coming three months, led by lowexpectations of export orders. In addition, consumer confidence surveys (Globes. Bank Hapoalim, and the Central Bureau of Statistics) reflect pessimism. The Purchasing Managers Index for August, compiled by Bank Hapoalim, indicates a sharp decline from 41.9 points to 35.2 points, reflecting a decline in all its components (excluding raw materials prices), and particularlydemand for exports. The labor market: Labor market data which became available thismonth indicate continued employment growth, though at a more moderate rate. Most of the increase was in the public sector. Employment data overall indicate a high level of activity. Claims for unemployment benefits, including data through August, increased by 3 percent in the previous three months. The number of available posts in August is 4.5 percent lower than in the corresponding month of the previous year. In contrast, net filling of job vacancies increased in the second quarter, though its level remains lower than that of the previous two years. Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of total wage payments, were 6.9 percent higher in July-August in nominal terms than in the corresponding period of the previous year,compared with an increase of 6.5 percent in May-June. The Employers Survey and the Business Tendency Survey indicate expectations of continued growth in employment, though at a more moderate pace than in the past. Nominal wages increased by 1.8 percent in April-June, seasonally adjusted, compared with the preceding three months, and real wages increased by 1.1 percent. The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: The Bankof Israel Research Department's macroeconomic forecast for 2012 and 2013 was updated this month. (A separate press release presenting the forecast is issued together with this notice.) Projected GDP growth in 2012 was revised to 3.3 percent (compared with growth of 3.1 percent which was forecast in June) primarily as a result of domestic data for the first half of the year which became available. The forecast for 2013 was revised to 3 percent, from 3.4 percent in the previous forecast, primarily as a result of the deterioration in Europe's economy. According to the forecast, the Bank of Israel interest rate is expected to remain unchanged until the end of 2013, and the inflation rate over the next year is expected to accelerate slightly due to the increase in indirect taxes, the increase in commodityprices, and the depreciation of the currency which have already occurred. The inflation rate over the 4 quarters ending in the third quarter of 2013 is expected to be 2.6 percent. Budget data: Government activity data from January through August indicate that tax receipts are significantly lower than the receipts derived from the seasonal path, and based on developments to date, the deficitthis year is projected to be 3.5-4 percent of GDP. The VAT rate increase by 1 percentage point beginning in September is expected to increasegovernment revenues by NIS 1.2 billion in 2012. Government decisions on increasing indirect and direct taxes (beginning in 2013) are expected to increase revenues by about NIS 9 billion in 2013, and to contribute to reducingthe deficit by 0.8 percentage points. In addition, actions to intensify collection, and a method for collecting trapped profits, were decided on. With that, there is still uncertainty regarding the extent of collection from these two steps. If the budget for 2013 is not approved, the government will operate, until a new budget is passed, on monthly expenditures of one-twelfth of the 2012 expenditure budget, which signifies a real reduction in expenditure compared with the planned increase for 2013. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on August 26, 2012, through September 21, 2012, the shekel appreciated against the dollar by 3.43 percent, in line with the global trend, and against the background of various easing plans by central banks. The shekel depreciated by 0.5 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel appreciated by about 1.5 percent. The capital and money markets: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on August 26, 2012, through September 21, 2012, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 2.34 percent, a more moderate increase thanthe worldwide trend. The increases came against the background of increased monetary easing in major markets worldwide. Yields increased on government bonds, in line with the global trend, with an increase of 20-40 basis points on unindexed bonds and up to a 20 basis point increase in yields on CPI-indexed bonds, due to an increase in inflation expectations. The yield gap between 10-year Israeli government bonds and equivalent 10-year USTreasury securities increased by about 10 basis points, to about 280 basispoints. Makam yields also increased, by about 20 basis points alongmost of the curve, with one year yields increasing to 2.24 percent during the period. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five year CDS spread declined by about 16 basis points this month to 146 basis points, in line with the global trend of CDS spread declines. The Tel-Bond 20 Indexand the Tel-Bond 40 Index increased by 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in August, the M 1monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increasedby 6.5 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 7.4 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The outstanding debt of thebusiness sector increased in July by 0.3 percent, to NIS 791 billion, and since the beginning of the year the debt has increased by 1.3 percent. Total outstanding credit to households increased in July by 0.8 percent, to NIS 378 billion, within which the balance of outstanding housing credit was NIS 269 billion. The total volume of new mortgages granted in August was NIS 5.8 billion, compared with NIS 4.9 billion in July. It is likely that the volume of mortgages taken out in July-August was affected by purchases brought forward ahead of the expected VAT increase. Total new mortgages granted in the twelve months ending in August increased by 4.6 percent compared with the twelve months ending in July. Mortgage interest rates continued to decline this month on all indexation tracks, excluding the unindexed floating rate segment, which increased by about 0.1 percentage points aftera year of continuous declines. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (representing rents) increased by 1.1 percent in August. In the twelve months ending in August it increased by 3.8 percent, compared with an increase of 4 percent in the twelve months to July. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased in June-July by 0.8 percent, after recording no change in May-June. In the twelve months ending in July, home prices increased by 1 percent, compared with an increase of 1.2 percent in the twelve months to June. Activity in the construction industry is strong compared with its levels in the past decade. Building starts remain high and are expected to continue to be reflected in an increased inventory of homes. At the same time, the level of building starts remains below the record level of mid-2011, and there is a decline in the rate of properties marketed by the Israel Land Administration. There were 41,735 building starts in the twelve months to June, compared with 42,764 in the twelve months to May. In July, thestock of vacant homes available for sale was 20,390 (including those builtby private initiative and public housing). The figure has been stable overthe past year. In July, about 10,300 homes were purchased, an increase of 29 percent compared with July 2011. A preliminary assessment for August by the State Revenue Administration indicates a moderate decline compared withJuly, but nevertheless an increase from August 2011. The share of homes bought for investment out of total homes sold in July remained similar to itslevel of previous months, about 23 percent. With that, it is likely that the transactions for July and August were influenced by, among other things,expectations for an increase in VAT. The global economy: This month, central banks announced quantitative easing measures. The ECB announced a plan to purchase sovereign bondsin order to stabilize the bond markets in heavily indebted eurozone countries. The Federal Reserve began to implement an additional plan to purchase mortgage backed securities. Additional easing steps were also taken by Japan. China, and South Korea. These plans are expected to support growth in the global economy in coming quarters. With that, assessments are that in thelonger term the debt crisis will continue to present a major risk. In response to these plans, equity markets worldwide responded with marked increases, while at the same time, there were sharp declines in yields on government bonds of countries in Europe suffering from the debt crisis. Data on theglobal real economy continue to indicate weakness. Investment houses assess that the US growth rate will remain low in coming quarters as well, and their average forecasts for the growth rates in several leading economies, primarily China and Japan, were revised lower. In Europe, the recession is deepening, which is reflected in weak data on real activity. In emerging market economies, signs of slowing persist; in China, it appears that the economic slowdown reflects real weakness. This month there was a mixed trend incommodity prices: metals increased sharply by 10 percent, while theprice of a barrel of Brent crude oil declined by about 2 percent. The inflation environment in major economies worldwide remained stable in a 1-3 percent range. The Fed announced that the interest rate is expected toremain unchanged until 2015. Central banks in Brazil. Sweden, and Hungary reduced interest rates this month, while the interest rate in Russia increased by 0.25 percent due to an acceleration in the rate of inflation. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to leave the interest rate for October 2012 unchanged at 2.25 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policy which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel, the global economy, monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: Following the publication of the August CPI, which surprised to the upside, the rate of inflation measured over the previous 12 months increased to 1.9 percent, from 1.4 percent. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the increasing uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior tothe above interest rate decision will be published on October 9, 2012. The decision regarding the interest rate for November 2012 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. October 29, 2012."
Georgia,2012-09-26,"26.09.12 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate unchanged at 5.75% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on September 26, 2012 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 5.75 percent. The core and headline inflation values in August were low, with the annual inflation reaching -0.4%. According to the existing forecasts in the coming months the inflation will start moderate growth and will approach its target value in the second half of the next year. The GDP growth in the second quarter was 8.2%, which is quite high. The economic activity indicators point that the output gap during the year will be close to zero. For the past two months there has been a certain deceleration in credit growth rates, caused by the decrease in the demand, which is characteristic for the pre-election period. Given the high liquidity in the banking sector, the credit activity from the banks is expected to increase in the coming months. Given that the inflation is predicted to achieve the target in the medium term and that the output gap is insignificant the National Bank of Georgia decided to keep the Monetary Policy Rate unchanged. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on October 24, 2012."
Czech Republic,2012-09-27,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 6th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 27 September 2012 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided to lower the two-week repo rate by 0.25 percentage point to 0.25%. At the same time it decided to cut the Lombard rate by 0.75 percentage point to 0.75% and reduce the discount rate by 0.15 percentage point to 0.10%. Five members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for leaving interest rates unchanged. Reasons for the decision At the monetary policy horizon, headline inflation will be slightly above the CNB's inflation target due to tax changes, monetary-policy relevant inflation will be in the lower half of the tolerance band. Consistent with the forecast is a decline in market interest rates in the next few quarters, followed by a rise in rates in 2014. Developments in industrial production, construction output and retail sales in July indicate persistent weakness in economic activity. The labour market stagnation continues: Total employment saw only slight y-o-y growth in 2012 Q2, the s.a. general unemployment rate increased moderately compared to the previous quarter, and the s.a. registered unemployment rate has risen negligibly in 2012 Q3 so far. Y-o-y growth in the average nominal wage decelerated markedly in 2012 Q2. The inflationary effects of external cost-push factors strengthened somewhat due to higher oil prices.

Romania,2012-09-27,"In its meeting of September 27, 2012, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR will closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by accordingly adjusting its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving price stability in the medium term, as well as maintaining financial stability. The annual inflation rate picked up, reaching 3.88 percent in August 2012, as a result of a statistical base effect, which was anticipated in the NBR forecasts. This will have a temporary unfavourable influence, yet it is already amplified by the drought-induced increase in domestic volatile food prices and the rise in prices of global agri-food commodities, as well as by the recent developments in exchange rates on forex markets. However, up to August 2012, the average 12-month growth rate of consumer prices was 2.8 percent, close to the EU and euro area average levels. At the same time, annual adjusted CORE2 inflation1 stood at 2.6 percent compared with 2.3 percent in July, given that the unfavourable impact of a weaker domestic currency, with an effect on inflation expectations, was mitigated by the persistence of a negative output gap. The external environment remained volatile, marred by uncertainties surrounding a lasting solution to the euro area sovereign debt crisis and the developments in the banking systems of some European countries, against the background of worsening growth prospects worldwide. In this context, the high volatility of investors' risk aversion remains the key coordinate of the external environment, weighing on capital flows. The monetary analysis underlines a further reduction in the dynamics of credit to the private sector, with a more pronounced slowdown in its foreign currency component. Monetary policy preserved its prudent stance, by adjusting broad monetary conditions to the domestic and global macroeconomic environment. The central bank's efforts to manage liquidity on the money market led to a slight alleviation in the asymmetry of liquidity distribution. Recent assessments show a worsening short-term outlook for inflation, particularly in respect to volatile prices, as some risks highlighted in the latest NBR forecast have materialised, especially those regarding developments in global and domestic food prices. The persistence of a wide negative output gap will, however, further exert disinflationary effects. This context calls for preserving a prudent monetary policy stance in order to ensure a firm anchoring of inflation expectations. The further prudent monetary policy stance is also required by the uncertainty-ridden external environment which, together with domestic developments in the run-up to the elections, could entail an abrupt heightening of the risks associated with the volatility of capital flows and of the exchange rate. Therefore, the NBR Board has decided to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged at 5.25 percent per annum, to ensure the adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR is restating that the implementation of a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and of structural reforms, amid the fulfilment of commitments under the external financial arrangements with the European Union, the IMF and other international financial institutions, is essential to achieving price stability in the medium term as well as consolidating financial stability, both being prerequisites for lasting and sustainable economic growth. The NBR Board reaffirms that it will closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by accordingly adjusting its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of the central bank's objectives in terms of financial and price stability. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 2 November 2012, when the new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1 Calculated by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index.

Armenia,2012-10-01,"Press Release 10.01.2012 Interest rate unchanged, 8 percent In the January 10, 2012 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. In December of 2011 inflation was 2.5 percent, and the 12-month inflation for 2011 amounted to 4.7 percent as a result, which is within the confidence band of 4%±1.5 pp. The Board admitted that inflationary pressures coming in to the Armenian economy from external environment in short run are weak: international prices of raw materials and food products fell in December in view of the slowing of the world economy. Nevertheless, world economic developments and possible inflationary pressures therefrom are in the focus of the Central Bank. Inflationary pressures from domestic economic developments are at their smallest as the impact of the fiscal policy and private spending as well as the developments in the labor market on the inflation environment are estimated to be neutral. The Board summarized that progress of the Armenian economy is congruent with the trends outlined in monetary policy programs, and that the confidence band of 4%±1.5 pp envisaged for the 12-month time horizon will be attainable.

Poland,2012-10-03,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 3 October 2012 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 2-3 October 2012 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 4.75% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 6.25% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 3.25% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate at 5.00% on an annual basis. Available data indicate that global economic activity in 2012 Q3 remained low. Recession in the euro area was accompanied by merely moderate growth in the United States. At the same time, many emerging economies saw further slowdown in economic growth. Taking into account unfavourable outlook for economic growth, central banks of major developed economies further eased their monetary policy in September, primarily, by announcing the expansion or launch of new quantitative easing programs. Stronger monetary expansion pursued by major central banks has brought some improvement in the sentiment in the international financial markets, supporting prices of some financial assets. At the same time, due to the worsening outlook for global economic growth, the rise in commodity prices in the world markets was halted. Although low global economic activity supports inflation decline, still relatively high commodity prices contribute to inflation remaining elevated in many countries. The data on economic activity in Poland in July and August, including ongoing deceleration of industrial production, persisting decline in construction output and further decrease in retail sales growth, point to a continued downturn in economic conditions in 2012 Q3. Also data on labour market developments, including fall in employment and low wage growth in the corporate sector and gradually rising unemployment rate, signal a possible slowdown in demand from the private sector. This is also indicated by the worsening of most economic sentiment indicators. Economic slowdown is accompanied by a gradual deceleration in lending to households, including further decline of consumer loans, and continued moderate rise in lending to corporates. In August. CPI inflation fell again to 3.8%, however, it remained above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. At the same time, there was a decline in inflation net of food and energy prices and a slight drop in inflation expectations of households and of corporate sector. 00-919 Warszawa, ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, tel. (22) 653 28 88, fax (22) 653 13 28 In the opinion of the Council, inflation will decrease gradually over the coming months, as the statistical base effect wanes amidst slowing demand in the economy. However, it will remain above the inflation target of 2.5% until the end of 2012. In the medium term, the slowdown in economic growth will contribute to inflation returning to the target while high commodity prices in the global markets remain an upward risk to inflation decline. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. Should the incoming data, including the November inflation projection of the NBP, confirm that economic slowdown would become protracted, while the risk of increase in inflationary pressure be limited, the Council will ease monetary policy."
Armenia,2012-10-04,"Press Release 10.04.2012 Interest rate unchanged, 8 percent In the April 10th of 2012 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. There was 0.1 percent inflation recorded in March of 2012, and the 12-month inflation decreased against the previous month's indicator by 0.8 pp and reached 2.2 percent, which is somewhat below the confidence band. The Board admitted that the external sector developments on the inflation environment in Armenia are mainly in line with the baseline scenario of the monetary policy program: in some advanced countries international prices of food products create a minor inflationary environment amid positive trends of economic activity. However, the risk of prices of oil products in international market continues to materialize, as outlined in the monetary policy program, conditioned by geopolitical developments in the Middle East. The Board accepted that the impact of domestic economic developments on the inflation environment is congruent with the baseline scenario of the program and is non- inflationary, on the whole. The Board evaluates that in the current perspective of world and domestic economic development there is much probability that the 12-month inflation will be within the confidence band of 4%±1.5 pp in the forecast horizon. With this situation, the CBA will continue maintaining the policy rate at the 8 percent level, which will leave a neutral impact on the inflation environment. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in the Minutes on Interest Rate due on April 20, 2012. The Central Bank Public Relations."
Euroarea,2012-10-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I would like to thank Governor Kranjec for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Owing to high energy prices and increases in indirect taxes in some euro area countries, inflation rates are expected to remain above 2% throughout 2012, but then to fall below that level again in the course of next year and to remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Consistent with this picture, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Economic growth in the euro area is expected to remain weak, with ongoing tensions in some euro area financial markets and high uncertainty still weighing on confidence and sentiment. Our decisions as regards Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) have helped to alleviate such tensions over the past few weeks, thereby reducing concerns about the materialisation of destructive scenarios. It is now essential that governments continue to implement the necessary steps to reduce both fiscal and structural imbalances and proceed with financial sector restructuring measures. The Governing Council remains firmly committed to preserving the singleness of its monetary policy and to ensuring the proper transmission of the policy stance to the real economy throughout the euro area. OMTs will enable us to provide, under appropriate conditions, a fully effective backstop to avoid destructive scenarios with potentially severe challenges for price stability in the euro area. Let me repeat again what I have said in past months: we act strictly within our mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term; we act independently in determining monetary policy; and the euro is irreversible. We are ready to undertake OMTs, once all the prerequisites are in place. As we said last month, the Governing Council will consider entering into OMTs to the extent that they are warranted from a monetary policy perspective as long as programme conditionality is fully respected. We would exit from OMTs once their objectives have been achieved or when there is a failure to comply with a programme. OMTs would not take place while a given programme is under review and would resume after the review period once programme compliance has been assured. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP contracted by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2012, following flat growth in the previous quarter. Economic indicators, in particular survey results, confirm the continuation of weak economic activity in the third quarter of 2012, in an environment characterised by high uncertainty. We expect the euro area economy to remain weak in the near term and to recover only very gradually thereafter. The growth momentum is supported by our standard and non-standard monetary policy measures, but is expected to remain dampened by the necessary process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors, the existence of high unemployment and an uneven global recovery. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. They relate, in particular, to ongoing tensions in several euro area financial markets and the potential spillover to the euro area real economy. These risks should be contained by effective action by all policy-makers in the euro area. Euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.7% in September 2012, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, compared with 2.6% in the previous month. This is higher than expected and mainly reflects past increases in indirect taxes and euro-denominated energy prices. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates could remain at elevated levels, before declining to below 2% again in the course of next year. Over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain moderate. Current levels of inflation should thus remain transitory and not give rise to second-round effects. We will continue to monitor closely further developments in costs, wages and prices. Risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be broadly balanced over the medium term. Upside risks pertain to further increases in indirect taxes owing to the need for fiscal consolidation. The main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area, in the event of a renewed intensification of financial market tensions, and its effects on the domestic components of inflation. If not contained by effective action by all policy-makers in the euro area, such intensification has the potential to affect the balance of risks on the downside. Turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm the subdued underlying pace of monetary expansion. In August the annual growth rate of M3 decreased to 2.9%, from 3.6% in July. While this decline was mainly due to a base effect, monthly inflows were also relatively contained. Conversely, strong monthly inflows into overnight deposits contributed to a further increase in the annual rate of growth of M1 to 5.1% in August, compared with 4.5% in July. This increase reflects a continuing high preference for liquidity in an environment of low interest rates and high uncertainty. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) declined in August to -0.2% (from 0.1% in July), reflecting a decrease in the annual rate of growth of loans to non-financial corporations to -0.5%, from -0.2% in July. By contrast, the annual growth of loans to households remained unchanged, at 1.0%, in August. To a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the weak outlook for GDP, heightened risk aversion and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises, all of which weigh on credit demand. At the same time, in a number of euro area countries, the segmentation of financial markets and capital constraints for banks restrict credit supply. The soundness of banks' balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels, thereby contributing to an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions of the non-financial sectors in the different countries of the euro area. It is thus essential that the resilience of banks continues to be strengthened where needed. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. Other economic policy areas need to make substantial contributions to ensure a further stabilisation of financial markets and an improvement in the outlook for growth. As regards fiscal policies, euro area countries are progressing with consolidation. It is crucial that efforts are maintained to restore sound fiscal positions, in line with the commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact and the 2012 European Semester recommendations. A rapid implementation of the fiscal compact will also play a major role in strengthening confidence in the soundness of public finances. At the same time, structural reforms are as essential as fiscal consolidation efforts and measures to improve the functioning of the financial sector. In the countries most strongly affected by the crisis, noticeable progress is being made in the correction of unit labour cost and current account developments. Decisive product and labour market reforms will further improve the competitiveness of these countries and their capacity to adjust. Finally, it is essential to push ahead with European institution-building. The ECB welcomes the Commission proposal of 12 September 2012 for a single supervisory mechanism (SSM) involving the ECB, to be established through a Council regulation on the basis of Article 127 of the Treaty. The Governing Council considers an SSM to be one of the fundamental pillars of a financial union and one of the main building blocks towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union. We will formally issue a legal opinion in which we will, in particular, take into account the following principles: a clear and robust separation between supervisory decision-making and monetary policy; appropriate accountability channels; a decentralisation of tasks within the SSM; an effective supervisory framework ensuring coherent oversight of the euro area banking system; and full compatibility with the Single Market framework, including the role and prerogatives of the European Banking Authority. As the Commission proposal sets out an ambitious transition schedule towards the SSM, the ECB has started preparatory work so as to be able to implement the provisions of the Council regulation as soon as it enters into force."
Pakistan,2012-10-05,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 5th October 2012 declining inflation together with weak growth in credit to private businesses is the basic context in which SBP reduced its policy rate by 150 bps in August 2012. These indicators point towards muted aggregate demand. In particular, continuous decline in investment as percentage of GDP is source of concern as it is hampering prospects of sustainable medium term economic growth. The resumption of monetary easing, in this environment, was deemed necessary to influence the behavior of borrowers in the private sector and scheduled banks to step up efforts to improve their intermediary role. host of factors need to be considered for this to be sufficiently effective. Prominent among these are considerable improvement in the availability of energy and reduction in fiscal borrowing needs from the banking system. The former is expected to facilitate an increase in the demand for credit and the latter would help in improving the supply of credit to the private sector. Further support to SBP's initiative can come from realization of expected foreign financial inflows that would alleviate the balance of payment concerns and help in easing the considerable fiscal pressure on domestic borrowings. consistent deceleration in inflation since May 2012, to. percent in September 2012, is more than earlier estimates. Thus despite an expected uptick in H2-FY13 the overall inflation outlook has improved. In fact, the likelihood of meeting the. percent inflation target for FY13 has increased. At the macro level, it seems that the effect on inflation of falling private investment demand is becoming more pronounced than the influence of high fiscal borrowings. The disaggregate CPI inflation data also show that this could be beginning of broad based trend. The number of commodities with double digit year-on-year inflation has slightly come down in the last few months after secular increase over the last three years; first in the food group and now in the non food group as well. The decline in 20 percent trimmed core inflation measure, to 10. percent in September 2012, is slower than the fall in CPI inflation. This indicates persistence of inflation expectations due to inertial effect of high inflation experienced in the recent past, overall rising trend in fiscal borrowings from the SBP, and depreciation of exchange rate. The recent fall in inflation together with retirement of Rs412 billion of fiscal borrowings from SBP during Q1-FY13 could bring down core inflation further by having beneficial impact on inflation expectations. This would depend, however, on the fiscal authority's resolve to maintain this trend in the coming quarters. The retirement to SBP was made possible by substantial borrowings from the scheduled banks; Rs437 billion during July 21 September. FY13. Consequently the outstanding amount of liquidity injections by the SBP has increased to Rs611. billion by the end of Q1-FY13. While this may not be an optimal situation, it is necessary in current circumstances. This is because some base money creation is essential to avoid an economic depression. The creation of money through the other source, accumulation in the Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the banking system, is difficult due to weak foreign financial inflows. Similarly the SBP (Amendment) Act (2012) requires at least zero net flow of fiscal borrowings from SBP during year. Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN To continue to keep borrowings from SBP under check and avoid the negative consequences of excessive borrowings from the scheduled banks, comprehensive fiscal reforms should not be delayed further. These include, but are not limited to, broadening of the tax base, reduction in wasteful subsidies, and better coordination between federal and provincial governments in terms of keeping the consolidated fiscal position under control. reduction in the size of the fiscal deficit and thus need for substantial borrowings would also influence the behavior of scheduled banks. At the moment, scheduled banks are finding it easy to avoid the private sector by lending to the government without any risk. The year-on-year growth in loans to private sector businesses has declined from 2. percent in FY08 to. percent by the end of FY12. declining interest rate environment should lead towards rethink of this strategy. The scheduled banks will have to step up efforts to go back to their basic intermediary role and channel loanable funds to the private sector. The other critical, and probably more fundamental, factor holding back off-take in the private sector credit is the consistent shortage of energy. By reducing the effective utilization of installed productive capacity, it has adversely affected the demand for fresh credit. Despite substantial subsidies given to the energy sector, the re-emergence of the inter-agency circular debt shows that increasing the electricity tariffs alone is not sufficient. An effective overhaul of the governance structure of the energy sector is important for the revival of private credit, investment, and sustainable medium to long term economic growth. durable solution to the energy sector can have positive feedback effects on the fiscal position by lowering the subsidy burden. This in turn, would help in reducing the borrowing requirements and extent of crowding out of the private sector. Resumption of foreign financial inflows, especially the realization of budgeted inflows, can also have similar impact. Thus at broader level, the effectiveness of SBP's current monetary policy stance continues to weigh upon improvement in the fiscal position, better availability of energy, and an increase in foreign financial inflows. Weak foreign financial inflows are the main challenge faced by the balance of payment position. The external current account balance, on the other hand, is small and shrinking. In fact, during the first two months of FY13, it posted surplus of $884 million. This is primarily due to robust growth in remittances, $2. billion received in July and August 2012, and receipt of $1.12 billion Coalition Support Funds in August 2012. Constrained by energy shortages and weak global economy, the export growth remains subdued. The import growth has also slowed down and most of the incremental increase over the corresponding period of last year is because of price impact. In conclusion, after giving due consideration to these factors. SBP's Central Board of Directors has decided to reduce the policy rate by 50 basis points to 10 percent with effect from 8th October 2012. To strengthen the liquidity management framework. SBP has also decided to implement certain measures, details of which are being issued separately. Page of."
Russia,2012-10-05,"The Bank of RussiaExternal and Public Relations Department informs that on 5 October 2012 theBoard of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain the refinancingrate and the interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations unchanged (table “Interest rates onthe Bank of Russia operations”). The decision wassupported by the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects. In Septemberthe pace of inflation continued to rise and reached 6.6% over a year ago, whichexceeds the inflation target range. Price growth acceleration observed inrecent months is mainly attributed to the food price dynamics and the increasein the regulated prices and tariffs. However, the continued increase in thecore inflation rate implies that inflation is spreading to other consumermarket segments, while, according to the Bank of Russia estimates, significantdemand-pull price pressures are absent. The dynamicsof the key macroeconomic indicators in August pointed to a certain slowdown ineconomic activity, reflected in slower industrial production growth as well aslower investment and consumer demand growth rates. However, employment andeconomic confidence indicators on the whole didn't exhibit deterioration inAugust-September. Labour market conditions together withcredit expansion support robust domestic demand. According to the Bank ofRussia estimates, gross output remains close to its potential level. There are certainsigns of the stabilization of the banking credit growth. However, the Bank of Russiajudges that currently the risks of a significant economic slowdown stemmingfrom somewhat tighter monetary conditions are minor. The Bank of Russia willcontinue to monitor inflation risks, including global food price dynamics, globaleconomic developments and the consequences of the monetary conditions tighteningfor the Russian economy.

Armenia,2012-10-07,"Press Release 10.07.2012 Interest rate unchanged, 8 percent In the July 10th of 2012 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. There was 1.3 percent deflation recorded in June of 2012, and the 12-month inflation amounted to 0.7 percent, which is still below the confidence band. The Board admitted that actual trends in the external sector in the second quarter of 2012 were mainly consistent with the baseline scenario of the Q2 monetary policy program, namely an anticipation of non-inflationary pressures in the forecast horizon. With escalation of debt problems in Eurozone and further expectation of slowing of world demand, the deflationary environment will persist in world commodity markets, although international wheat market saw some rise in prices due to reduction in world wheat harvest. The influence of developments in the Armenian economy on domestic prices in the forecast horizon is expected to be somewhat inflationary as higher economic growth attributable to faster growth rates in output volumes in industry and services will reflect the stimulation of aggregate demand and faster growing private consumption. The impact of fiscal policy on prices in the forecast horizon is estimated to be neutral. In consideration of the influence of the external economies and Armenian economy, and that the dram further tended to depreciate in June, which is an easing of monetary conditions, the Board decided to withhold from changing the Refinancing Rate. This is also supported by an argument that the low level of the 12-month inflation in the last couple of months was determined mainly by prominent seasonality of prices of agricultural products, under which circumstance the 12-month core inflation remains within the confidence band. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in the Minutes on Interest Rate due on July 20, 2012. The Central Bank Public Relations."
South Korea,2012-10-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 3.00% to 2.75%. In a related action, the Committee also lowered the interest rate on Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans by 25 basis points from 1.50% to 1.25% (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 3.00% to 2.75%. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the economic recovery in the US to have continued, albeit at a moderate pace, but the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have deepened. Growth has continued to slow in emerging market countries as well, due mostly to the impact of the economic slumps in advanced countries. The Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be very modest going forward and judges the downside risks to growth to be large, owing chiefly to the spillover of the euro area fiscal crisis to the real economy and to the possibility of the so-called fiscal cliff materializing in the US. In Korea, the Committee appraises economic growth to have been weak, as exports and domestic demand have both been lackluster. On the employment front, amid its continued uptrend led by the higher age groups and the service industry, the number of persons employed has increased by a greater margin in the manufacturing sector as well. Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will persist for a considerable time, due mostly to the prolongation of the euro area fiscal crisis and to the enduring sluggishness of the global economy. Consumer price inflation and core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products continued to run at low levels at 2.0% and 1.4% respectively in September. The Committee forecasts that inflation will remain below the 3.0% midpoint of its target for the time being, owing primarily to the easing of demand- side pressures and despite the influence for example of international 1 grain price instability. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas declined at a somewhat faster pace, and those in the rest of the country generally stabilized at their levels of the previous month. In the financial markets, stock prices have risen and the Korean won has appreciated against the US dollar, due mostly to the improvement in international financial market conditions and to inflows of foreigners' securities investment funds in consequence of the additional quantitative easing policies of major advanced countries. Long-term market interest rates have declined slightly, primarily on concerns about the economic slowdown. Looking ahead, the Committee will closely monitor external risk factors and the consequent changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the inflation target over a medium-term horizon while continuing its efforts to lower inflation expectations and ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded."
Peru,2012-10-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2012 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based on the fact that inflation's deviation from the target has reflected mainly transitory supply factors in a domestic context characterized by an economic pace of growth close to the economy's potential rate of growth and in an external context characterized by high uncertainty in international financial markets, lower terms of trade, and prospects of lower growth in both developed and emerging countries. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider additional adjustments in monetary policy tools. Inflation in September showed a monthly rate of 0.54 percent, a higher rate than in August due mainly to increases in the prices of perishable food products, which were affected by adverse domestic weather conditions. As a result of this, inflation in the last 12 months rose from 3.53 percent in August to 3.74 percent in September. Core inflation recorded a rate of 0.19 percent in September and thus accumulated a rate of 3.47 percent in the last 12 months, a lower rate than in the previous month. Inflation excluding food and energy was almost nil (-0.04 percent) and showed an annual rate of 2.14 percent. In September, inflation continued to be affected by unfavorable local supply conditions observed in the case of some perishable food products, such as potato and some citrus fruits. Despite this, inflation is expected to gradually converge towards the target range in the next months. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show that the economy's growth has stabilized around its long-term sustainable level of growth, although the indicators associated with the external market register a weak performance. On the other hand, indicators of global economic activity show that uncertainty about the pace of global economic activity has increased. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Monetary Program for November will be approved on the Board's session of November 8, 2012."

The overall global economic outlook remained weak, although further monetary policy easing in major economies helped to support global financial market sentiment and latest indicators pointed towards some improvements in US housing and labour markets. Weak global demand had weighed more heavily on Chinese and regional economies than expected. Going forward, a more moderate growth outlook for the Chinese economy could dampen Asian exports further. At the same time, fiscal risks in the US and practical implementation challenges to the resolution of euro debt crisis posed significant risks to the global economic outlook. The Thai economy continued to expand in the third quarter, although the impact of softer global demand on exports and export production had become more apparent. The MPC assessed that the global economy would gradually improve next year, but the substantial degree of uncertainty surrounding the outlook could hamper exports in the period ahead. Domestic spending and private investment outlays continued to be robust, though investment moderated as flood-related expenditures tapered off. Credit growth to the private sector remained high and warranted close monitoring, while inflationary pressure stabilised at an acceptable level. With upside risk to inflation contained, the majority of MPC members deemed that monetary policy easing was warranted to shore up domestic demand in the period ahead and ward off the potential negative impact from the global economy, which remained weak and fragile. The MPC therefore voted 5 to 2 to reduce the policy rate by 025 percent, from 300 percent to 275 percent per annum, effective immediately. Two members voted to maintain the policy rate at 300 percent per annum deeming the current growth momentum to be adequate and that further policy action could await greater clarity in the economic outlook."
Chile,2012-10-18,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 18 October 2012 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). Internationally, global financial conditions have improved and the financial tensions in the Eurozone, while still high, have moderated in response to recent announcements by policy makers. However, there is still uncertainty about the implementation of these measures, and a resurgence of tensions in the coming months cannot be ruled out. Incoming information is in line with the outlook of slow growth in developed economies and a slowdown in the main emerging economies, as indicated in the last Monetary Policy Report. Accordingly, some central banks have taken additional measures of monetary stimulus. The United States has begun implementing the so-called QE3. The dollar has depreciated in international markets, while the prices of fuels and foodstuffs have declined. Domestically, output indicators have evolved around trend rates and private consumption has strengthened. The labor market remains tight, and both y-o-y CPI inflation and core inflation measures remain below 3%. Inflation expectations over the policy horizon remain around the target. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2012-10-18,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release October 18, 2012 In its meeting held on October 18, 2012, the Monetary Policy Commi(cid::425)ee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 925 percent and 1025 percent, respec(cid::415)vely, and the 7‐day repo at 975 percen. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 95 percen. While headline CPI increased by 120 percent (m/m) in September, the annual rate con(cid::415)nued on a downward trend reaching 622 percent from 647 percent recorded in the previous month, supported by base effects from last yea. The latest monthly developments in headline inflation were largely driven by higher prices of fresh vegetables which overshadowed favorable movements in other food price. On the other hand, core CPI declined by 031 percent (m/m) in September on the back of lower prices of selected food items along with broadly tame non‐food price. This month's decline in core CPI coincided with significantly favorable base effects from last year which led the annual rate to drop to 384 percent from 534 percent in Augus. It is important to underscore that if the latest pick up in international food prices proves to be persistent this would pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook along with the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channel. Meanwhile real GDP growth remained broadly stagnant, registering a growth rate of 22 percent in 2011/2012 following a similarly weak expansion of 18 percent in 2010/201. Continued weaknesses in the manufacturing and tourism sectors weighed heavily on GDP growth during 2011/2012 which suppressed the tenta(cid::415)ve signs of recovery in the construction secto. In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants since early 2011, investment levels remained lo. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Are. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. Given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks and the uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat Sub Governor.

Turkiye,2012-10-18,"b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been kept at 5 percent while lending rate has been cut from 10 percent to 9.5 percent. Interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been cut from 9.5 percent to 9 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been cut from 13 percent to 12.5 percent. Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand continues as envisaged. Domestic demand follows a moderate pace, while exports continue to increase despite the weakening global outlook. Overall, aggregate demand conditions support disinflation and current account deficit continues to decline gradually. The Committee expects the fall in inflation to become more evident during the last quarter of the year. However, a cautious stance regarding pricing behavior is warranted given that inflation will stay above the target rate for some time due to recent increases in administered and energy prices. Although the risk appetite has improved due to recent developments in financial markets, ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy necessitate the monetary policy to remain flexible on both sides. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. The Committee has stated that increasing the reserve option coefficients and narrowing the interest rate corridor by a measured amount would support financial stability. If deemed necessary, a measured step in the same direction may be taken in the forthcoming period. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Georgia,2012-10-24,"24.10.12 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate unchanged at 5.75% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on October 24, 2012 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged. The Monetary Policy Rate is equal to 5.75 percent. The core and headline inflation values in September were low, with the annual inflation reaching -0.1%. According to the existing forecasts in the coming months the inflation will start moderate growth and will approach its target value in the second half of the next year. The economic activity indicators point that the growth in the third quarter will be high, although the output gap is close to zero. According to the existing forecasts there are no expectations of economy overheating and demand-side pressures on prices. For the past year the real effective exchange rate has been stable. In September this parameter has slightly depreciated, which is an important factor for the improvement in the current account. At the same time the said dynamic in the real exchange rate also indicates that there are no risks of economy overheating. Given that the inflation is predicted to achieve the target in the medium term and that the output gap is insignificant the National Bank of Georgia decided to keep the Monetary Policy Rate unchanged. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on November 21, 2012."
Philippines,2012-10-24,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to reduce the BSP's key policy interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.50 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 5.50 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also reduced accordingly. This is the fourth time this year that the BSP has cut its policy rates and brings the cumulative reduction in BSP policy rates in 2012 to 100 basis points. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation environment continues to be benign. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that the future inflation path remains within target for 2012 up to 2014, with inflation expectations aligned to the inflation target within the policy horizon. Meanwhile, the risks to the inflation outlook continue to be broadly balanced. Potential upside risks to inflation remain, including pending power rate adjustments and higher global prices for some grains. Nonetheless, subdued global demand could moderate upward pressures on international commodity prices, thus tempering the overall outlook for inflation. At the same time, the Monetary Board notes that global economic prospects continue to face considerable headwinds. World economic conditions are likely to remain tepid as fiscal and financial sector stresses in advanced economies continue to dampen market confidence. The domestic underpinnings of Philippine economic growth remain firm. However, additional policy support could help ward off the risks associated with weaker external demand by encouraging investment and consumption. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board is of the view that monetary easing consistent with a manageable inflation outlook will help buffer domestic demand against ongoing global economic strains. Going forward, the BSP will closely monitor evolving price and output conditions to ensure that policy settings continue to effectively contain inflation while maintaining the growth momentum."
United States,2012-10-24,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months. Growth in employment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has advanced a bit more quickly, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed. The housing sector has shown some further signs of improvement, albeit from a depressed level. Inflation recently picked up somewhat, reflecting higher energy prices. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month. The Committee also will continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of Treasury securities, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. These actions, which together will increase the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee also decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Dennis P Lockhart; Sandra Pianalto; Jerome H Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Jeremy C Stein; Daniel K Tarullo; John C Williams; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M Lacker, who opposed additional asset purchases and disagreed with the description of the time period over which a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate and exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted."
Israel,2012-10-29,"Indicators which became available this month continue to strengthen the assessment that there has been some moderation in the growth rate to about 3 percent. These indicators are consistent with the Research Department's forecast which was published last month. Expectations seen in consumer surveys and the Business Tendency Survey are pessimistic and indicate predictions of further moderation in activity. Economic activity in the first few months of 2013 is expected to be affected by the fiscal restraint inherent in the monthly expenditure limitation until a new budget is approved. The inflation environment moderated in the past six months, with the continued slowing of the increase in the housing index (primarily representing rents). The rate of inflation over the previous twelve months was at the midpoint of the inflation target range. Most inflation expectations for the coming year are also at the midpoint of the target range, against the background of the decline in commodity prices and, in contrast, the expected increases in food prices. Against the background of the debt crisis in Europe, the level of economic risk from around the world remains high, and with it the concerns over negative effects on the local economy. Macro data published this month in the US and in Europe were mixed, and for the most part surprised to the upside, but this was relative to already low forecasts. This month the IMF reduced its global growth forecast for 2012 and 2013. Inflation worldwide continues to be low, and it continued to moderate in emerging market economies. Commodity prices, which declined this month, are also expected tosupport this trend. Central banks in major economies continue with quantitative easing programs, and several central banks reduced their interest rate this month. Home prices, as measured over the past 12 months, increased by 1.4 percent. However, home prices increased by 0.6 percent in the past month, and by 2.9 percent over the past 6 months. The increases in home prices in recent months and the continued growth in housing credit raise concerns of a continued increase in home prices. Against the background of the need to provide additional support for economic activity, and the absence of inflationary pressures, the Monetary Committee decided to reduce the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points. In light of the increases in home prices in recent months, and the continued increase in housing credit against the background of low interest rates in the mortgage market, the Supervisor of Banks at the Bank of Israel decided to issue a directive limiting the loan-to-value ratio, in order to support the stability of the banking system. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing high level of uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and inthis regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. Currency (Unit) Rate Daily Change. Nominal Effective Rate -0.124%. The Supervisor of Banks published a draft directive to limit the LTV in housing loans. To view the press release of the Supervisor of Banks - click here. Inflation data: TheConsumer Price Index (CPI) for September was unchanged. Forecasts projected an increase of 0.5 percent, on average. The main reason for the surprise compared with the forecasts was the decline in the pre-primary education component, which derived from the application of the law mandating free education to 3-4 year olds. This is a one-time factor resulting from policy. The effect was known in advance, but was not accounted for in most forecasts. The development of actual prices indicates the moderation of the inflation environment in the past six months, alongside the continued moderation in the increase in the housing index. The rate of inflation over the previous twelve months was 2.1 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Forecasts of the inflation rate over the next twelve months based on the average of forecasters' inflation predictions, and inflation expectations based on over-the-counter CPI futures contracts offered bybanks, declined after the publication of the CPI for September, from around 2.5 percent to around 2.1 percent. In contrast, expectations calculated from the capital markets (break-even inflation) remained high throughout themonth, at 2.5 percent, although it is likely that those expectations are biased upward this month. According to forecasters, prices are expected to increase by 0.3 percent over the next three months. This is against the background of, in the short term, expectations of imminent food price increases, and, in contrast, the recent declines in commodity prices worldwide. Inflation expectations for two years and longer remained stable at around 2.5 percent. Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from nowderived from the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market as well as expectations based on the average projection of forecasters, are for an interest rate of 2.1 percent. Most forecasters who provide projections to the Bank of Israel predict that the Bank will keep the interest rate for November unchanged. Real economic activity: Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month support the assessment of a moderate growth rate of about 3 percent. These indicators are in line with the Research Department forecast of 3.3 percentGDP growth in 2012. Data on revenue by industry in August indicate an increase in trade and services revenue, which was likely affected by the purchases brought forward ahead of the increase in the VAT rate. The Composite State of the Economy Index for September increased by 0.2 percent, reflectingan increase in nearly all the components of the index, excluding services exports. Following the Central Bureau of Statistics upward correction of goods exports data for August, the Composite Index data for August were also revised upward. Goods exports (in dollar terms, excluding ships, aircraft and diamonds) increased 5.7 percent in the third quarter, after a sharp decline in June. Goods imports (excluding ships, aircraft, diamonds, and fuel) registered a slight decline of 2 percent in the third quarter. Goods importand export data continued to maintain stability over time, similar to the trend since the beginning of 2011. Survey figures remained pessimistic withregard to future developments: the Purchasing Managers Index increased slightly this month, but remained at a level indicating sharp contraction in manufacturing activity, and expectations seen in the Bank Hapoalim and the Central Bureau of Statistics consumer confidence indices registered further deterioration, especially in the employment component. The labor market: Labor market data which became available this month indicate continued moderate growth in employment, though in recent months there has been some stabilization in business sector employment. Employment data for July and Augustindicate an increase of 1.5 percent (seasonally adjusted) in the number ofemployed persons, compared with the second quarter, with an increase in the rate of part time positions compared with full time positions. This growth occurred through a continued increase in the employment rate in those months, from 59.1 percent to 59.9 percent, together with a decline in the unemployment rate from 7 percent in the second quarter to 6.9 percent in August. Both the nominal wage and real wage increased by 1 percent in May-July compared with the preceding 3 months, based on seasonally adjusted figures. Health tax receipts indicate continued nominal growth of total wage payments in August and September, at a rate of more than 6 percent, compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: The Bank of Israel Research Department's macroeconomic forecast for 2012 and 2013 was updated last month. The forecast (which was published as a separate press release together with the previous interest rate notice) projected GDP growth of 3.3 percent in 2012 and 3 percent in 2013. According to the forecast, the Bank of Israel interest rate is expected to remain unchanged until the end of 2013, and the inflation rate over the four quarters ending with the third quarter of 2013 is expected to be 2.6 percent. With an upward revision in the number of building starts and building completions, the Research Department projects that the increase in the housing component of the CPI (representing rents) will moderate from an annual rate of 3.5 percent in 2012 to 0 percent in 2013, and by the middle of 2014 will reach negative 1.5 percent, which should contribute to the moderation in the increase of general price levels. Budget data: Tax receipts for the year to date through September are about NIS 4.5 billion lower than the figure derived from the revised seasonal path. In the past fourmonths there was an improvement in tax collection, and a reduction of the average deviation from the seasonal path. Assuming that government expenditure does not surpass the original amount in the budget, the deficit this year, based on developments to date, is projected to be about 4 percent of GDP. The framework of expenditures expected during the remainder of the year raises some concern of a higher deficit, but it is likely that technical delays due to the bringing forward of elections, will halt the spending. Likewise, bringing the elections forward is expected to have a restraining effect on fiscal developments in the beginning of 2013, primarily in the first quarter, due to the limitation of expenditure to one-twelfth of the previous year's budget until a new budget is passed. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on September 23, 2012, through October 26, 2012, the shekel appreciated against the dollarby 1.1 percent, in contrast with most major currencies, which weakened against the dollar. The shekel appreciated by 0.8 percent against the euro. Interms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel appreciated by about 1.2 percent. The capital and money markets: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on September 23, 2012, through October 26, 2012, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 5.3 percent, in contrast to the declines in stock markets worldwide, primarily in advanced economy countries. With that, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) closed the gap which had opened this year between its return and global stock market returns. Yields declined on government bonds: bothunindexed and CPI-indexed: by up to 30 basis points, in contrast togovernment bond markets in advanced economies, which traded with only minor changes. The yield gap between 10-year Israeli government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities decreased by about 30 basis points, toabout 250 basis points. Makam yields also declined along most of the curve, by up to 10 basis points, with one-year yields declining to 2.15 percent during the period. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread increased slightly this month to 150 basis points, in contrast to CDS spread declines in most countries. The Tel-Bond 20 Index and the Tel-Bond 40 Index increased by 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in August, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 11.8 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 7.4 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The outstanding debt of the business sector was stable in August at NIS 792.7 billion; since the beginning of the year the debt has increased by 1.6 percent. Total outstanding credit to households increased in August by 0.8 percent, to NIS 381 billion. The total volume of new mortgages granted in September was NIS 3.2 billion, compared with NIS 5.8 billionin August. Part of the decline in new mortgage volume can be attributed tothere having been fewer business days in the month due to the Jewish holidays, and to the fact that some transactions were brought forward ahead of the VAT increase which came into effect in September. The balance of housingdebt was NIS 272 billion at the end of August, an increase of 6.9 percent since August of 2011. Mortgage interest rates on new CPI-indexed mortgages granted in September remained essentially unchanged, while interest rates in the unindexed floating rate segment again increased by about 0.1 percentage points, following a similar increase in August. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (representing rents) declined by 0.1 percent in September. In the twelve months ending in September it increased by 2.8 percent, compared with an increase of 3.8 percent in the twelve months to August. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased in July-August by 0.6 percent, after increasing by 0.8 percent in June-July. In the twelve months ending in August, home prices increasedby 1.4 percent, compared with an increase of 1 percent in the twelve months to July. With that, during the past six months, home prices have risen by 2.9 percent. Activity in the construction industry is strong compared with its levels in the past decade. The number of building starts remains high and is expected to continue to be reflected in an increased stock of homes. At the same time, the level of building starts remains below the record level of mid-2011, and there is a decline in the rate of properties marketed by the Israel Land Administration. There were 40,554 building starts in the twelve months to July, compared with 42,462 in the twelve months to June. The global economy:The debt crisis in Europe continues to be the main risk to the global economy. Macro data released this month in the US and in Europe were mixed, butfor the most part included positive surprises (compared with already low forecasts). This month, the IMF lowered its global growth forecast for 2012 and 2013 to 3.3 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively, compared to 3.5% and 3.9% in the previous forecast. In its announcement, the IMF wrote that this forecast relies on optimistic assumptions: that the eurozone wouldsucceed in solving the problems of the countries in crisis within a reasonable amount of time, and that the United States would succeed in dealing with its budget problems (the fiscal cliff) and would outline a credible policy for returning to a path of sustainable debt. In addition, the IMF estimated that the banks in Europe would need markedly to lower their leverage,which is liable to harm credit and growth. This month, global financial markets continued the relatively optimistic behavior that has characterized them since the ECB and the Fed declared new programs of large scale asset purchases. The yields and CDS spreads of the countries at the heart of the crisis continued to decline. In contrast, central banks and governments around the world continued to lower growth and inflation forecasts. Inflation remains low worldwide, and it continued to moderate in emerging economies. Commodity prices, which declined this month: and based on market assessments are expected to continue to decline: will also support this trend. A number of central banks lowered their interest rates this month. Disappointing corporate results were reported recently in the US, particularly in the high tech sector, and the sentiment among companies and analysts has deteriorated significantly in the past month. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to reduce the interest rate for November 2012 by 0.25 percentage points to 2 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policy which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percenta year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel, the global economy, monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: <span style 3Dline-height:normal;font-variant:normal;font-style:normal;font-family:'times new roman';font-weight:normal> <span dir 3Dltr>Indicators which became available this month continue to strengthen the assessment that there has been some moderation in the growth rate to about 3 percent.

Hungary,2012-10-30,"At its meeting on 30 October 2012, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 25 basis points from 6.50% to 6.25%, with effect from 31 October 2012. In the Monetary Council's judgement, economic output is likely to fall this year, with growth only expected to resume in 2013. The level of output will be below its potential and unemployment will remain above its long-term level determined by structural factors in the period ahead. Weak demand conditions are expected to persist and the inflation target can be met in 2014 after the temporary inflationary impact of shocks to inflation wanes. Inflation picked up in September, mainly reflecting rises in food and fuel prices. The consumer price index remains high due mainly to increases in raw material prices as well as the effects of tax changes and administrative measures. Inflation is likely to stay significantly above the medium-term target this year and next; however, the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand is expected to increasingly dominate inflation developments as the upward pressure from one-off price level shocks fades. The Council expects the 3 per cent inflation target to be met in 2014. In order to reach a higher level of employment and mitigate cost pressures on companies, it is crucial that increases in wages next year, particularly in the minimum wage, are consistent with changes in whole-economy productivity. The Hungarian economy has fallen into recession and growth is likely to resume next year as the country's export markets recover. The latest economic data appear to confirm that domestic demand has remained subdued and external economic activity has weakened further. In the Monetary Council's judgement, output will remain persistently below its potential level and the labour market will remain loose. The weakness of corporate investment and persistently high unemployment suggest that the economy's potential growth rate is significantly below its pre-crisis level. The measures announced in recent weeks confirmed the Government's commitment to maintain a low fiscal deficit path. There is considerable uncertainty about the macroeconomic effects of the adjustment measures: the short-term outlook for growth and inflation is likely to be broadly unaffected, but cost pressures may arise in the medium term and the potential growth rate of the economy may fall, reflecting the reduced ability of the banking system to attract capital and restrained lending activity. The December issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation will contain the Monetary Council's detailed assessment of the effects of fiscal measures on inflation and the real economy. Perceptions of the risks associated with the economy have fallen significantly, with country-specific factors and regulatory changes both contributing to the positive developments in Hungary's risk indicators. Consistent with its earlier view, the Monetary Council considers it crucial that an agreement between the Government and the European Union and International Monetary Fund is reached, as this would contribute to a sustained improvement in risk perceptions and a decline in yields as well as to the sustainability of government debt and would help support lending activity and improve the investment climate. The Monetary Council judges that there remains a substantial margin of spare capacity in the economy. Therefore, the cost shocks hitting the economy have no adverse effect on the medium-term outlook for inflation, and the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand will dominate as the effects of cost shocks wane. The improving global financial market environment, coupled with the Government's strong commitment to maintain a low fiscal deficit, may contribute to a sustained decline in risk premia on domestic financial assets. Expected developments in inflation and financial markets as well as persistently weak demand warrant a lower interest rate level. The Council will consider a further reduction in interest rates if data becoming available in the coming months confirm that the improvement in financial market sentiment persists and the medium-term outlook for inflation remains consistent with the 3 per cent target."
India,2012-10-30,"Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2012-13 Press Statement by Dr.D. Subbarao. Governor. Reserve Bank of India ""First of all, on behalf of the Reserve Bank. I want to welcome you all to this Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2012-13. A short while ago, we put out the Second Quarter Review. Based on an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, we have decided to: Cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks by 25 basis points from 4.5 per cent to 4.25 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) effective the fortnight beginning November 3, 2012. The reduction in the CRR, will inject around 175 billion of primary liquidity into the banking system. There is no change in policy interest rate. Accordingly, the repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility remains at 8.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), determined with a spread of 100 basis points below the repo rate, will continue at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate, determined with a spread of 100 bps above the repo rate, at 9.0 per cent. Considerations Behind the Policy Move 5. Let me begin with an explanation of the rationale behind this monetary policy action. The decision to cut the CRR and keep the policy interest rate unchanged draws from our assessment of the evolving liquidity situation and the growth-inflation dynamic. First on liquidity. Systemic liquidity deficit has been high because of several factors: the wedge between deposit and credit growth, the build-up of Government's cash balances from mid-September and the drainage of liquidity on account of festival-related step-up in currency demand. This high systemic deficit will have adverse implications for the flow of credit to productive sectors and for the overall growth of the economy going forward.2 As regards the growth-inflation balance, headline WPI inflation moderated from its peak of 10.9 per cent in April 2010 to an average rate of 7.5 per cent over the period January-August 2012. During this time, growth has slowed and is currently below trend. This slowdown is due to a host of factors, including monetary tightening. Since April 2012, the Reserve Bank's monetary policy stance has sought to balance the growthinflation dynamic through calibrated easing. The transmission of these policy impulses through the economy is still underway. In conjunction with the fiscal and other measures recently announced by the Government, the Reserve Bank's monetary policy stance should work towards arresting the loss of growth momentum over the next few months. Yesterday's statement by the Finance Minister reaffirming commitment to fiscal consolidation will open up space for monetary policy to restrain inflation and support growth. Now coming to inflation. It turned up again in September, reflecting the partial pass-through of adjustment of diesel and electricity prices, and elevated inflation in non-food manufactured products. It is, therefore, critical that even as the monetary policy stance shifts further towards addressing growth risks, the objective of containing inflation and anchoring inflation expectations is not de- emphasised. Monetary Policy Stance 7. The policy document spells out the three broad contours of our monetary policy stance. These are: first, to manage liquidity to ensure adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors of the economy; second, to reinforce the positive impact of government policy actions on growth as inflation risks moderate; and third, to maintain an interest rate environment to contain inflation and anchor inflation expectations. Guidance 8. As in the past, we have also given guidance for the period forward. In reducing CRR, the Reserve Bank intended to pre-empt a prospective tightening of liquidity conditions, thereby keeping liquidity comfortable and supportive of growth. The policy stance anticipates the projected inflation trajectory which indicates a rise in inflation over the next few months before easing in the last quarter. While there are risks to this trajectory, the baseline scenario suggests a reasonable likelihood of further policy easing in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. Let me add though that this guidance will, however, be conditioned by the evolving growth-inflation dynamic. Expected Outcomes 10. We expect that today's policy actions, and the guidance that we have given, will result in the following three outcomes:3 first, liquidity conditions will facilitate a turnaround in credit growth to productive sectors so as to support growth; second, as inflation risks moderate, the growth stimulus of the policy actions announced by the Government will be reinforced; and, finally, the policy action will anchor medium-term inflation expectations on the basis of a credible commitment to low and stable inflation. Global and Domestic Developments 11. As always, our policy action has been based on a careful assessment of the global and domestic macroeconomic situation. Let me comment first on the global economy. Global Economy 12. Over the last quarter, policymakers around the world have confronted increasingly difficult challenges. Globally, even as the growth momentum has slowed, governments have had to manage the balance between fiscal consolidation and growth stimulus amidst visible signs that the two objectives are in conflict with each other. As the advanced economies deal with these tensions and global demand conditions weaken, emerging and developing economies are also slowing down. Liquidity infusions by central banks in advanced economies during the quarter have contributed to some stability in global financial markets. It is important to note though that liquidity infusions are only a stop-gap measure intended to maintain financial stability and arrest further downturn. They cannot substitute for robust structural solutions that can return the advanced economies to the path of recovery. At this stage, growth risks have risen and could well overwhelm the positive effects of enhanced liquidity. Moreover, notwithstanding some muted softening recently, commodity prices are still at elevated levels. Consequently, there is a significant risk of liquidity-driven price increases. Even as the global recovery process moves forward, the months ahead will be a period of heightened uncertainty for the global economy. Indian Economy 14. Let me now turn to the domestic macroeconomic situation. Growth decelerated over four successive quarters, from 9.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2010-11 to 5.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011-12. In the first quarter of this year, growth was marginally higher at 5.5 per cent. This slight improvement in GDP growth in the first quarter was mainly driven by growth in construction, and supported by better than expected growth in agriculture. On the demand side, the growth of gross fixed capital formation decelerated, while the slowdown in growth of private consumption expenditure continued. The external demand conditions and crude oil prices also remained unfavourable, adversely impacting net exports. Over the last quarter, global risks have increased and domestic risks have become accentuated owing to halted investment demand, moderation in consumption spending and continuing erosion in export competitiveness accompanied by weakening business and consumer confidence. The industrial outlook remains uncertain. Notwithstanding the improvement in rainfall in the months of August and September, the first advance estimates of the 2012 kharif production are about 10 per cent lower than last year's production.4 16. On the basis of the above considerations, the baseline projection of GDP growth for 2012-13 is revised downwards from 6.5 per cent to 5.8 per cent. Inflation 17. Moving on to inflation. Headline WPI inflation remained sticky, at above 7.5 per cent on a y-o-y basis, through the first half of the current year. Furthermore, in September there was a pick-up in the momentum of headline inflation owing to the increase in fuel prices and elevated price levels of non-food manufactured products. This is, in part, attributable to some suppressed inflation in the form of earlier under- pricing being corrected. However, even after adjusting for this, the momentum remains firm. While WPI primary food articles moderated since July due to the softening of prices of vegetables, prices of cereal and protein items edged up. WPI food products inflation increased in September, mainly due to the firming up of the prices of sugar, edible oils and grain mill products. Fuel group inflation registered a significant rise in September, reflecting the sharp increase in prices of electricity effected from June, the partial impact of the increase in prices of diesel in mid-September and significant increase in non- administered fuel prices on account of rising global crude prices. Non-food manufactured products inflation was persistent at 5.6 per cent through July-September. This upside pressure was a result of firm prices of metal products and other inputs and intermediates, especially goods with high import content due to a depreciating rupee. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the new CPI, remained elevated, reflecting the build-up of food price pressures. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel groups ebbed slightly during June-September, from double digits earlier. Looking ahead, the path of inflation will be shaped by two sets of counteracting forces. First, on the downside, slower growth and excess capacity in some sectors will help moderate core inflation. Stable, or in the best case scenario, declining commodity prices will reinforce this tendency. An appreciating rupee will also help to contain inflationary pressures by bringing down the rupee cost of imports, especially of commodities. Balancing those downside forces are some on the upside. Persistent supply constraints may aggravate as demand revives, resulting in price pressures. Global financial instability could put downward pressure on the rupee and that will add to imported inflation. Also, the upsurge in both rural and urban wages will exert cost-push pressures on inflation. Finally, as under-pricing in several products is corrected as part of the fiscal consolidation process, suppressed inflation is being brought into the open. This correction is necessary and important. Nevertheless, it will result in higher inflation readings.5 23. Taking the above factors into consideration, the baseline projection for headline WPI inflation for March 2013 is raised to 7.5 per cent from 7.0 per cent indicated in July. Importantly, inflation is expected to rise somewhat in the third quarter before beginning to ease in the fourth quarter. Monetary and Liquidity Conditions 24. Let me now move on to monetary and liquidity conditions. Money supply (M ), 3 deposit and credit growth have so far trailed below the indicative trajectories of the Reserve Bank indicated in the April Policy and reiterated in the July Review. Deposit growth has decelerated with the moderation in interest rates, especially term deposits. Credit growth has ebbed with the slowdown in investment demand, especially with regard to infrastructure, and lower absorption of credit by industry, in general. Keeping in view the developments during the year so far and the usual year-end pick-up, the trajectories of the monetary aggregates for 2012-13 are projected at 14 per cent for M , 15 per cent for deposit growth and 16 per cent for growth of non-food credit. Liquidity conditions, as reflected in the average net borrowing under the LAF at 486 billion during July-September, remained within the comfort zone of (+/-) one per cent of NDTL. However, liquidity conditions tightened in October, mainly on account of the build-up in the Government's cash balances and the seasonal increase in currency demand, taking the average LAF borrowing to 871 billion during October 15-25, well above the band of (+/-) one per cent of NDTL Risk Factors 26. Now, let me highlight the risks to our growth and inflation projections: First, the downside risks to growth stemming from the global macroeconomic environment now seem likely to be stronger than earlier thought. Domestically, a revival in investment activity, which is key to stimulating growth, depends particularly on the recent policy announcements by the Government being translated into effective actions; Second, despite recent moderation, global commodity prices remain high. Also, under recoveries in domestic prices of administered petroleum products persist and will need to be corrected. While corrections are welcome from the viewpoint of overall macroeconomic stability, we will have to guard against their second-round effects on inflation. Third, the behaviour of food inflation will depend on the supply response in respect of commodities characterised by structural imbalances, particularly protein items; Fourth, the persistent increase in rural and urban wages, unaccompanied by commensurate productivity increase, has been and will continue to be a source of inflationary pressures; Fifth, the large twin deficits, i.e., the current account deficit and the fiscal deficit pose significant risks to both growth and macroeconomic stability; and Finally, while liquidity pressures pose risks to credit availability for productive purposes and could adversely affect overall investment, excess liquidity could aggravate inflation risks.6 Developmental and Regulatory Policies 27. This review also includes developmental and regulatory policies which focus on carrying forward the initiatives taken for strengthening the financial system and for efficiently providing financial services to the widest sections of society. Let me briefly indicate some of the important initiatives in this regard. I will begin with financial markets and market infrastructure. Some important measures contained in the policy are the following: The settlement cycle of the primary auction in Treasury Bills (T-Bills) will be reduced from T+2 to T+1. IRS contracts will be standardised to facilitate centralised clearing and settlement of these contracts. We will move towards developing a trade repository for OTC derivatives. Now let me move on to initiatives for financial inclusion, credit delivery and customer service. Drawing on extensive consultation with banks, we have rationalised the guidelines on priority sector lending. Important initiatives in this regard are the following: Loans up to 20 million to partnership firms, cooperatives and corporates directly engaged in agriculture and allied activities under partnership, rural co- operative and corporate categories will also be classified as direct finance to agriculture. Bank loans to Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) for on-lending for housing up to 1 million per borrower will be included under the priority sector, provided the interest rate charged to the ultimate borrower by the HFC does not exceed two percentage points above the lowest interest rate of the lending bank for housing loans. As regards the cooperative sector, scheduled urban cooperative banks (UCBs) have been allowed to undertake repo transactions in corporate bonds. Another important step relates to micro and small enterprises. The definition of sickness of these enterprises is modified to facilitate early rehabilitation of potentially viable sick units and to lay down a procedure for assessing viability of sick units in the sector. Moving on to regulation and supervision, we are carrying forward the implementation of Basel III capital regulations by issuing draft guidelines on capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties by mid-November 2012 and on composition of capital disclosure requirements by end-December 2012. Given the larger objectives of financial stability, and keeping in view international best practices to ensure that banks have sufficient provisioning buffer, the provision for restructured standard accounts is being raised from the existing 2 per cent to 2.75 per cent. To address the issue of rise in NPAs and restructured advances of banks, and with a view to improving effective information sharing among banks on credit, derivatives and unhedged foreign currency exposures, banks are being advised to put7 in place, by end-December 2012, an effective mechanism for information sharing. Any sanction of fresh loans/ad-hoc loans/renewal of loans to new or existing borrowers with effect from January 1, 2013 should be made only after obtaining/sharing necessary information. Turning to unhedged foreign currency exposures of corporates, which is a source of risk to them as well as to the financing banks and the financial system, we are advising banks to put in place a proper mechanism to rigorously evaluate the risks arising out of unhedged foreign currency exposures of corporates, and price them in the credit risk premium. Banks are also being advised to consider stipulating a limit on the unhedged position of corporates on the basis of bank's Board-approved policy. We are in the process of strengthening the regulatory framework for dealing with Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) which may come under stress and may require resolution. Accordingly, the Government and the Reserve Bank are setting up a High Level Working Group to recommend a comprehensive resolution regime for all types of financial institutions in India. Before I close, let me note that the persistence of inflation pressures, even as growth has moderated, remains a key challenge. Of particular concern is the stickiness of core inflation, mainly on account of supply constraints and the cost-push of rupee depreciation. Consequently, managing inflation and inflation expectations must remain the primary focus of monetary policy. A central premise of monetary policy is that low and stable inflation and well-anchored inflation expectations contribute to a conducive investment climate and consumer confidence, which is key to sustained growth on a higher trajectory in the medium-term. Accordingly, over the past few quarters, monetary policy had to focus on inflation, even as growth risks have increased. As recent policy initiatives by the Government start yielding results in terms of revitalising activity, they will open up space for monetary policy to work in concert to stimulate growth. However, in doing so, it is important not to lose sight of the primary objective of managing inflation and inflation expectations. Thank you for your attention. On behalf of the Reserve Bank, my best wishes to everyone for a Happy Diwali. Alpana Killawala Press Release : 2012-2013/713 Chief General Manager."
Czech Republic,2012-11-01,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 7th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 1 November 2012 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided to lower the two-week repo rate by 0.20 percentage point to 0.05%. At the same time it decided to lower the Lombard rate by 0.50 percentage point to 0.25% and to lower the discount rate by 0.05 percentage point to 0.05%. Five members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for leaving interest rates unchanged. The rates will remain at this level over a longer horizon until inflation pressures increase significantly. Reasons for the decision Next year, headline inflation will be slightly above the CNB's inflation target owing to tax changes, whereas monetary-policy relevant inflation will be in the lower half of the tolerance band over the whole forecast horizon including the monetary policy horizon. Consistent with the forecast is a decline in market interest rates, followed by a rise in rates in 2014. The message of the forecast baseline scenario Tax changes and gradually fading growth in import and food prices are the sources of observed inflation. Headline inflation will be slightly above the CNB's inflation target owing to tax changes next year, whereas monetary-policy relevant inflation will be in the lower half of the tolerance band over the whole forecast horizon. The Czech economy will fall by 0.9% this year as a result of a marked slowdown in external demand and subdued domestic demand. Next year, when a gradual recovery in external demand and restrictive impacts of domestic fiscal consolidation will act in the opposite direction. GDP will grow by 0.2%. The koruna exchange rate to the euro is roughly stable over the forecast horizon. Consistent with the forecast is a decline in market interest rates, followed by a rise in rates in 2014. 13 Suspension of sales of investment income on international reserves Today the Board also decided to suspend the programme of sales of part of the CNB's investment income on international reserves. This decision was motivated by the fact that a conflict cannot be ruled out between these operations and monetary policy implementation in a situation where monetary policy interest rates are technically at zero. 14 Thank you for your attention More information about the forecast can be found at and in Inflation Report IV/2012, to be published 9 November 2012."
Romania,2012-11-02,"The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference on 7 November 2012. The annual inflation rate picked up in September 2012, reaching 5.33 percent from 3.88 percent in August 2012, mainly as a result of transitory unfavourable effects coming from domestic and global food prices, which added to the adverse statistical base effects and the local currency depreciation signalled in the previous NBR Reports. Nevertheless, the average consumer price increase over the last 12 months was 3.0 percent in September 2012, staying close to the European Union average. The materialisation of risks highlighted by the central bank's previous forecasts is also reflected, to a relatively lesser extent, by the evolution of the annual adjusted CORE21 inflation rate, which rose to 3.01 percent in September from 2.56 percent in the previous month. The recent developments in relevant indicators show a relative slowdown in economic activity in the second half of the year amid a drought-induced drop in agricultural production and deteriorating growth prospects for global and European economic activity. The persistence of a considerable negative output gap is softening, however, the magnitude of the unfavourable impact of higher global commodity prices and leu exchange rate movements on inflation. The external environment features a relative consolidation in investor confidence, as a result of measures implemented by major central banks. The global context remains nevertheless fraught with uncertainties surrounding the sustainable resolution of the euro area sovereign debt crisis and the European banking system developments. The monetary policy stance has aimed to anchor inflation expectations in the context of the transitory inflation bout, of heightened volatility of capital flows and the developments in exchange rates. Under the circumstances, tightening liquidity management in the banking sector was reflected by the rise in interbank rates and their consolidation around the monetary policy rate. The expansion in lending to the private sector has further weakened, with a slowdown especially in the real annual growth of foreign currency credit. In today's meeting, the NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses developments in the recent macroeconomic environment, inflation and its outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the period ahead. According to the report, the projected annual inflation rate was subject to revision under the temporary unfavourable impact of severe supply-side shocks. Thus, the updated projection underscores the prospect for the annual inflation rate to exceed the variation band around the central target (3.00 percent for 2012 and 2.5 percent starting 2013) by the second half of 2013 and thereafter to return and consolidate inside the variation band. The major risks associated with the new forecast relate to a potential increase in capital flow volatility, amid a possible deterioration of the external environment, entailing unfavourable consequences on emerging economies. The domestic electoral context in the period ahead can also overlap with these medium-term risks. In this context and with a view to efficiently anchoring inflation expectations, the NBR Board has decided to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged at 5.25 percent per annum, to ensure a firm liquidity management in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The adjustment of the monetary policy stance aims to calibrate the monetary policy instruments in order to contain potential second-round effects of adverse supply-side shocks and to pave the way for the inflation rate to return inside the variation band around the central target over the medium term. This policy conduct, together with a consistent implementation of balanced macroeconomic policies, will create the necessary prerequisites for sustainable, lasting economic recovery. In this context, the NBR Board restates that achieving price and financial stability objectives in the context of the ongoing fulfilment of commitments under the external financial arrangements with the European Union, the IMF and other international financial institutions, is crucial to support lasting economic growth. The NBR closely monitors domestic and global economic developments so as to ensure, via an optimal dosage of its instruments, the fulfilment of its objectives to achieve price stability over the medium term and to maintain financial stability. The quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for 7 November 2012. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 7 January 2013. 1 Calculated by the NBR by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, as well as tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index.

Poland,2012-11-07,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 7 November 2012 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 6-7 November 2012 The Council decided to decrease the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points:  reference rate to 4.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate to 6.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate to 3.00% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate to 4.75% on an annual basis; Incoming data indicate that global economic activity remained subdued in 2012 Q3. In the euro area, economic growth was probably close to zero, and in the United States, despite some rebound, remained moderate. At the same time, following several quarters of economic slowdown, growth in the largest emerging economies probably stabilised at a relatively low level. Even though weak economic activity across the world contributes to a decline in inflation, still relatively high commodity prices are conducive to inflation remaining elevated in many countries. Following the earlier improvement, the international financial market sentiment has deteriorated slightly. At the same time, some central banks have lowered their policy rates. In Poland, both industrial output and retail sales (in real terms) declined in September, while the fall in construction and assembly output deepened. Economic activity data were worse than expected and reflected further economic slowdown in 2012 Q3. Furthermore, labour market figures, including continued decline in employment, slower wage growth in the enterprise sector and gradually rising unemployment rate, point to a lack of wage pressure and likely further weakening in private demand. This is also confirmed by deteriorating of most business indicators. The economic slowdown is accompanied by a gradual deceleration in lending to households, including a further decrease in the consumer loans, as well as slower growth in corporate lending. In September. CPI inflation was 3.8%, remaining above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. At the same time, both core inflation and producer price growth continued to decline, which confirms that demand pressure is weakening. Household and corporate inflation expectations also declined in the recent months. The Council got acquainted with the inflation and GDP projection prepared by the Economic Institute, being one of the inputs to the Council's decisions on the NBP interest rates. 00-919 Warszawa, ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, tel. (22) 653 28 88, fax (22) 653 13 28 In line with the November projection based on the NECMOD model  assuming unchanged NBP interest rates  there is a 50-percent probability of inflation running in the range of 3.7- 3.9% in 2012 (as compared to 3.6-4.2% in the July projection), within 1.8-3.1% in 2013 (as against 2.0-3.4%) and between 0.7-2.4% in 2014 (as against 1.0-2.7%). The annual GDP growth  in line with the November projection  will be, with a 50-percent probability, contained within 2.0-2.6% in 2012 (as compared to 2.3-3.6% in the July projection), within 0.5-2.5% in 2013 (as against 1.0-3.2%) and within 1.1-3.5% in 2014 (as against 1.7-4.2%). In the opinion of the Council, incoming data confirm a considerable economic slowdown in Poland, which contains wage and inflationary pressure. At the same time, in line with the November projection prepared under the assumption of constant NBP interest rates. GDP growth will remain below potential in the coming years. According to the projection, inflation will return to the target in the coming quarters, and might fall below the target in the medium term. Therefore, the Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates. The decrease in the interest rates should support economic activity and thus reduces the risk of inflation falling below the target in the medium term. Should the incoming information confirm a protracted economic slowdown, and should the risk of increase in inflationary pressure remain limited, the Council will further ease monetary policy. The Council adopted the Inflation Report - November 2012."
Euroarea,2012-11-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Owing to high energy prices and increases in indirect taxes in some euro area countries, inflation rates are likely to remain above 2% for the remainder of 2012. They are expected to fall below that level in the course of next year and to remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Consistent with this picture, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Economic activity in the euro area is expected to remain weak, although it continues to be supported by our monetary policy stance and financial market confidence has visibly improved on the back of our decisions as regards Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs). At the same time, the necessary process of balance sheet adjustment in large parts of the financial and non-financial sectors as well as high uncertainty continue to weigh on the economic outlook. It is essential for governments to support confidence by forcefully implementing the necessary steps to reduce both fiscal and structural imbalances and to proceed with financial sector restructuring. The Governing Council remains firmly committed to preserving the singleness of its monetary policy and to ensuring the proper transmission of the policy stance to the real economy throughout the euro area. As we said before, we are ready to undertake OMTs, which will help to avoid extreme scenarios, thereby clearly reducing concerns about the materialisation of destructive forces. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP contracted by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2012, following flat growth in the previous quarter. As regards the second half of 2012, the available indicators continue to signal weak activity. While industrial production data showed some resilience in July/August, most recent survey evidence for the economy as a whole, extending into the fourth quarter, does not signal improvements towards the end of the year. Looking ahead to next year, the growth momentum is expected to remain weak. It continues to be supported by our standard and non-standard monetary policy measures, but the necessary process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors and an uneven global recovery will continue to dampen the pace of recovery. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside. Euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in October 2012, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, compared with 2.6% in September and August. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates could remain at elevated levels, before declining to below 2% again in the course of next year. Over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of modest growth in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain moderate. We will continue to monitor closely further developments in costs, wages and prices. Risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be broadly balanced over the medium term. Upside risks pertain to further increases in indirect taxes owing to the need for fiscal consolidation. The main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area, in the event of a renewed intensification of financial market tensions, and its effects on the domestic components of inflation. Turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. In September the annual growth rate of M3 decreased to 2.7%, from 2.8% in August. Monthly outflows from M3 reflected to some extent the reversal of portfolio shifts into the most liquid components of M3. Accordingly, the annual rate of growth of M1 declined to 5.0% in September, from 5.2% in August. At the same time, we have observed a strengthening in the deposit base of banks in some stressed countries, amid improvements in investors' confidence in the euro area. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) declined further to -0.4% in September, from -0.2% in August. This development was mainly due to further net redemptions in loans to non-financial corporations, which led to an annual rate of decline in these loans of -1.2%, compared with -0.5% in August. The annual growth in MFI lending to households remained unchanged at 0.9% in September. To a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the weak outlook for GDP, heightened risk aversion and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises, all of which weigh on credit demand. At the same time, in a number of euro area countries, the segmentation of financial markets and capital constraints for banks restrict credit supply. The recent results of the bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2012 underpin this assessment. The soundness of banks' balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels, thereby contributing to an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions of the non-financial sectors in the individual countries of the euro area. It is thus essential that the resilience of banks continues to be strengthened where needed. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. Other economic policy areas need to make substantial contributions to ensure a further stabilisation of financial markets and an improvement in the outlook for growth. Structural reforms are crucial to boost the growth potential of euro area countries and to enhance employment. Policy action is also necessary to increase the adjustment capacity of euro area economies in order to complete the ongoing process of unwinding existing imbalances. Visible progress is being made in the correction of unit labour costs and current account imbalances. However, further measures to enhance labour market flexibility and labour mobility across the euro area are warranted. Such structural measures would also complement and support fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability. As regards fiscal policies, there is clear evidence that consolidation efforts in euro area countries are bearing fruit. It is crucial that efforts are maintained to restore sound fiscal positions, in line with the commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact and the 2012 European Semester recommendations. Full compliance with the reinforced EU fiscal and governance framework, including the rapid implementation of the fiscal compact, will send a strong signal to markets and strengthen confidence in the soundness of public finances. The Governing Council takes note of the European Council conclusions on completing Economic and Monetary Union, adopted on 18 October 2012. In the context of measures to achieve an integrated financial framework, it welcomes in particular the objective of agreeing on the legislative framework for a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) by 1 January 2013 with a view to the SSM becoming operational in the course of 2013."
Malaysia,2012-11-08,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy is expected to continue to experience slow growth. There continues to be uncertainties surrounding the growth prospects of the advanced economies. However, despite the weaker external demand, growth in the regional economies remains supported by domestic demand. In the Malaysian economy, the sustained expansion in domestic activity has offset the weaknesses in the external sector. Looking ahead, private consumption will be supported by the income growth and stable employment conditions. Investment is expected to remain firm, led by increased capital spending in the domestic-oriented sectors, the oil and gas sector and the on-going implementation of infrastructure projects. Headline inflation is expected to remain moderate for the remainder of 2012. While inflation may increase in 2013, it is expected to remain modest given the excess capacity in the economy. Global energy and commodity prices are also likely to be contained given the weak global conditions. Upside risks to inflation could however emerge in the event of supply disruptions that results in higher global prices for commodities. The MPC considers the current stance of monetary policy to be accommodative and supportive of the economy. In addition to domestic conditions, the MPC will continue to carefully assess the global economic and financial developments and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy. The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2013. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times a year. The meetings will be held over two days, with the Monetary Policy Statement released at 6 p.m. on the second day of the MPC meeting1. ____________________________________ 1This has been the practice since January 2010 following the coming into force of the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009.

South Korea,2012-11-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the moderate economic recovery in the US to have continued, but the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have persisted. Some economic indicators in emerging market countries have shown signs of improving. The Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be very modest going forward and judges the downside risks to growth to be large, owing chiefly to the euro area fiscal crisis and to the fiscal consolidation issue in the US. In Korea, the Committee appraises economic growth to have still been weak, although exports appear to be emerging from their downtrend and consumption and investment have turned around to increases. On the employment front, amid its continued uptrend led by the higher age groups and the service industry, the number of persons employed has increased by a greater margin in the manufacturing sector as well. Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will persist for a considerable time, due mostly to the prolongation of the euro area fiscal crisis and to the delay in recovery of the global economy. October consumer price inflation and core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products continued to run at similarly low levels as in the previous month, at 2.1% and 1.5% respectively. The Committee forecasts that inflation will not deviate substantially from its current level for the time being, owing 1 primarily to the easing of demand-side pressures and despite the influence for example of international grain price instability. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas continued their downtrend and those in the rest of the country rose slightly, while the uptrend in leasehold deposit prices picked up owing mainly to seasonal factors. In the financial markets, stock prices fell substantially due mostly to the worsening of economic forecasts and to concerns about lackluster corporate performance, and the Korean won sustained its strength against the US dollar owing chiefly to the easing of international financial market unrest and to the current account surplus. Long-term market interest rates fluctuated somewhat at around their levels at end-September, a result of the fact that the Base Rate cut expected in October had already been priced into these levels. Looking ahead, the Committee will closely monitor external risk factors and the consequent changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the inflation target over a medium-term horizon while continuing its efforts to lower inflation expectations and ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded."
Russia,2012-11-09,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 9 November 2012 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain the refinancing rate and the interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations unchanged (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects. In October and in the beginning of November the pace of inflation declined slightly, but stayed above the target range, and as of 6 of November was estimated at 6.4% over a year ago. Core inflation in October amounted to 5.8%. Stabilization was registered in all the main components of the consumer price index, including food prices, that were the key driver of inflation acceleration in recent months. Taking into account its influence on economic agents' expectations, the recent growth in inflation rate remains an important source of inflation risks. Nevertheless, the deceleration of certain food prices growth and the September 2012 hike in the interest rates on the Bank of Russia monetary policy instruments could contribute to the moderation of inflation expectations. At the same time significant demand-pull price pressures are absent. The dynamics of the key macroeconomic indicators in September were in line with the previous trends, pointing to a certain slowdown in economic activity. Consumer demand and industrial production growth rates were largely unchanged while investment growth continued to decelerate. However, economic confidence indicators on the whole remained positive in the recent months and labour market conditions together with credit expansion support robust domestic demand. Despite the slower economic growth observed in the second half of the year gross output remains close to its potential level, according to the Bank of Russia estimates. Banking credit growth continued to show certain signs of the stabilization. However, the risks of a significant economic slowdown stemming from somewhat tighter monetary conditions are considered minor. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks, including global food price dynamics, global economic developments and the consequences of the monetary conditions tightening for the Russian economy. In making monetary policy decisions the Bank of Russia will be guided by medium-term inflation goals and economic growth prospects, as well as the dynamics of inflation expectations. The next meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the first decade of December 2012. Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations.

Armenia,2012-11-12,"Press Release 11.12.2012 Interest rate unchanged, 8 percent In the December 11th of 2012 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. There was 1.4 percent inflation recorded in November of 2012, and the 12-month inflation has been 3.6 percent, closer to the confidence band. The Board admitted that macroeconomic developments in November were mostly in compliance with the baseline scenario in the fourth quarter's Monetary Policy Program. In the external sector uncertainties over political solutions regarding debt problems in developed countries are persisting in which context the global demand is predicted to be weak in the forecast horizon. Yet fundamental tightness will continue in world food markets. Under such conditions, the impact of the external sector on domestic prices will be minor inflationary. In the period October-November growth rates in private spending remained strong, and non-commercial transfers of individuals reported high growth. In the meantime, the fiscal policy's impact on aggregate demand has been predominantly contractionary. As a result, the influence expected from the Armenian economy on domestic prices proved minor inflationary. In view of the actual 12-month inflation behavior as well as persisting weak inflationary environment in the prospect of developments in external sector and domestic economy, the Board finds it reasonable to further withhold from changing the refinancing rate in December. In this circumstance, the 12-month inflation will come closer to the 4 percent target and will stay around that level in the forecast horizon. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in the Minutes on Interest Rate due on December 21 2012. The Central Bank Public Relations."
Chile,2012-11-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 November 2012 Press Release(cid:31) * In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). Internationally, uncertainty persists about the fiscal and financial situation in the Eurozone, as does the risk of a sharp fiscal adjustment in the United States. Global financial conditions are somewhat tighter than they were a month ago and the dollar has appreciated in international markets. A resurgence of fiscal and financial tensions in the coming months cannot be ruled out. Incoming information confirms weak growth in developed economies, while more positive signals are observed in some emerging economies. The prices of fuels and metals—including copper—have declined. Domestically, output and demand indicators have evolved above projections. The labor market remains tight. The high CPI variation of October obeyed to one- time factors. Y-o-y inflation is around 3%, while core inflation measures remain below 3%. Inflation expectations over the policy horizon are aligned with the target. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook."
Peru,2012-11-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR NOVEMBER 2012 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based on the fact that inflation's deviation from the target has reflected temporary factors on the side of supply in a domestic context characterized by an economic pace of growth close to the economy's potential rate of growth and in an external context still characterized by high uncertainty. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider future adjustments in monetary policy instruments. Inflation in October registered a monthly rate of -0.16 percent, a lower rate than in September due mainly to the reversal of the prices of perishable food products. As a result of this, inflation in the last 12 months fell from 3.74 percent in September to 3.25 percent in October. Core inflation showed a rate of 0.13 percent in October and thus accumulated a rate of 3.32 percent in the last 12 months, a lower rate than in the previous month. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a monthly rate of -0.04 percent and an annual rate of 1.99 percent. Supply conditions for perishable food products improved in October, which contributed to the reversal of the supply shocks that had been affecting inflation transitorily. As a result of this, inflation should return to the target range and gradually converge towards the 2 percent target. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show that the economy's growth has stabilized around its long-term sustainable level of growth, although the indicators associated with the external market still register a weak performance. On the other hand, indicators of global economic activity show that uncertainty regarding the pace of global economic activity remains. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Monetary Program for December will be approved on the Board's session that will be held on December 6, 2012."
Nigeria,2012-11-19,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 86 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of Monday and Tuesday November 19 and 20, 2012 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met with nine out of the twelve members in attendance. The Committee reviewed the domestic and global economic conditions and financial environment as well as the challenges that faced the Nigerian economy during the first ten months of fiscal 2012, with a view to reassessing monetary policy options in the near-to-medium term. The International Economic Situation The Committee noted the continued deceleration in global output, which resulted from a combination of austerity-driven euro-zone developments, weak recovery in some Asian economies, and slowdown in major emerging market economies. In addition, high and rising unemployment, fragile financial conditions, weak housing markets, and deterioration in both public and private sector balance sheets in some major industrial countries posed major risks to global economic recovery. Thus global output growth in 2012, which was earlier projected at 35 per cent in July 2012 by the IMF, was revised downward to 33 per cent in the October 2012 World Economic Outlook; that of 2013 was also revised downward from 39 to 36 per cent. According to the October 2012 projection, there is a high probability of global growth falling below 20 per cent in 2012 and this would mirror the recession in the advanced economies and the slowing output growth in key emerging markets and developing economies. Thus global output growth in 2012, which was earlier projected at 35 per cent in July 2012 by the IMF was revised downward to 33 per cent in the October 2012 World Economic Outlook; that of 2013 was also revised downward from 39 to 36 per cent. Growth in the advanced economies is estimated at 13 per cent in 2012 and 16 per cent in 2013, reflecting a downward revision of 01 and 03 percentage point, respectively. The US economy continued on the path of modest recovery as real output expanded by 20 per cent in the third quarter of 2012 compared with 13 per cent in the second quarter, reflecting the positive contributions from personal consumption expenditure, government spending, private inventory and residential housing investment in the face of current low mortgage rates. However the recent hurricane Sandy across the east coast of the United States, constitutes an immediate risk to the sustainability of the recent growth rally and its impact is expected to truncate US recovery in the last quarter of 2012. Another major risk to the medium term growth trajectory is the US “fiscal cliff”. The IMF has suggested a gradual resolution of the fiscal impasse in order to avoid the possibility of a sharp contraction. The US economy continued on the path of modest recovery as real output expanded by 20 per cent in the third quarter of 2012 compared with 13 per cent in the second quarter, reflecting the positive contributions from personal consumption expenditure, government spending, private inventory 2 and residential housing investment in the face of current low mortgage rates. The Euro zone is officially in recession in addition to the persisting uncertainty over agreements on a fiscal union, the start of European Central Bank's (ECB) oversight of European banks and the fragility of the Greek. Spanish and other peripheral economies. Real GDP in the zone is projected to contract by 04 per cent in 2012 with unemployment rising to 1150 per cent. The core economies in the zone are expected to experience low but positive growth during 2012-13 while most economies in the periphery are expected to suffer sharp output contraction in 2012 because of tight fiscal policies and weak financial conditions. The German economy recorded slight recovery with unemployment falling to 65 per cent while the United Kingdom snapped out of a recession, recording a growth rate of 10 per cent after three successive quarters of contraction. Rising uncertainty about the viability of the Euro zone and the possibility that the euro area crisis will escalate remains a major downside risk to growth and financial sector stability. Overall continued austerity measures in the euro area are having negative spill-over effect on the German economy which is now wobbling on the verge of a recession due to widespread drop in aggregate demand. In emerging Asia, growth was estimated to have significantly weakened to less than 7 per cent in the first half of 2012. Latest data indicate that growth in China slowed for the seventh consecutive quarter to 740 per cent in Q3, 2012, lower than the Q2, 2012 figure of 760 per cent. The Peoples Bank of China (PBC) had already embarked on sequential monetary easing operations in order to loosen liquidity conditions and stimulate growth. This will, however, increase the risk of inflating real estate prices and a possible bubble with potential adverse impact on the Chinese financial system. In India, output is expected to expand by 580 per cent in 2012 as against 650 per cent in 2011 with the slowdown resulting from waning business confidence, sluggish structural reforms, policy rate hikes designed to rein in inflation, and flagging external demand. In other parts of Asia, growth has dipped, hampered by the weak performance of the Chinese economy. Most countries continue to be affected by weak export growth while the Monetary Authorities have responded with expansionary monetary policy. Output growth for 2012, at 51 per cent, up from 33 per cent in 2011for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, could be considered robust in the face of global realities, but there is a sharp difference in growth performance between the oil and non-oil exporting countries in the region. For the non-oil exporting economies, growth is projected to register just above 20 per cent and 66 per cent for the oil exporting economies. Economic activities in the non-oil exporting countries have remained suppressed by the growth deceleration in the major trading partner-economies, internal conflicts and pervading political/economic uncertainties. The robust growth projection for the oil exporting countries, on the other hand, is anchored on increased government expenditure supported by historically high oil prices. Despite these developments, the Committee is of the view that growth for the MENA Region in the medium term is faced with the risk of weak external demand, instability in the region and an increasingly constrained environment for private sector activity. However Africa's robust growth is not likely to affect the downward trend in global output because of its small share (27 %) of global output. Overall the Committee believes that the fiscal gridlock in the US, the lingering euro zone financial and economic crisis, as well as the softening output growth in the key emerging Asian economies, could have serious implications for the domestic economy in the near-to-medium term. Specifically any negative shock to the current high prices of crude oil would have adverse implications for fiscal revenue flows and the external current account position, even though current forecasts and developments in the Middle East do not suggest the possibility of a shock in the near term. Overall continued austerity measures in the euro area are having negative spill-over effect on the German economy which is now wobbling on the verge of a recession due to widespread drop in aggregate demand. 3 In emerging Asia, growth was estimated to have significantly weakened to less than 7 per cent in the first half of 2012. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output The National Bureau of Statistics has revised the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for fiscal 2012 downwards to 661 per cent from the earlier projection of 685 per cent, indicating that the economy is encountering growth challenges not previously anticipated. The estimates revealed a real GDP growth rate of 648 per cent in the third quarter of 2012, up from 639 per cent in the second quarter but lower than the 737 per cent recorded in the corresponding period of 2011. The non-oil sector remained t The Committee noted with concern the continuing decline in the contribution of the oil sector to growth, in an area of strong oil price performance, which became apparent in the last half of 2011 and also the decline in the contribution of agriculture to growth since Q3, 2011, in spite of the investment in the Agricultural transformation initiatives of the Federal Government. Despite these developments, the Committee is of the view that growth for the MENA Region in the medium term is faced with the risk of weak external demand, instability in the region and an increasingly constrained environment for private sector 4 activity. The relatively robust growth projections for 2012 despite the slowdown in the global economy reflected the continuing favorable conditions for increased agricultural production, the impact of the banking sector reforms and the initiatives by government to stimulate the real economy. In this regard, the Committee welcomed the recent improvements in electricity generation which has impacted positively on manufacturing activities and overall capacity utilization. The Committee enjoined the Federal Government to sustain the efforts. The Committee, however, observed that the recent flooding in several parts of the country, current security challenges and corruption scandals posed serious downside risks to growth in the near-to-medium term. Indeed it noted that the full impact of the widespread flooding was yet to manifest while the cost to the economy was yet to be estimated. The committee noted the combined effects of the high tariffs, floods and drought on global wheat supplies which have led to higher prices of wheat in Nigeria. The non-oil sector remained t The Committee noted with concern the continuing decline in the contribution of the oil sector to growth, in an area of strong oil price performance, which became apparent in the last half of 2011 and also the decline in the contribution of agriculture to growth since Q3, 2011, in spite of the investment in the Agricultural transformation initiatives of the Federal Government. 5 The relatively robust growth projections for 2012 despite the slowdown in the global economy reflected the continuing favorable conditions for increased agricultural production, the impact of the banking sector reforms and the initiatives by government to stimulate the real economy. Prices The Committee noted that inflationary pressure, which moderated in the third quarter of 2012, re-emerged in October 2012. The year-on- year headline inflation inched up to 1170 per cent in October 2012 from 113 per cent in September while food inflation increased to 111 per cent from 102 per cent in September. Core inflation continued its sequential four-month moderation to 1240 per cent from 1310 per cent in September while the risk of food inflation remained hawkish, thus creating mixed price signals. The major drivers of inflation during the period include food and housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels. The pick-up in food inflation contradicted recent trends and may not be unconnected with effects of the floods on farmlands, the impact of which poses an upside risk to inflation in the near-term, coupled with continued imported food inflation. Although core inflation continued its moderation, the Committee considered the current level to still be elevated, driven largely by: processed foods (37 per cent); housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels (42 per cent); clothing and footwear (14 per cent); transport (110 per cent); furnishing, household equipment and housing maintenance (07 per cent); and education (06 per cent). However the major drivers of core inflation remained outside the scope of monetary policy alone which was helpless in addressing the structural components of inflation. In the meantime, fuel prices have risen generally above the official pump price even without the total removal of oil subsidy. Monetary Credit and Financial Markets Developments Broad money supply (M2) grew by 823 per cent in October 2012 over the level at end-December, 2011, which annualizes to 987 per cent. Aggregate domestic credit (net) declined by 348 per cent in October 2012. The decline in credit to government between June and October implies that the Federal Government is increasingly becoming a net creditor to the banking system which perhaps reflects the impact of better fiscal management including the introduction of Treasury Single Account. The year-on-year headline inflation inched up to 1170 per cent in October 2012 from 113 per cent in September while food inflation increased to 111 per cent from 102 per cent in September. The pick-up in food inflation contradicted recent trends and may not be unconnected with effects of the floods on farmlands, the impact of which poses an upside risk to inflation in the near-term, coupled with continued 6 imported food inflation. Interest rates in all segments of the money market moderated between September 19 and October 30, 2012, reflecting increased liquidity in the banking system induced by the release of statutory revenue to sub-national governments, the repayments of matured CBN bills and absence of repo operations during the review period. The decline in credit to government between June and October, implies that the Federal Government is increasingly becoming a net creditor to the banking system which perhaps reflects the impact of better fiscal management including the introduction of Treasury Single Account. The interbank call and OBB rates, which opened at 1677 and 1640 per cent on September 19, 2012, closed at 1203 and 1170 per cent, respectively, on October 30, 2012. The average interbank call and OBB rates for the period were 1168 and 1138 per cent, respectively. The average interbank call and OBB rates for the period were 1168 and 1138 per cent, respectively. 7 The foregoing notwithstanding, the Committee was concerned that the moderation in money market rates was only beneficial to prime customers, who enjoyed a fair degree of reduction in rates on their loan facilities. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Committee was concerned that the moderation in money market rates was only beneficial to prime customers, who enjoyed a fair degree of reduction in rates on their loan facilities. The average prime lending rate declined from 1696 per cent in July to 1648 per cent in October. The average maximum lending rate, however, increased from 2345 to 2465 per cent during the period while the weighted average savings and term deposit rate stabilized at 530 per cent during the period. The Committee, therefore enjoined the Bank to fast track the financial inclusion strategy to ensure the effectiveness of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy with a view to improving the financial intermediation process, and reducing the high spread between deposit and lending rates in the banking industry. The Committee observed that the rally in the Nigerian capital market continued as equities market indicators trended upward in the review period. The average wDAS exchange rate during the period was N15733/US$. At the BDC segment of the foreign exchange market, the selling rate opened at N16100/US$ on August 30, 2012 and closed at N15900/US$ on October 31, 2012, representing an appreciation of N200k or 124 per cent for 8 the period. Market Capitalization (MC) also increased, by 2215 per cent, from N690 trillion to N842 trillion during the same period. The positive performance of the ASI and MC were due to strong investor confidence following improved second quarter financial performance of blue-chip companies, as well as excellent results from a reinvigorated banking industry. External Sector Developments At the Wholesale Dutch Auction System (wDAS), the exchange rate during the review period opened at N15736/US$ on August 30, 2012 and closed at N15730/US$ on October 31, 2012, representing an appreciation of N006k or 004 per cent. The average wDAS exchange rate during the period was N15733/US$. At the BDC segment of the foreign exchange market, the selling rate opened at N16100/US$ on August 30, 2012 and closed at N15900/US$ on October 31, 2012, representing an appreciation of N200k or 124 per cent for the period. At the interbank segment, the selling rate opened at N15810/US$ on August 30, 2012 and closed at N15706/US$ on October 31, 2012, representing an appreciation of N104k or 066 per cent. The appreciation recorded in all segments of the market could be traced to the combined effects of tight monetary conditions, improved supply of foreign exchange to the market by oil companies; increased inflows from portfolio investors and the policy that barred the DMBs from accessing the CBN Lending window (SLF and Repo) and wDAS simultaneously. The Committee urged the Central Bank to continue to monitor the inflow and destination of FDIs and remittances conscious of the risks to financial stability of a rapid outflow of hot money. 9 The Committee's Considerations The Committee noted that developments in the global economy characterized by general uncertainty on the back of the deceleration in global growth sustained by the fragile financial conditions, weakening labor and housing markets and deteriorating public and private balance sheets across advanced and emerging economies, have implications for the domestic economy and, therefore, demand careful consideration in arriving at an appropriate decision of monetary policy. The Committee noted with satisfaction the premia between the rates at the wDAS and the interbank and between the wDAS and the BDCs narrowed towards the end of the review period, from N074/US$ and N364/US$ to N003/US$ and N168/US$, respectively, suggesting the need to sustain and further complement existing measures to discourage speculative activities in the foreign exchange market. In general, the Committee noted that the decisions taken at the previous MPC meetings were yielding the desired results. The Committee expressed satisfaction with the significant accretion to external reserves which stood at US$ 4568 billion as at November 15, 2012, representing an increase of US$ 1027 billion or about 2900 per cent from the level of US$3541 billion at end-June 2012. External reserves had increased by US$ 1304 billion or 3995 per cent over the December 2011 level of US$ 3264 billion. The increase in the foreign reserves level was driven mainly by proceeds from crude oil and gas sales and crude oil-related taxes, as well as reduced funding of the wDAS due to increase inflow of foreign direct investment. The foreign reserves level could finance over 10 months of imports. The Committee urged the Central Bank to continue to monitor the inflow and destination of FDIs and remittances conscious of the risks to financial stability of a rapid outflow of hot money. Furthermore the Committee observed that while there were compelling arguments for monetary easing at this time based on the continuous 10 moderation of core inflation, slowdown in GDP growth and evidence of fiscal prudence, the short-term gains may not be sufficiently adequate to overturn the long term implications of sending a wrong signal that the tightening cycle was permanently over. The Committee's Considerations The Committee noted that developments in the global economy characterized by general uncertainty on the back of the deceleration in global growth sustained by the fragile financial conditions, weakening labor and housing markets and deteriorating public and private balance sheets across advanced and emerging economies, have implications for the domestic economy and, therefore, demand careful consideration in arriving at an appropriate decision of monetary policy. The uncertainty surrounding the resolution of the fiscal cliff in the US and the downside risk created by Hurricane Sandy on US output in Q4 are also important factors to consider. The Committee noted that if the fiscal cliff was not resolved quickly, it would negatively impact the already ballooning deficits and subsequently tip the economy into a recession with downside risks to oil price developments. The Committee noted that the lack of clear direction for the resolution of the Euro area crises will continue to signal a likely recession in the area in the near term. Developments in the domestic economy in the past three months highlight some new pressure points to macroeconomic stability. The Committee was of the view that despite the high interest rates, additional shocks to the economy emanating from the devastating floods, imported inflation and the upward adjustment in electricity tariffs continue to stoke inflationary pressure. The Committee noted the conflicting price signals coming from the latest inflation numbers from the National Bureau of Statistics, with headline and food inflation trending upwards, while core inflation rate continued to moderate for the fourth consecutive month. This according to the Committee has created uncertainty as to the appropriate policy stance at this time. However since the factors underpinning the inflationary pressures were mainly structural, a monetary response may not be appropriate at this time. Furthermore the Committee observed that while there were compelling arguments for monetary easing at this time based on the continuous moderation of core inflation, slowdown in GDP growth and evidence of fiscal prudence, the short-term gains may not be sufficiently adequate to overturn the long term implications of sending a wrong signal that the tightening cycle was permanently over. In view of these developments, the Committee was faced with three choices: 11 An increase in rates in response to the up tick in headline and food inflation; A reduction in rates in view of declining core inflation and GDP growth; Retaining current monetary policy stance in view of conflicting price signals and global uncertainties; The Committee's Decisions The Committee considered and rejected option 1 as being potentially pro- cyclical considering the structural nature of recent inflationary pressures. With regard to the balance sheet of the Federal Government, the Committee was of the view that it has become imperative to shift away from looking at the size of the deficit and borrowing alone, to emphasizing the quality of expenditure and decisions on the allocation of resources. The Committee commended the fiscal authorities for keeping the fiscal deficit firmly in line with the 2012 budget and improving the revenue profile of the Federal Government by plugging several of the fiscal leakages. It called on the Government to significantly increase capital spending and increase its focus on improving on governance and transparency in the public service. On the oil price benchmark used in the 2013 budget, the MPC reaffirmed its support for the maintaining the US$75/barrel proposed by the fiscal authorities and noted that this has become even more critical in light of evidence that output projections may have been overly optimistic. In this regard, the Committee called on the Government and the National Assembly going forward, to borrow from the Chilean experience with regard to the setting of the parameters for the preparation of the National Budget to avoid the perennial rancor between the Executive and the Legislature on benchmark oil price. Specifically the Committee called for the setting up of an independent legal structure that will set the benchmark output and price underpinned by the long term trajectory of output and price, by independent experts who are shielded from political interference and interests. In view of these developments, the Committee was faced with three choices: An increase in rates in response to the up-tick in headline and food inflation; A reduction in rates in view of declining core inflation and GDP growth; Retaining current monetary policy stance in view of conflicting price signals and global uncertainties; The Committee's Decisions The Committee considered and rejected option 1 as being potentially pro-cyclical considering the structural nature of recent inflationary pressures. While acknowledging the merit of the arguments in favour of option 2, it was also rejected as likely to send wrong signals of a premature termination of an appropriately tight monetary stance. The Committee therefore, decided by a unanimous vote to maintain the current policy stance ie. to retain the MPR at 12 per cent with a corridor of +/- 200 basis points around the midpoint; and retain the CRR at 120 per cent and the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria 20 November, 2012 th 12. Thank you. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria 20th November, 2012 PERSONAL STATEMENTS BY MPC MEMBERS: 10 ALADE. SARAH Headline inflation increased marginally to 117 percent in October from 113 percent recorded in September. This increase is driven mainly by food inflation which edged up to 113 percent in October from 102 percent recorded in the previous month. In the international scene there are great uncertainties: while unemployment rate is trending downwards at 79 percent compared to 9 percent a year ago in the United States, concrete strategy to deal with the fiscal cliff have not been agreed on. In the Euro zone, the continued progress by the Euro zone ministers to tackle the Euro area debt problems has not yielded major breakthrough. On the domestic front, third quarter GDP growth remain robust at 648 percent, higher than 639 percent recorded in the second quarter. The major risks to monetary policy in the near to medium term would include inflationary implication of the recent unprecedented flood which could exacerbate the current precarious food inflation through food deficit. Additionally the risk of external shock is fairly high as a result of continuous moderation in global growth with severe implication for the buildup of external reserves. Although inflation increased marginally, this trend is a seasonal phenomenon and hiking policy rate at this time may be counterproductive. Headline inflation increased marginally to 117 percent in October from 113 percent recorded in the previous month. Headline inflation increase marginally driven mainly by increase in food inflation. High imported food prices couple with flood in some parts of the country is driving up food prices. While core inflation decreased from 131 percent in September to 124 percent, food inflation however increased from 102 percent to 111 percent. Staff projections suggest a temporary inflationary pressure in the coming months due to end of year spending. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is revised downward and is projected to grow by 661 percent in 2012 from the 678 previously projected. Third quarter GDP growth edged up to 648 percent from 639 recorded in the second quarter of the year. The non-oil sector grew by755 percent during the third quarter, decreasing marginally from 763 percent record in the second quarter. The contribution of agriculture decreased from 421 percent in the second quarter to 389 percent in the third quarter, further justifying the increased food inflationary pressure. The contribution of wholesale and retail trade increased from 865 percent to 962 percent. The outlook for growth in 2012 through the first quarter 2013 remains robust. Money market rates have remained stable. Money market rates maintained a fair degree of stability since September MPC meeting, remaining within the MPR corridor. In addition, the spread between the average maximum lending rate and consolidated Demand. Savings and Time deposit rates narrowed during the period between the last MPC meeting and October 2012. There has been a build-up in foreign reserves and stability of the foreign exchange. Monetary policy has been effective in stabilizing the foreign exchange market and reducing speculative demand. The past monetary policy decisions have also aided capital inflows to the economy, resulting in buildup of foreign exchange reserves which stood at $4568 billion as of November 15, 2012. However it is important to continue to monitor global events, especially the effect of the on-going Euro zone crisis and the handling of the fiscal cliff in the United State on the Naira, as either issue could destabilize the global economy and pose downside risk to the exchange rate. Although global economic environment is improving, some downside risk remains. Escalating tensions in the Middle East could put undue pressure on the fragile recovery of the global economy. While oil prices have remained high and stable, the supply side factors such as geo-political tension in Middle East could pose downside risk to growth recovery. Although there are some signs in the United States with moderate growth, improved unemployment numbers and recovery in the housing market, there are still some risks to global growth, as the Euro zone is quickly sliding into recession. In emerging markets, growth momentum is slowing. Although this could be a reason for monetary easing, these developments constitute a major risk to the domestic economy. In the event that such risk crystallizes, it would soften demand for crude oil, hence reduction in fiscal revenue and potential balance of payment challenges. It is expedient for policy makers to continue to monitor developments and put appropriate measures in place to cushion the adverse impact in the event of its crystallization. Based on the above. I am in support of the current stance of monetary policy to sustain improvements recorded in 2012 as well as mitigate some of the identified risks. Even with declining core inflation, there are still real inflationary threats in the coming months. will therefore support a no increase in Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) and Cash Reverse Requirement (CRR). .0 GARBA. ABDUL-GANIYU Decision I vote to hold. Justification 1. The game changing mix of policies and institutional and administrative changes implemented after the July MPC have been having desired policy impacts: interbank rates have stabilized within the policy band (±200 basis points around MPR), the exchange rate has remained stable and core inflation is trending down from 152% in June 2012 steadily every month to 117% in October 2012. As the year comes to an end, a major policy shift is not desirable. It is wise to stay the course more so, given the pervasive uncertainties in the global economy in fourth quarter of 2012 (failures of the EU to resolve its sovereign debt crisis) and in the first quarter of 2013 (fears of the US falling off the fiscal cliff). There are however, several global and domestic trends as well as the strategic behaviors of economic players deserve closer monitoring and rigorous analysis on a continuous basis. i. Global Outlook: the global trend of growth, employment, demand and food prices in fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 need to be closely monitored given (a) the deepening sovereign debt crisis in the EU, (b) the ongoing recessions in the EU. UK and Japan, (c) the slowing growth in China. India and Russia, the looming danger of the US falling off a “fiscal cliff”, (d) the supply shocks to agricultural output caused by the adverse weather conditions in the US and Russia in 2012; (e) the quantitative easing related low interest rates and excess liquidity which could lead to perverse and potentially damaging flows of financial capital to and from inefficient and less sophisticated markets and (f) failures of key global players to adopt a cooperative approach to the grand problems of the world. National Outlook: (a) allocative inefficiencies in the money market indicated by the growing interest rate spread and the perverse structure of “market determined” credit allocation; (b) the ever present dangers of asset price bubbles in the capital markets in an era of quantitative easing in the US. EU and Japan; (c) the growing public sector debt stock and its crowding-out effects on private investment and non-debt expenditure; (d) the flow of hot money; (e) the supply and price effects of the widespread flood; (f) the high levels of unemployment and poverty and (g) the state of security. Behavior of players: Global Fund Managers; Deposit Money Banks; Central Banks (EU. US Fed. Bank of Japan. China, etc); Governments (Federal Government; the EU, the US and the New Leaders in China); wholesale and retail players in the money market and capital market operators and regulators. The main challenges for"
Turkiye,2012-11-20,"b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been kept at 5 percent while lending rate has been cut from 9.5 percent to 9 percent. Interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been cut from 9 percent to 8.5 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been cut from 12.5 percent to 12 percent. Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand continues as envisaged. Domestic demand follows a moderate pace, while exports continue to increase despite the weakening global outlook. Overall, aggregate demand conditions support disinflation and current account deficit continues to decline gradually. The Committee expects that year-end inflation will be lower than the forecast presented at the October Inflation Report, owing to the favorable course of unprocessed food prices. However, indirect effects of recent increases in administered and energy prices are closely monitored in terms of medium term inflation outlook. Although recent developments have improved the risk appetite towards Turkish economy, ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy necessitate the monetary policy to remain flexible in both directions. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. The Committee has stated that increasing the reserve option coefficients and narrowing the interest rate corridor by a measured amount would support financial stability. If deemed necessary for financial stability, a measured cut may be considered in the policy rate and the overnight borrowing rate in the forthcoming period. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Georgia,2012-11-21,"21.11.12 NBG Reduces Its Policy Rate by 25 basis points to 5.5% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on November 21, 2012 and decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 5.5 percent. The core and headline inflation were low in October, with the annual inflation reaching 0.1%. Since the previous MPC meeting the inflation forecasts went down. According to the revised forecasts it is expected that the inflation will start moderate growth in the beginning of the next year, although it will remain below its target value throughout the year. The preliminary economic activity indicators point at the weakening of the demand in October, pushing the price level down. Fiscal consolidation will continue in 2013, having a positive influence on price dynamics. During the first half of the year the current account deficit was widening. Trade deficit kept deteriorating in the third quarter as well. The CA deficit widening is aggravated by the decrease in remittances' growth rate, which in turn is significantly influenced by the current economic situation in Europe. Given that the inflation is predicted to remain below the target in the medium term, the National Bank of Georgia decided to reduce the Monetary Policy Rate. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on December 19, 2012."
South Africa,2012-11-22,"Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) the domestic growth outlook has deteriorated, while the upside risks to inflation have increased. Widespread labour market instability and work stoppages have reduced output and export volumes, with the potential for employment losses. Risks to the inflation outlook have been increased by a further depreciation of the rand exchange rate, partly in response to these developments, as well as by a possible higher trend in wage settlements and the impact of the reweighting and rebasing of the CPI basket by Statistics South Africa. At the same time the global environment remains challenging with slowing growth in a number of regions, declining global industrial output, the worsening Japanese outlook, continued uncertainty regarding US fiscal policy and a resurfacing of concerns relating to the resolution of the crisis in the Eurozone, which is now in recession. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas at 5,6 per cent in October 2012, and up from 5,5 per cent in September, was 0,2 percentage points above the market consensus. The categories of food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing and utilities, and transport together accounted for 3,5 percentage points of the inflation outcome. The upside surprise was mainly attributable to food prices which increased by 2,8 per cent month-on-month, and 6,7 per cent on a year-on-year basis. Core inflation, as measured by the exclusion of food, petrol and electricity from CPI, measured 4,7 per cent, unchanged from September. Administered prices excluding petrol increased at a year-on-year rate of 7,5 per cent. Year-on-year producer price inflation moderated further to 4,2 per cent in September, having measured 5,1 per cent in August. This favourable trend was driven mainly by lower rates of increase in the prices of mining products. A marked acceleration was seen in the food-related categories with agricultural prices increasing at a year-on-year rate of 5,2 per cent in September, compared with 4,3 per cent in August and a recent low of 1,7 per cent in May. Manufactured food prices increased by 9,0 per cent and 10,1 per cent in August and September, respectively. The inflation forecast of the Bank reflects a deterioration in the inflation outlook for 2013 compared with the previous forecast. Inflation is now expected to average 5,6 per cent in the final quarter of 2012, and 5,6 per cent for the year. It is expected to average 5,5 per cent in 2013, and 5,0 per cent in 2014 with a peak of 5,7 per cent expected in the first quarter of 2013. This near-term deterioration is mainly due to higher expected food price inflation as well as the recent depreciation of the rand. Core inflation remains contained, indicating the absence of significant demand pressures. This measure is expected to peak at 5,0 per cent in the first quarter of 2013, and to average 4,8 per cent and 4,5 per cent in 2013 and 2014, respectively. These forecasts do not incorporate the new CPI weights and rebasing recently announced by Statistics South Africa as the finer details of these revisions, including the introduction of new products, and the method of linking the old and new baskets, have not yet been finalised. Preliminary evidence suggests that a slight upward bias to the Bank's central projection for headline CPI inflation could occur in 2013. On the assumption that the rate of increase of price changes for most good and services, apart from food and electricity, is more or less unchanged, the combined average upward bias would be relatively small, in the order of around 0,2 percentage points. The new weights and the rebased index will be incorporated formally into the Bank's forecast in 2013 after the revisions have been finalised by Statistics South Africa. Inflation forecasts of financial analysts surveyed by Reuters have also been revised upwards. Financial analysts now expect inflation to average 5,5 per cent in 2013, compared with 5,3 per cent in the previous survey. The expectation for 2014 remains unchanged at 5,4 per cent. It is unclear if these forecasts already take account of the changes to the CPI weights. The break-even inflation rates have also exhibited a moderate upward trend since the previous MPC meeting. The global economic outlook has deteriorated somewhat with a return to recession in the Eurozone. The prospects for the region remain bleak amidst pro-cyclical fiscal austerity, continued household and banking sector deleveraging in a tighter regulatory environment, and renewed concerns relating to the unresolved sovereign debt crisis. The deepening recession has served to heighten the solvency risk of the peripheral countries. The recently announced Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme by the ECB remains yet to be activated. The Japanese economy contracted in the third quarter and leading indicators point to a possible recession. Although the UK economy experienced positive growth in the third quarter, the outlook is negative as the favourable impact from the Olympic Games dissipates. The prognosis for the US economy remains highly dependent on progress in resolving the so-called fiscal cliff. The related uncertainty has already adversely affected investment decisions, and while some last-minute political compromise is likely, the ultimate extent of the fiscal contraction and its impact on growth is still unclear. Failure to resolve this issue could result in a recession and derail the nascent recovery in the housing market. Prospects for emerging markets, while still positive, have also deteriorated somewhat during the past months, contributing to the downside risk to the global recovery. Trend growth rates in Asia are declining, and both China and India are expected to experience weaker growth rates, with possible implications for commodity prices. For some time the exchange rate of the rand has been determined primarily by external developments, particularly changing global risk perceptions. More recently, domestic factors appear to have become dominant determinants of the exchange rate. These include the increased risk posed to the economic outlook by labour market developments in the mining and agricultural sectors in particular; the widening deficit on the current account of the balance of payments, which is likely to have been exacerbated by the stoppages; and the ratings downgrades by two rating agencies while also retaining a negative outlook. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has depreciated by about 6,7 per cent against the US dollar, by 5,8 per cent against the euro, and by 5,8 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. Inflows into the domestic bond market associated with South Africa's inclusion in the World Government Bond Index of Citibank probably helped to moderate the degree of depreciation over this period. Since the beginning of the year, net purchases of South African bonds by non-residents have totaled R85,2 billion. By contrast, non-residents have been net sellers of South African equities since the beginning of the year to the value of R6,8 billion. The rand is expected to remain sensitive to both unfolding domestic economic and political developments, in addition to global risk perceptions. The extent to which the weaker rand feeds into inflation will be dependent on the trading range of the rand going forward and the duration of these moves. Most analysts do not expect further weakening of the rand from current levels, and a number of them expect some recovery. However, the rand is expected to remain volatile and subject to overshooting, and its depreciation poses an increased upside risk to the inflation outlook. The domestic economic growth outlook has deteriorated recently, largely as a result of the continued global slowdown and aggravated by domestic events. Mining output has declined significantly as a result of work stoppages and there are likely to be longer-term implications for output, exports and employment as the mines adjust to higher labour costs. Labour unrest in parts of the agricultural sector is also expected to adversely affect output and prices. Recent high frequency data indicate that third quarter growth was well below the 3,2 per cent recorded in the second quarter. Mining output contracted at a quarter-to-quarter rate of 3,2 per cent in the third quarter and further contractions are expected in the fourth quarter. The physical volume of manufacturing production was adversely affected by the road freight transport sector strike in September when a contraction of 2,3 per cent was recorded on a month-to-month basis. For the quarter as a whole manufacturing output increased by 0,3 per cent. The outlook for the sector remains negative, with the Kagiso PMI declining to a level of 47,1 in October, reflecting an expectation of contraction in the coming months. The Bank's forecast of GDP growth has been revised downward from 2,6 per cent to 2,5 per cent in 2012. Growth in 2013 is now expected to average 2,9 per cent, compared with 3,4 per cent previously, while the growth forecast for 2014 has been revised down from 3,8 per cent to 3,6 per cent. Moreover, the risks to this forecast remain on the downside. The RMB/BER Business Confidence Index declined marginally in the fourth quarter and remains below the 50 index level. Consumption expenditure by households appears to have lost some momentum recently following the 2,9 per cent annualised growth rate in the second quarter. Consumer confidence in the third quarter, as measured by the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index improved marginally, but was still at low levels that were not consistent with robust consumer spending. Nevertheless growth in retail trade sales, which account for about half of household consumption expenditure, has been relatively resilient having grown at a quarter-to-quarter rate of 1,9 per cent in the third quarter. However, passenger vehicle sales and expenditure on services were subdued. There is, however, still little evidence of demand pressures on inflation. The resilience of consumer demand has been attributed to a number of factors, including low interest rates, relatively low inflation, real income growth, high growth rates in unsecured lending, and until recently a relatively strong exchange rate. Some of these factors may be a constraint on expenditure going forward, especially when combined with higher administered price increases which constrain discretionary spending. The MPC is concerned about the recent trend in wage settlements and the potential negative impact on the economy, particularly on growth and investment. These developments could also result in lower growth in employment creation or an absolute decline in employment. Although the reported headline increases granted in some of the settlements are higher than the actual average increases, there is no doubt that the increases granted are well above inflation. This has the potential to increase aggregate demand and prices with a risk of a possible wage-price spiral which could negate the real benefits of these wage increases to workers. However, the impact will be moderated to some extent by the inevitable job losses that are likely to accompany such increases in the context of a slowing economy. The cost push effect of these wage increases will therefore depend on the actual increase in the total wage bill and unit labour cost developments. The most recent wage data, which do not yet incorporate these latest trends, show that in the second quarter of 2012, growth in unit labour costs was 6,1 per cent, while Andrew Levy Employment Publications reported average wage settlement rates in collective bargaining agreements of 7,4 per cent for the first nine months of 2012. Wage settlements at these levels were not assessed to pose a major risk to inflation and these trends will be closely monitored as the collective bargaining landscape has become more fractious. It is also too early to assess the impact of recent developments on employment. According to the Quarterly Labour Force survey, total employment increased by about 200,000 in the third quarter of 2012, but the increased number of unemployed workers resulted in the unemployment rate increasing to 25,5 per cent in September. It is expected however that the positive employment trend in the non-gold mining sector observed during the past year is likely to have reversed or slowed down, while the negative employment trends in manufacturing and gold mining are likely to persist. The net effect of higher wages and lower employment on aggregate expenditure is therefore still unclear at this stage. Credit extension to the private sector moderated on a quarter-to-quarter basis in the third quarter of 2012, when an annualised increase of 5,4 per cent was recorded. Twelve-month growth in total loans and advances to the private sector was 8,8 per cent in September. However, mortgage loan growth remained subdued. When this category is excluded, loans increased at a significant twelve-month rate of 16,6 per cent. The main impetus has come from the persistently strong growth in unsecured lending to households, and this has been related to real income growth particularly in the public sector. Growth in unsecured lending to households remains in excess of 30 per cent but there are some tentative signs that this growth may be moderating. Although to date this has not represented a systemic risk, as it is still a small part of total loans and advances, this is being carefully monitored by the Bank. Unsecured lending has probably helped to underpin household consumption expenditure. The fiscal policy stance, as reflected in the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS), remains supportive of the economy through its contra-cyclical stance. Although the goal of fiscal consolidation is being maintained, the timing has been pushed out further, as lower expected growth is likely to result in lower revenues. Growth in expenditure is projected to remain the same as that set out in the February budget, and no large boost to aggregate demand is expected that could impact on the inflation outlook. Food prices remain a significant risk to the inflation outlook. Global food prices, while still high, have declined from recent peaks. The impact of this shock is still to fully filter through to domestic prices. Although there is usually a lag between the impact of global food price developments on domestic prices, the impact appears to have been felt more quickly than is generally the case. The recent depreciation is also expected to exacerbate the upside risk to food prices. Futures prices, however, indicate that maize prices may be moderating following a better-than-expected domestic harvest. International oil prices have remained relatively unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC, although in the past few days have increased following ongoing hostilities in the Middle East. Domestic petrol prices declined in November despite the depreciation of the rand and, should the exchange rate and international product prices remain at current levels, a further moderate decline can be expected in December. However, international prices remain highly dependent on the global growth outlook and political developments in the Middle East. Since the last MPC meeting the domestic landscape has seen a marked change. While the global crisis remains unresolved. South Africa has seen significant developments that have impacted on the economic outlook and confidence. These domestic developments, if not addressed in a comprehensive and constructive manner, have the potential to derail the progress made to date whereby South Africa has been able to withstand the worst contagion effects of the ongoing global crisis. While recognising that there are real issues that underlie the recent wave of wildcat strikes, the Bank is concerned about the conduct of some of the parties involved in the recent labour market instability and, in particular, the unacceptable levels of violence that have accompanied the strikes. It is critical that both employers and employees take constructive steps to address the fraught relations that appear to be prevalent in a number of areas. Employers need to better appreciate the contribution to stability that an informed, experienced, skilled and organised workforce can make, and also need to be better informed about, and sensitive to, the conditions and circumstances of their employees. An important element of this is to take measures that enable employees to be better informed about the financial situation, strategy and future plans of the companies and sectors that they work in. At the same time employees need to ensure an end to the use of violence in labour relations. In their quest for fair and decent employment conditions, employees need to recognise the potential negative effects of unsustainable cost structures on employment levels and competitiveness in the absence of improved productivity. In the prevailing conditions there is the danger of a wage-price spiral and, inevitably, it will be the workers who bear the brunt of the fall-out. The costs are not only the direct costs in terms of lost production, but also the possible increased costs of finance. In the context of a very weak global economy, where South Africa should strive to be a destination of choice and thereby grow the economy and achieve the pursued developmental and employment goals, the ability to attract investment and improve the country's ratings must be a clear objective. While many of the strikes appear to have been resolved, long term resolution of the underlying causes requires ongoing, concerted action on the part of all the parties involved. We need cohesion and certainty of policy, as well as unity of purpose to build an inclusive, longer-term vision. The National Development Plan is a broad unifying framework that has been adopted by both Cabinet and Parliament, and could form the base to take the country forward, enabling South Africa to play an effective role in the continent as a favoured trading and investment partner. The MPC assesses the balance of risks to the inflation outlook to be on the upside, given the continued pressure of food prices, uncertainty of the exchange rate movements and the reweighting and rebasing of the CPI. Furthermore, the possible impact of higher wage increases could exert further upward pressure on inflation notwithstanding the concerns that recent developments in the labour market could impact negatively on employment. The MPC considers that the demand pressures on inflation at this stage remain relatively benign, as evidenced in the contained trend of underlying inflation. There are also signs of moderation of consumption expenditure against the backdrop of a weak supply side of the economy. The negative output gap is expected to persist for some time, and the balance of risks to the growth outlook remains on the downside. In the light of these factors, the MPC is of the view that the current accommodative stance remains appropriate and has therefore decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,0 per cent per annum. As always, the MPC will monitor developments closely and will not hesitate to act in a manner consistent with its mandate. ADDENDUM TO THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATEMENT OF 22 NOVEMBER 2012."
Hungary,2012-11-27,"At its meeting on 27 November 2012, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 25 basis points from 6.25% to 6.00%, with effect from 28 November 2012. In the Monetary Council's judgement, economic output is likely to fall this year, with growth only expected to resume in 2013. The level of output will be below its potential and unemployment will remain above its long-term level determined by structural factors. Weak demand conditions are expected to persist and the inflation target can be met in 2014 as the temporary inflationary impact of shocks to inflation wanes. The slowdown in CPI inflation in October mainly reflected the fall in fuel prices and the moderation in administered price inflation. The short-term outlook for inflation improved, mostly as a result of favourable developments in non-core inflation items. A sustained reduction in risk premia may lead to an improvement in the medium-term outlook for inflation as well, while the Government's cost-raising measures may point in the opposite direction. The consumer price index remains high, due primarily to rises in food prices as well as the effects of tax increases and other administrative measures. Inflation is likely to remain well above the target this year and next; however, the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand is expected to increasingly dominate inflation developments as the upward pressure from one-off price level shocks subsides. The Council expects the 3 per cent inflation target to be met in 2014. In order to reduce cost pressures on companies and reach a higher level of employment, it is crucial that increases in wages next year, particularly in the minimum wage, are consistent with changes in whole-economy productivity. The Hungarian economy remains in recession and growth is likely to resume next year as the country's export markets recover. Both external and domestic factors point to weak growth over the period ahead. In the Council's judgement, output will remain persistently below its potential level and the labour market will remain loose. The weakness of corporate investment and persistently high unemployment suggest that the economy's potential growth rate is significantly below its pre-crisis level. The measures announced by the Government confirmed its commitment to maintain a low fiscal deficit path. There is considerable uncertainty about the macroeconomic effects of the adjustment measures: the short-term outlook for growth and inflation is likely to be broadly unaffected, but cost pressures may arise in the medium term and the potential growth rate of the economy may fall, reflecting the reduced ability of the banking system to attract capital and restrained lending activity. Higher risks around the agreement with the multinational organisations and the downgrade of Hungary's sovereign debt by S&P may lead to an increase in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy. The Council continues to consider it crucial that an agreement between the Government and the European Union and International Monetary Fund is reached, as this would contribute to a sustained improvement in risk perceptions and a decline in yields as well as to the sustainability of government debt and would help support lending activity and improve the investment climate. The Council judges that there remains a substantial margin of spare capacity in the economy. Therefore, the cost shocks hitting the economy have no adverse effect on the medium-term outlook for inflation, and the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand will dominate as the impact of cost shocks wanes. The favourable global financial market environment, coupled with the Government's strong commitment to maintain a low fiscal deficit, may contribute to a sustained decline in risk premia on domestic financial assets. Expected developments in inflation and financial markets as well as persistently weak demand warrant a lower interest rate level. The Council will consider a further reduction in interest rates if the improvement in financial market sentiment continues and the medium-term outlook for inflation is consistent with the 3 per cent target."
Thailand,2012-11-28,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 28 November 2012 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting today as follows. The global economic outlook showed signs of stabilisation on the back of the better‐ than‐expected economic data especially from the US and China. There was sustained improvement in the US labour and housing markets, although the fiscal cliff remained a key risk factor. China's economy appeared to regain traction with recent strengthening in all key areas including exports, domestic consumption and investment. Meanwhile the eurozone economy contracted, but the economic and financial outlook of the region was projected to be more stable next year as resolution to the euro debt crisis became more concrete and the core economies continued to expand in tandem with improvement in the global economy. Against this backdrop, the outlook of Asian economies has gradually improved with signs of recovery in exports, recent pick‐up in China's economy, as well as buoyant domestic demand. The Thai economy continued its positive growth momentum from the previous meeting. The global impact has so far remained limited only to export‐related sectors, while the greater‐than‐expected strength in domestic demand appeared to provide sufficient cushion against the adverse impact of export slowdown. Going forward, exports were projected to recover in the first half of 2013 on the back of anticipated improvement in the global economy. Private consumption and investment would continue to be the main growth drivers for the economy, supported by strong private sector confidence and accommodative monetary conditions with high credit growth. Inflationary pressure stabilised at a moderate level close to the previous meeting. The MPC viewed that as downside risks to growth subsided with inflationary pressure in check, the current policy rate remained accommodative and conducive to growth. The MPC therefore voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 275 percent per annum. The MPC would remain vigilant in monitoring global and domestic economic developments and stand ready to take appropriate policy action as warranted."
Poland,2012-12-05,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 5 December 2012 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 4-5 December 2012 The Council decided to decrease the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points:  reference rate to 4.25% on an annual basis;  lombard rate to 5.75% on an annual basis;  deposit rate to 2.75% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate to 4.50% on an annual basis. Incoming data show that global economic activity continues to be weak. Although economic growth in the United States accelerated in 2012 Q3, recession in the euro area persisted. At the same time, economic activity in the largest emerging economies was relatively low. Even though weak global economic activity supports inflation decline, the previously observed increase in commodity prices, which continue to be relatively high, has contributed to inflation remaining elevated in many countries. In the recent weeks, risk aversion in the global financial markets has stabilised and commodity prices have increased slightly. A marked economic slowdown in Poland was confirmed by the data on GDP in Q3. A decline in domestic demand deepened, which was driven by decreasing investment and decelerating consumption growth. At the same time, the contribution of change in inventories to GDP growth remained negative. Net exports continued to be the main factor behind GDP growth, which was related to a further decline in imports amidst still positive exports growth. Incoming monthly data, including the persistently slow growth in industrial production and retail sales, as well as a decline in the construction output, indicate that at the beginning of 2012 Q4 activity remained low. Weaker business conditions are accompanied by a deteriorating situation in the labour market. In 2012 Q3, employment growth in the economy, including the corporate sector, slowed down. At the same time, the unemployment rate increased. Slower employment growth and higher unemployment rate contributed to wage growth deceleration. Simultaneously, in the recent months lending to households continued to weaken, including a further decline in the volume of consumer loans. Growth in corporate loans slowed down as well. In October. CPI inflation decreased and amounted to 3.4%, while remaining above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. At the same time, most of the core inflation measures, as well as producer price growth continued to decline, which confirms weakening of demand and cost 00-919 Warszawa, ul.

In the opinion of the Council, incoming data confirm a considerable economic slowdown in Poland, which results in limited wage and inflationary pressures. At the same time, the Council assesses that GDP growth will remain moderate in the coming years, which poses a risk of inflation declining below the NBP's inflation target in the medium term. Therefore, the Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates. The decrease in the interest rates should support economic activity and thus reduces the risk of inflation falling below the target in the medium term. Should the incoming information confirm a protracted economic slowdown, and should the risk of increase in inflationary pressure remain limited, the Council will further ease monetary policy."
Euroarea,2012-12-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Rehn. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Owing to high energy prices and increases in indirect taxes in some euro area countries. HICP inflation rates have been elevated for some time. More recently they have declined, as anticipated, and are expected to fall below 2% in 2013. Over the policy-relevant horizon, inflation rates should remain in line with price stability. The underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The economic weakness in the euro area is expected to extend into next year. In particular, necessary balance sheet adjustments in financial and non-financial sectors and persistent uncertainty will continue to weigh on economic activity. Later in 2013 economic activity should gradually recover, as global demand strengthens and our accommodative monetary policy stance and significantly improved financial market confidence work their way through to the economy. In order to sustain confidence, it is essential for governments to reduce further both fiscal and structural imbalances and to proceed with financial sector restructuring. Today, we have also decided to continue conducting our main refinancing operations (MROs) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the sixth maintenance period of 2013 on 9 July 2013. This procedure will also remain in use for the Eurosystem's special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the second quarter of 2013. The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at the time. The rates in the three-month longer-term refinancing operations, to be allotted until June 2013, will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective longer-term refinancing operation. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following a contraction of 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2012, euro area real GDP declined by 0.1% in the third quarter. Available statistics and survey indicators continue to signal further weakness in activity in the last quarter of the year, although more recently some indicators have stabilised at low levels and financial market confidence has improved further. Over the shorter term, weak activity is expected to extend into next year, reflecting the adverse impact on domestic expenditure of weak consumer and investor sentiment and subdued foreign demand. A gradual recovery should start later in 2013 as our accommodative monetary policy stance and significant improvement in financial market confidence work their way through to private domestic expenditure, and a strengthening of foreign demand should support export growth. This assessment is reflected in the December 2012 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between -0.6% and -0.4% for 2012, between -0.9% and 0.3% for 2013 and between 0.2% and 2.2% for 2014. Compared with the September 2012 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges for 2012 and 2013 have been revised downwards. The Governing Council continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook for the euro area. These are mainly related to uncertainties about the resolution of sovereign debt and governance issues in the euro area, geopolitical issues and fiscal policy decisions in the United States possibly dampening sentiment for longer than currently assumed and delaying further the recovery of private investment, employment and consumption. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation fell to 2.2% in November 2012, down from 2.5% in October and from 2.6% in the two previous months. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are expected to decline further to below 2% next year. Over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of weak economic activity in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain moderate. This assessment is also reflected in the December 2012 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation of 2.5% for 2012, between 1.1% and 2.1% for 2013 and between 0.6% and 2.2% for 2014. Compared with the September 2012 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the projection range for 2013 has been revised downwards. In the Governing Council's assessment, risks to the outlook for price developments are seen as broadly balanced, with downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity and upside risks relating to higher administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher oil prices. Turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued, taking into account developments over several months. Most recently, the annual growth rate of M3 increased to 3.9% in October, from 2.6% in September, while M1 growth accelerated to 6.4% from 5.0% over the same period. These developments are partly due to a specific transaction leading to an increase in overnight deposits belonging to the non-monetary financial sector. At the same time, deposits from households and non-financial corporations also rose in October. Overall, more observations are needed to distinguish between shorter-term volatility and more lasting factors. Unlike in the case of monetary developments, there has been little change in credit growth. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained at -0.4% in October, unchanged from September. But this development reflects further net redemptions in loans to non-financial corporations, which led to an annual rate of decline in these loans of -1.5%, down from -1.2% in September. The annual growth in MFI lending to households remained unchanged at 0.8% in October. To a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the weak outlook for GDP, heightened risk aversion and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises, all of which weigh on credit demand. Furthermore, in a number of euro area countries, capital constraints, risk perception and the segmentation of financial markets restrict credit supply. In order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential to continue strengthening the resilience of banks where needed. The soundness of banks' balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels. Decisive steps for establishing an integrated financial framework will help to accomplish this objective. A single supervisory mechanism (SSM) is one of the main building blocks. It is a crucial move towards re-integrating the banking system. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. Further economic policy measures and progress in the reform of European governance should help to support financial market sentiment and improve the outlook for economic growth. In this context, the Governing Council looks forward to the roadmap towards genuine Economic and Monetary Union to be decided at the European Council meeting on 13-14 December 2012. Initiatives to accelerate structural reforms that help restore competitiveness are particularly important to revive the growth potential of euro area countries and to increase employment. More generally, all euro area countries must ensure that their product and labour markets possess the adjustment capacity required for their smooth and effective functioning within a monetary union. Finally, continued fiscal consolidation is expected to restore sound fiscal positions, in line with the commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact and the 2012 European Semester recommendations. Significant progress has already been made in reducing domestic and external imbalances and in improving competitiveness. Continued policy actions on the European, structural and fiscal reform fronts should be mutually reinforcing and send a strong signal to markets."
Egypt,2012-12-06,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release December 6, 2012 In its meeting held on December 6, 2012, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 925 percent and 1025 percent, respectively, and the 7‐day repo at 975 percen. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 95 percen. Headline CPI increased by 079 percent (m/m) in October following 12 percent (m/m) in September, bringing the annual rate to 670 percent from 622 percent in the previous mont. The latest monthly development in headline inflation was largely driven by the sharp rise in the prices of butane gas cylinders on the back of bottlenecks in the distribution channels in addition to the annual adjustment in school tuition fee. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 118 percent (m/m) in October following a decline of 031 percent (m/m) in September on the back of sporadic increases in food prices as well as moderate inch ups in some non‐food price. While the probability of a rebound in international food prices is less likely now in light of recent global developments, the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels pose upside risks to the inflation outloo. Meanwhile real GDP grew by 26 percent in 2012/2013 Q1, following a similarly feeble growth rate of 22 percent in 2011/201. This nascent recovery in economic ac(cid::415)vity came on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction secto. Nonetheless GDP growth remains to be partly suppressed by continuing weaknesses, albeit of lesser extent, in the manufacturing and tourism sector. In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market par(cid::415)cipants since early 2011, investment levels remained lo. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Are. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. Given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks and the uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat Sub Governor.

Russia,2012-12-10,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 10 December 2012 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to raise effective from 11 December 2012 the interest rates on the fixed-term deposit operations by 0.25 percentage points, reduce the interest rate on the rouble leg of the Bank of Russia FX swap transactions by 0.25 percentage points and maintain the refinancing rate and the interest rates on the other Bank of Russia operations unchanged (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects. Narrowing the spread between the interest rates on certain Bank of Russia liquidity providing and absorbing operations is neutral from the viewpoint of the current monetary policy stance. It should contribute to restraining money market rates volatility and strengthening of the interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In November the pace of inflation was unchanged at 6.5% over a year ago. Core inflation remained at 5.8%. In the recent months stabilization was observed in a wide range of consumer goods and services prices, while the growth of nonfood goods prices decelerated. Still, the pace of inflation remains above the target range, which may affect economic agents' expectations and thus poses inflation risks. On the other hand, the September 2012 increase in the Bank of Russia interest rates is to some extent curbing inflation expectations. Moreover, any significant demand-pull price pressures are absent. In the third quarter the pace of GDP growth declined to 2.9% over a year ago, reflecting some cooling in economic activity. The dynamics of the key macroeconomic indicators in October pointed to continuation of this trend with the growth of industrial production and retail sales subsiding. However, economic confidence indicators remain positive and labour market conditions together with credit expansion provide support to the domestic demand. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, the gross output remains close to its potential level. The pace of bank lending growth is leveling off but remains relatively high, implying that the risks of a significant economic slowdown stemming from the tighter monetary conditions are minor. Considering recent domestic and international macroeconomic developments the Bank of Russia judges that the current level of money market interest rates is appropriate for the near future. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks, including global food price dynamics, global economic developments and the consequences of the monetary conditions tightening for the Russian economy. In making monetary policy decisions the Bank of Russia will be guided by medium-term inflation goals and economic growth prospects, as well as the dynamics of inflation expectations. The next meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the first half of January 2013.

Philippines,2012-12-12,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 3.50 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and5.50 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also maintained accordingly. The reserve requirement ratios were kept steady as well. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that current monetary settings remain appropriate, as the cumulative 100-basis-point reduction in policy rates in 2012 continues to work its way through the economy. The latest baseline forecasts follow a slightly lower path but remained within the lower bound of the target over the policy horizon. Risks to the inflation outlook appear to be evenly balanced around the baseline forecasts, with inflation expectations broadly aligned with the inflation target range. Moreover, global economic activity has stabilized in recent months, although fiscal consolidation and financial market stresses in advanced economies continue to temper overall market sentiment. Global economic prospects, therefore, are likely to stay subdued, thus mitigating upward pressures on commodity prices. At the same time, the Monetary Board observed that the domestic economy has gained pace on the back of strong domestic demand and buoyant business sentiment. The growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) was stronger than expected at 7.1 percent in Q3 2012, driven by private spending and fiscal stimulus. In the months ahead, adequate liquidity and strong bank lending are expected to continue to support domestic economic activity and sustain the economy's momentum. On balance, therefore, the Monetary Board is of the view that the manageable inflation outlook and robust domestic growth support keeping policy settings steady. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor evolving price and output conditions to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with ensuring stable prices while supporting economic growth."
United States,2012-12-12,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity and employment have continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months, apart from weather-related disruptions. Although the unemployment rate has declined somewhat since the summer, it remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, and the housing sector has shown further signs of improvement, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed. Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month. The Committee also will purchase longer-term Treasury securities after its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of Treasury securities is completed at the end of the year, initially at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and, in January, will resume rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. The Committee views these thresholds as consistent with its earlier date-based guidance. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Dennis P Lockhart; Sandra Pianalto; Jerome H Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Jeremy C Stein; Daniel K Tarullo; John C Williams; and Janet L Yellen.

Chile,2012-12-13,"Central Bank of Chile Press Release* Santiago, 13 December 2012 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). Internationally, risks associated to the fiscal and financial situation in the Eurozone are still high, while the risk of a sharp fiscal adjustment in the United States is still present. Global financial conditions are somewhat more favorable than a month ago, and the dollar has depreciated in international markets, at a time when the Federal Reserve has announced new monetary stimulus measures. Incoming information confirms weak growth in developed economies, while more positive signs are observed in some emerging economies. The copper price has experienced a rebound, while fuel prices have receded. Domestically, output and demand indicators evolved above projections during the third quarter. The labor market remains tight. The negative CPI variation of November obeyed to one-time factors. Y-o-y core inflation remains around 2%. Inflation expectations over the policy horizon remain aligned with the target. The peso has appreciated with respect to the dollar. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2012-12-13,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the moderate economic recovery in the US to have continued, but the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have persisted. Economic indicators in emerging market countries have shown signs of gradual improvement. The Committee expects the global economy to exhibit a modest recovery going forward but judges the downside risks to growth to be large, owing chiefly to the euro area fiscal crisis and to the fiscal consolidation issue in the US. In Korea, the Committee appraises economic growth to have remained at a weak level, with exports improving but the sluggishness in domestic demand continuing. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has shown a trend of increase above its average pre-global financial crisis level, led by the higher age groups. Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will persist for a considerable time, due mostly to the prolongation of the euro area fiscal crisis and to the delay in recovery of world economic growth. Consumer price inflation fell to 1.6% in November, from 2.1% the previous month, a result mainly of declines in agricultural and petroleum product prices, and core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products continued to run at a low level at 1.3%. The Committee forecasts that inflation will remain low for 1 the time being, owing primarily to the easing of demand-side pressures. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas continued their downtrend and those in the rest of the country their uptrend. In the financial markets, stock prices and long-term market interest rates rose, due mostly to international financial market stability and improvements in economic indicators in major countries, and the Korean won appreciated against the US dollar owing chiefly to the continued surplus in the current account. Looking ahead, the Committee will closely monitor external risk factors and the consequent changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and conduct monetary policy so as to stabilize consumer price inflation at the inflation target over a medium-term horizon while continuing its efforts to lower inflation expectations and ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded."
Russia,2012-12-13,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 13 September 2012 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to raise the refinancing rate and the interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations by 0.25 percentage points effective from 14 September 2012 (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was made in view of prices and inflation expectations growth, which increases the risks of exceeding the medium-term inflation targets of the Bank of Russia, and also taking into account the economic growth prospects. In August and in the beginning of September inflation continued to increase and as of 10 of September the pace of inflation was estimated at 6.3% over a year ago, which exceeds the target range for 2012. Higher pace of inflation was mainly attributed to the accelerated growth of the food prices and the further increase in regulated prices and tariffs. The observed worsening of the food market conditions in Russia and globally combined with this year's crop harvest estimates remains the important source of inflation risks, particularly taking into account the impact of the above mentioned factors on inflation expectations. During the past few months core inflation gradually accelerated and reached 5.5% in August, which indicates that influence of monetary factors on inflationary processes increases. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, gross output remains close to its potential level. In July the growth of investment in production capacity continued to decelerate and retail sales growth rate decreased. However the growth of industrial production recovers and producer confidence indicators remain fairly strong. Labour market conditions together with credit growth, the pace of which remains high despite some signs of stabilization, support robust domestic demand. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks, the global economic developments and the consequences of the monetary conditions tightening for the Russian economy. In making monetary policy decisions the Bank of Russia will rely on medium-term inflation goals and economic growth prospects, as well as the dynamics of inflation expectations.

Pakistan,2012-12-14,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 14th December 2012 The changes in fundamental variables influencing the recent monetary policy decisions of SBP continue to support the current stance. The credit extended to private businesses remains muted. The deceleration in CPI inflation is faster than the projected path. And the external current account deficit in October 2012 is small. The overall stress in the external position, however, is increasing given the declining financial inflows and substantial debt repayments. Assigning appropriate weights to these competing considerations is the main challenge currently faced by monetary policy. Led by direct and portfolio investment flows, the total net capital and financial account inflows are on declining path for some years now. For instance, these inflows have come down from peak of. percent of GDP in FY07 to. percent of GDP in FY12. This trend is continuing in FY13. During the first four months, there has been net outflow of $304 million from the capital and financial account. This together with substantial debt repayments to the IMF, has resulted in decline in foreign exchange reserves of SBP from $10. billion at end-June 2012 to $8. billion as on 14 December 2012. Thus despite an external current account surplus of $258 million during July-October. FY13, there has been some pressure on the rupee to depreciate. Since the beginning of FY13, the rupee, viz-a-viz dollar, has depreciated by. percent. This stressed external position has implications for the rest of the economy. For instance, the decline in foreign exchange reserves is causing contraction in rupee liquidity. depreciating currency is also affecting the size of the outstanding external debt in rupee terms and thus has implications for the fiscal position. Moreover the magnitude and speed of pass through of exchange rate changes to CPI inflation need to be monitored closely in these circumstances. Both the level of interest rate set by the SBP and the timely realization of budgeted foreign inflows are critical in managing the balance of payment position. The lower interest rate can potentially affect the credit demand, including that of imports, and return on rupee denominated assets relative to foreign currency assets. The first consideration is not source of concern at the moment given the weak overall credit conditions and consistent decline in the quantum of imports. The second consideration is important and puts natural limit on downward adjustments in the interest rate. However it needs to be weighed against the expected budgeted foreign inflows, which are not linked with the interest rate but can boost much needed financial inflows. The timely realization of these official inflows is of essence and can alleviate the fiscal pressure on domestic borrowings to some extent. Showing year-on-year growth of 26. percent, these fiscal borrowings from the banking system continue to remain the main source of monetary expansion. During July 30 November. FY13, the fiscal authority has borrowed Rs586 billion from the scheduled banks and has retired Rs106 billion to the SBP. Consequently, the level of outstanding liquidity injections by the SBP, at Rs615 billion as on 14 December 2012, remains high. The size of these injections would not be source of concern as long as inflation stays low and stable. However given the current high Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN year-on-year growth in broad money of 17. percent, this approach would require more vigilance in the near future. It is worth highlighting that almost all of the fiscal borrowings from the scheduled banks and the retirement to the SBP took place during Q1-FY13. In Q2-FY13, the fiscal authority has mostly relied on the SBP to meet its financing requirements while just rolling over the maturing scheduled bank debt. As per the recent amendments in the SBP Act, the fiscal authority is required to ensure at least zero borrowings from the SBP during quarter. Given that only two weeks remain before the end of Q2- FY13, it seems unlikely that this requirement would be met. sustainable reduction in fiscal borrowings from the banking system and thus the scaling down of liquidity injections by the SBP and monetary growth is not possible without comprehensive fiscal reforms. The fiscal deficit of Rs284 billion or. percent of GDP during Q1-FY13 was entirely financed by borrowings from the domestic sources. Given that almost 91 percent of last year's fiscal deficit was also financed from domestic sources, year-on-year growth of 62. percent in interest payments on domestic debt in Q1-FY13 is not surprising. Thus without improving the tax collection capability, and given an increasing proportion of expenditures belonging to interest payments, the task of containing the size of the fiscal deficit and thus borrowing requirements would become more and more difficult. The state of credit to private businesses is not encouraging despite cumulative 400 basis point reduction in the policy rate over the last 16 months. The detailed disaggregated data show contraction of Rs39. billion in this head during the first four months of FY13, with most of the contraction taking place in the manufacturing sector. While there is some seasonal pick up since mid-October onwards, the outlook for the year is not encouraging. The reason, as highlighted by the SBP earlier as well, is that the expected support to the SBP's initiative in the shape of improvement in the availability of energy and reduction in fiscal borrowing needs has not come through yet. Thus both the demand for and supply of credit to the private sector remain sub-optimal. The consistently low level of credit availed by the private sector together with declining foreign investments are the main factors responsible for stagnant economy. The persistent energy shortages have already decreased the utilization of productive capacity of the economy. Resultantly the output gap the difference between aggregate demand and the ability of the economy to meet this demand is now almost negligible. At the same time, availability of food supplies has been better this year compared to last two years. sharply decelerating CPI inflation is reflection of these conditions. The decline in CPI inflation is considerably faster than earlier estimates. The year-on-year CPI inflation for November 2012 stands at. percent, with food inflation dropping to. percent and non-food inflation coming down to. percent. Even the core inflation measures are in single digits. This broad based deceleration in inflation is now expected to keep the average inflation for FY13 below the. percent target for the year. Therefore the Central Board of Directors of SBP has decided to reduce the policy rate by 50 basis points to. percent with effect from 17 December 2012. Page of."
Peru,2012-12-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR DECEMBER 2012 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based on the fact that inflation continues to decline and that it has returned to the target range after the shocks on the side of supply partially reversed in a domestic context characterized by an economic pace of growth close to the economy's potential growth and in an external context still characterized by high uncertainty. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider future adjustments in monetary policy instruments. Inflation in November showed a monthly rate of -0.14 percent, a similar rate to the one registered in September (-0.16 percent, which reflected the reversal of the prices of perishable food products. With this result, inflation in the last 12 months fell from 3.25 percent in October to 2.66 percent in November. Core inflation showed a rate of 0.20 percent and thus accumulates a rate of 3.23 percent in the last 12 months, a lower rate than in the previous month. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a monthly rate of 0.07 percent and an annual rate of 1.92 percent. Supply conditions for perishable food products continued improving in November, which contributed to the reversal of the supply shocks that had been affecting inflation transitorily. As a result of this, inflation returned to the target range. This trend is expected to continue in 2013 with inflation gradually converging towards the 2 percent target. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show that the growth of the Peruvian economy has stabilized around its long-term sustainable level of growth, although the indicators associated with the external market still register a weak performance. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent.

India,2012-12-18,"Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: December 2012 Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of the current macroeconomic assessment, it has been decided to: keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.25 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities; and keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) and the Bank Rate at 9.0 per cent. Introduction 2. Since the Second Quarter Review (SQR) of October 2012, the global economy has shown some signs of stabilisation although the situation remains fragile. While activity is picking up in the US and the UK, near-term prospects in the euro area are still weak. Moreover, there is no clarity as yet on how the US ‘fiscal cliff' might be managed. While several emerging and developing economies (EDEs) are gradually returning to higher growth, weak external demand and contagion risks from advanced economies (AEs) render them vulnerable to further shocks. On the domestic front, there are some incipient signs of pick-up though growth remains significantly below its recent trend. Also, though consumer price inflation remains stubborn, the pace of moderation in wholesale price inflation has been faster than anticipated. With food and manufacturing prices expected to edge down further, inflationary pressures may ease somewhat in the coming months. Global Economy 4. Since the SQR, global activity has remained sluggish, but country growth trajectories appear to be de-coupling. In the US, the revised GDP estimates for Q3 of 2012 indicate that a pick-up in growth is underway, supported by rising non-farm payroll employment, home sales and house prices. In order to support a stronger recovery, the Fed continued its quantitative easing, and announced further expansion through purchase of longer-term treasury securities. In contrast, euro area growth contracted for a second successive quarter in Q3, and retail sales have been declining at a faster pace in Q4. In Japan. GDP growth contracted in Q3, triggering a2 fresh dose of fiscal stimulus. Overall, the global purchasing managers' index (PMI) for November points to acceleration, with the all-industry index recording an eight- month high. International energy and non-energy commodity prices softened in November for the second month in a row, suggesting lower inflationary pressures. Domestic Economy Growth 5. GDP growth in Q2 of 2012-13 at 5.3 per cent was marginally lower than 5.5 per cent in Q1. However, there are some indications of a modest firming up of activity in Q3. Industrial activity rose sharply in October but this is, in large part, due to a low base and festival-related demand which propelled the growth of both consumer durables and non-durables into double digits. Significantly, capital goods production recorded a growth of 7.5 per cent after 13 successive months of decline. The manufacturing PMI rose moderately in November as order book volumes expanded. While the services PMI declined from a month ago, expansion in new business and order book volumes suggests positive sentiment about increasing activity in the months ahead. In the farm sector, rabi sowing coverage is expanding steadily, improving the prospects of agricultural growth. Inflation 6. Headline WPI inflation edged down to 7.2 per cent in November, mainly owing to softening of prices of vegetables, minerals and fuel. On the other hand, prices of cereals and protein-based items such as eggs, fish and meat firmed up further. Significantly, core (non-food manufactured products) inflation eased, aided by decline in prices of metals, cement and chemicals. The seasonally adjusted three- month moving average annualised momentum indicator also points to ebbing of inflationary pressures. However, in striking contrast to wholesale inflation developments, retail inflation remained elevated. The new combined (rural and urban) CPI (Base:2010=100) inflation increased in November, reflecting sustained food inflation pressures, particularly in respect of vegetables, cereals, pulses, oils and fats. The non-food component of the index also suggested persistent inflationary pressures. Monetary and Liquidity Conditions 7. While money supply (M ) growth remained below its indicative trajectory 3 because of lower deposit growth, non-food credit growth rose above the indicative trajectory of 16 per cent suggesting some pick-up in economic activity. Liquidity conditions have remained tight in Q3 due to large government balances with the Reserve Bank and the widening wedge between deposit and credit growth. With a view to containing the liquidity deficit at reasonable levels, the Reserve Bank conducted open market operations (OMOs) on December 4 and 11, injecting primary liquidity of 232 billion. Accordingly, money market rates remained close to the repo rate. External Sector 8. With the step-up in oil imports persisting despite the moderation in crude prices, the cumulative trade deficit for April-November widened from its level a year ago indicating significant risks to the balance of payments from the adverse external environment. Even as capital inflows improved compared to Q2, there were downward pressures on the rupee reflecting the large trade and current account deficits.3 Outlook 9. Lead indicators point to a modest firming up in the momentum of global growth over the rest of 2012 and in 2013 if there is firm policy action in the euro area and the US. The biggest risk to the outlook stems from political economy considerations that could impede, delay or erode resolute policy action. The consequences could be deepened financial stress and heightened risk aversion. For EDEs, the threat of spillovers remains significant in view of the depressed outlook for global trade and volatile capital flows. Although inflation pressures appear to be moderating, elevated food and commodity prices remain contingent risks, especially for EDEs facing domestic supply constraints. On the domestic front. GDP growth is evolving along the baseline projection of 5.8 per cent for 2012-13 set out in the SQR. The recent policy initiatives by the Government and further reforms should help to boost business sentiment and improve the investment climate. As regards inflation, excess capacity in some sectors is working towards moderating core inflation. Furthermore, the easing of international commodity prices, particularly of crude, is expected to impart some softening bias to the evolving inflation conditions if it is not offset by the impact of rupee depreciation. The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring the evolving growth- inflation dynamic and will update the formal numerical assessment of its growth and inflation projections for 2012-13 as part of the third quarter review in January 2013. Guidance 11. Headline inflation has been below the Reserve Bank's projected levels over the past two months. The decline in core inflation has also been comforting. These emerging patterns reinforce the likelihood of steady moderation in inflation going into 2013-14, though inflation may edge higher over the next two months. In view of inflation pressures ebbing, monetary policy has to increasingly shift focus and respond to the threats to growth from this point onwards. Liquidity conditions will be managed with a view to supporting growth as stated in the SQR, thereby preparing the ground for further shifting the policy stance to support growth. Overall, recent inflation patterns and projections provide a basis for reinforcing our October guidance about policy easing in the fourth quarter. However, risks to inflation remain and accordingly, even as the policy emphasis shifts towards growth, the policy stance will remain sensitive to these risks.

Turkiye,2012-12-18,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to adjust the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been cut from 5.75 percent to 5.5 percent. b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been kept at 5 percent while lending rate has been kept at 9 percent. Interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been kept at 8.5 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been kept at 12 percent. Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand continues as envisaged. Domestic demand follows a moderate pace while exports continue to increase despite weakening global activity. Overall, aggregate demand conditions support disinflation and current account deficit continues to decline gradually. Confidence indices and credit growth show a marked increase, supported by the accommodative liquidity policies implemented by the Central Bank since mid-year and the relative improvement in the risk appetite. Therefore, the contribution of domestic demand to economic growth is expected to increase in the forthcoming period. The Committee expects that year-end inflation will be significantly lower than the forecast presented in the October Inflation Report, owing to the favorable course of unprocessed food prices. However, indirect effects of recent increases in administered and energy prices are closely monitored in terms of the medium term inflation outlook. The Committee has stated that, in order to contain the risks on financial stability in the face of accelerating capital inflows, the proper policy would be to keep interest rates at low levels while continuing with macroprudential measures. Accordingly, the Committee has indicated that, in order to support financial stability, it would be appropriate to take additional steps using reserve requirements, while delivering a limited cut in the policy rate. In the following period, if deemed necessary for financial stability, a measured adjustment in the interest rate corridor might also be considered. Ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy necessitate the monetary policy to remain flexible in both directions. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Czech Republic,2012-12-19,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 8th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 19 December 2012 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.05%. Reasons for the decision Next year, headline inflation will be slightly above the CNB's inflation target owing to tax changes, whereas monetary-policy relevant inflation will be in the lower half of the tolerance band over the whole forecast horizon including the monetary policy horizon. Consistent with the forecast is a decline in market interest rates, followed by a rise in rates in 2014. The overall risks to the inflation forecast are slightly on the downside. Developments in industrial production, construction output and retail sales in October continue to indicate subdued economic activity. The labour market exhibits signs of slump: Total employment saw y-o-y growth in 2012 Q3, but it declined when converted to full- time employment. Unemployment continued to rise in terms of both the s.a. general unemployment rate in Q3 and the s.a. registered unemployment rate in October and November. Y-o-y growth in the average nominal wage again decelerated markedly in 2012 Q3. The inflationary effects of external cost-push factors weakened somewhat due to slightly lower oil prices.

Georgia,2012-12-19,"19.12.12 NBG Reduces Its Policy Rate by 25 basis points to 5.25% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on December 19, 2012 and decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent. Both annual and core inflation were low in November, with the annual CPI inflation reaching -0.5%, mostly due to the decline in food prices and appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate in the first half of the year. According to current information the inflation forecast for the coming 6-8 quarters went even lower since the last MPC meeting. According to existing forecast the annual inflation during the coming year is expected to remain below the target (6%). The preliminary economic activity indicators point at the weakening of the demand in November, pushing the price level down. Despite high levels of liquidity and capital in the banking sector, credit activity is still modest, due to low demand for loans. Another factor causing weakening of the demand is the low growth rate of foreign remittances, significantly affected by the current economic situation in Europe. On the other hand, stable growth of tourism income stimulates demand growth. The prices for the main commodities on world markets are stable. Due to the global crisis, the inflation and growth rates in the main trading partners of Georgia are declining. This is an additional factor pushing the price level in Georgia downwards. Given that the inflation will remain below the target in the medium term, the National Bank of Georgia decided to continue monetary softening and to reduce the Monetary Policy Rate. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on February 13, 2012."
Thailand,2012-12-20,"Outcome of the Joint Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 20 December 2012 The Bank of Thailand announced the outcome of the second joint meeting of MPC and FIPC for 2012 as follows. On Economic Conditions, the Committees viewed that key risks to economic and financial stability continued to stem from the global economic outlook, the US fiscal cliff, the prolonged economic problem in Europe, as well as the policy direction of the newly elected Japanese government. All this may lead to uncertainty in the global financial markets and increased capital flow volatility in the periods ahead, thus warranting continued close monitoring. On Financial Stability, two issues were discussed : 21 The Committees assessed financial stability of the Thai financial system and deemed that vigilant monitoring of credit conditions and growth of household debt is warranted. Recent data indicated that the consumer loan quality remained sound despite its continued high growth. Hence although overall financial stability was not affected, there were signs that debt serviceability of some borrowers, especially the low-income group, could deteriorate. .2 The Committees discussed the increasing role of Specialized Financial Institutions (SFIs) which could have greater implications for overall financial stability. The Committees acknowledged coordination between the Bank of Thailand and the Ministry of Finance in reforming the role of SFIs. On Financial Institutions Regulation and Supervision, the Committees viewed that the Thai banking system is strong and well-placed to comply with the Basel III capital standard and that other on-going regulatory reforms in the US. UK and Europe should not have significant direct impact on the Thai banking system. Bank of Thailand 20 December 2012."
Israel,2012-12-24,"The development of actual prices, inflation expectations for the year ahead, and recent months' surprises to the downside in the CPI indicate a continued decline in the inflation environment, and apparently weaknessin domestic demand as well. Inflation over the previous 12 months was below the midpoint of the target range, and inflation expectations for the yearahead are near the midpoint of the target range. Commodity prices in general, and oil prices in particular, declined slightly this month; these are expected to have an impact on domestic prices in the future. Home prices continued to increase in September-October. However, it is too early to assess the impact on home prices of the LTV ratiolimitations which were imposed by the Supervisor of Banks and went into effect at the beginning of November. To view this press release as a Word file. Againstthe background of the need to provide additional support for economic activity and the absence of inflationary pressures at this time, the Monetary Committee decided to reduce the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and globaleconomies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing high level of uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on January 7, 2013. The decision regarding the interest rate for February 2013 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. January 28, 2013. Currency (Unit) Rate Daily Change. Nominal Effective Rate 0.020%. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for November declined by 0.5 percent. Forecasts projected a decline of 0.1 percent, on average. This is the third consecutive month in which the CPI has surprised to the downside. The development of actual prices indicates continued moderation of the inflation environment. The rate of inflation over the previous twelve months was 1.4 percent, compared with a figure of 1.8 percent last month. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Forecasts of the inflation rate over the next twelve months based on the average of forecasters' inflation predictions, and on inflation expectations based on over-the-counter CPI futurescontracts offered by banks, declined slightly during the month, and are currently about 1.8 percent. Expectations calculated from the capital markets (break-even inflation) declined as well this month, to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.7 percent, or 2.2 percent without seasonal adjustment. Inflation expectations for two years and longer were stable and remained at around 2.3-2.6 percent. Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rateone year from now derived from the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market as well as expectations based on the average projection of forecasters are for an interest rate of 1.8 percent. The forecasters who provide projections to the Bank of Israel predict that the Bank will reduce the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points during the first quarter. ; Real economic activity: Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month point to a continuation of the slowdown in activity, and the GDP growth rate in the fourth quarter is expected to be lower than the previous quarter. The slowdown can be seen in the Composite State-of-the-Economy Index. The index increased by 0.1 percent in November, and its low rate of growth in recent months reflects a decline in manufacturing production and a slowdown in goods exports. The results of various surveys of activity also indicate continued slowdown. The source of the weakness in activityis apparently related to a slowdown in exports due to weakness in global markets, a slowdown in world trade, and the effects of Operation Pillar of Defense. Some of the indicators pointing to a moderation in activity (primarily foreign trade data) were negatively impacted in November by OperationPillar of Defense, which is mostly a temporary effect. During the fighting, about 5 percent of the workforce was absent. During the operation therewas a sharp decline in tourist entries into Israel, and past experience has shown that this effect will likely continue several months after the operation ended, as well. As a result of the operation, the economy lost about 0.3 percent of GDP during the fourth quarter (in quarterly terms). ; ; The labor market: Labor force survey data which became available this month indicate that the unemployment rate in the economy increased slightly in October, to 7 percent, with a decline of 0.3 percentage points in the participation rate, to 63.8 percent. With that, if the figures for ages 25-64 are examined (that is, the age range affected less by changes in the survey's methodology earlier this year), it can be seen that there was a slight decline in the unemployment rate in October, with a decline in the rates of participation and employment. In September, the number of employee posts continued to decline in the business sector, and continued to increase in the public sector. The Business Tendency Survey indicates an expected slowdown in the increase of the number of employees in the coming 3 months. Nominal wages increased by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, compared with the previous quarter, and real wages increased by 0.4 percent, based on seasonally adjusted figures. Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of nominal wage payments, were 4.8 percent higher in October-November than in the corresponding period of the previous year, compared with a year over year increase of 5.8 percent in September-October. ; The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: This month, the Bankof Israel Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast. In the Research Department's assessment, the inflation rate is expected to be 1.8 percent in 2013. The Bank of Israel interest rate, which was 2 percent when the forecast was being compiled, was expected to decline in the near term to 1.75 percent, and to then remain unchanged until at least the end of 2013. The GDP growth rate in 2012 is estimated to be 3.3 percent. The growth rate for 2013 is projected to be 3.8 percent, assuming that production of natural gas from the Tamar field begins during the second quarter of 2013, as planned, and reflects the methodology used by the Central Bureau of Statistics regarding the recording of the gas output (and replacement of fuel imports) in the National Accounts. Excluding the production of natural gas fromthe Tamar field. GDP is expected to increase in 2013 by 2.8 percent, compared with a projection of 3.0 percent in the previous quarter's forecast. Itshould be noted that gas production requires only very small inputs of labor, and that accordingly the expected development of employment and unemployment is determined largely by the growth rate of GDP excluding (rather than including) gas production. ; Budget data: The deficit in domestic government activity totaled about NIS 21.2 billion in January-November, some NIS 8.7 billion greater than the seasonal path consistent with the Ministry of Finance's deficit forecast at the beginning of 2012 (3.4 percent of GDP). Based on developments to date, the deficit for the full year is projected to reach about 4-4.2 percent of GDP, assuming that government expenditure does not surpass theoriginal amount in the budget. The accumulated deviation from the seasonalpath consistent with the Ministry of Finance's original projection resultsfrom revenues some NIS 7.2 billion below the path, and expenditure which is about NIS 1.5 billion above the path. ; The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on November 25, 2012, through December 21, 2012, the shekel strengthened against the dollar by about 3 percent, an appreciation which was especially notable compared with that of most major currencies against the dollar. The shekel's strength occurred primarily against the background of a renewed trend of shekel purchases by nonresidents since the endof Operation Pillar of Defense. The shekel appreciated by 1.5 percent against the euro, while most major currencies weakened against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel appreciated by about 2 percent during the period since November 25. ; The capital and money markets: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on November 25, 2012, through December 21, 2012, the Tel Aviv 25 Indexincreased by about 0.8 percent. Yields declined by about 10 basis points on unindexed government bonds, on average, and declined by about 15 basis points on CPI-indexed government bonds. This trend of declining yields on government bonds was in contrast to the global trend, and occurred, among other things, against the background of the Ministry of Finance's notice of reduced issuance volume in the coming quarter. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities declined by 25 basis points, to 220 basis points. Makam yields also declined along most of the curve, with one-year yields declining to 1.8 percent during the period. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread declined slightly during the intermeeting period to 135 basis points. The Tel-Bond 60 Index remained unchanged, but spreads in the corporate bond market declined further, encompassing all ratings and industries. ; The money supply: In the twelve months ending in November, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 7.1 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 7.6 percent. ; Developments in the credit markets: The outstanding debt of the business sector increased by 0.7 percent in October, from NIS 783 billion to NIS 788 billion; in the past 12 months the debt has increased by 3.5 percent. Total outstanding credit to households increased in October by 0.6 percent, to NIS 386 billion. The total volume of new mortgages granted in November was NIS 4.1 billion, compared with NIS 3.4 billion in October. The balance of housing debt was NIS 275 billion at the end of October, an increase of 7.5 percent since October 2011. Interest rates on new CPI-indexed mortgages grantedin November remained essentially unchanged, and declined in the unindexed,floating-rate track following the reduction of the Bank of Israel interest rate in November. About two months ago, directives from the Supervisor of Banks went into effect, limiting the loan-to-value ratio in new housing loans, but it is still too early to estimate their effect on the housing market, as these directives exclude, until the end of the year, loans which wereapproved in principle before the directives came into effect. ; The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (representing rents) declined by 0.2 percent in November. In the twelve months ending in November,it increased by 2.8 percent, compared with an increase of 2.2 percent in the twelve months to October. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased in September-October by 0.5 percent, after increasing by 0.6 percent in August-September. In the twelve months ending in October, home prices increased by 3.7 percent, compared with an increase of 2.3 percent in the twelve months to September. ; The number of building starts over the previous 12 months remains high (38,650 in the 12 months ending in September, compared with 40,097 in the 12 months which ended in August), and it is expected to continue to be reflected in an increased stock of homes. With that, in the third quarter there was a sharp decline in the level of building starts, and the rate of properties marketed by the Israel Land Administration has decreased significantly. ; The global economy: ; The main considerations behind the decision The decision to reduce the interest rate for January 2013 by 0.25 percentage points, to 1.75 percent, is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest ratepolicy which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel, the global economy, monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. </div> The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: The development of actual prices, inflation expectations for the year ahead, and recent months' surprises to the downside in the CPI indicate a continued decline in the inflation environment, and apparently weaknessin domestic demand as well.
