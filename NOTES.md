## License disclaimer

Our software is provided under the Apache 2.0 License, specifically applying to the code we have authored. Dependencies are listed as information only, to facilitate installation and operation by the end user. While we strive to ensure all our dependencies are compliant with the Apache 2.0 license, given the dynamic nature of software licensing—where packages may change licenses across versions—and particularly with the use of open-ended version ranges (>=), we cannot ensure perpetual license compliance of these dependencies.

Users are responsible for verifying the compliance of each dependency's license in relation to their project requirements. This includes conducting due diligence on the licensing of dependencies, especially considering potential changes in license terms with version updates. The onus to ensure full legal compliance with the licenses of all dependencies used lies with the user. We recommend consulting with legal expertise for any license compatibility concerns.

We commit to the open-source ethos of transparent and responsible software development. Should you have questions or need clarification regarding the licensing of dependencies, feel free to reach out.
