Nigeria,2010-01-04,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 67 of the 212th Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. January 4-5, 2010 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 4th and 5th January, 2010 to review domestic economic conditions in 2009 and the challenges faced by the Nigerian economy against the backdrop of developments in the international economic and financial environments in order to chart the course for monetary and financial sector policies for 2010. On the international economic scene, the Committee noted that developed countries that were most adversely affected by the severe economic and financial crises had started showing signs of recovery. The apparent rebound in global economic activity was being driven mainly by rising manufacturing activity, recovering housing markets and the restoration of consumer confidence. Although central banks around the world have undertaken large interest rate cuts and measures to inject liquidity into their economies, the risks still remain that the current rebound may be sluggish and that the global economy would remain credit-constrained in the near-to- medium-term, as financial institutions continue to maintain their cautious approach to credit extension. The Committee also noted that commodity prices, including crude oil prices, have resumed an upward trend due largely to the fiscal and monetary stimuli, and the prospect of economic recovery in advanced economies. The rising commodity prices have, however, renewed concerns about the resurgence of inflation in the near-term. The Committee further noted that emerging and developing market economies, on their part, have continued to 1 show strong resilience to the financial crises and recorded positive growth rates despite the harsh international economic and financial environment in 2009. On the domestic scene, the MPC underscored the need for strengthening on- going reform efforts in the banking sector aimed at engendering desirable medium term economic growth path consistent with price and financial stability. It further underlined the need to fast-track the proposed reforms in some key sectors of the Nigerian economy, and in particular, the power sector, to attract the much-needed private sector/foreign investment. This the Committee noted, was necessary because of the benefits in terms of the growth-enhancing and employment-creating potentials that these reforms and opening-up of the sectors would have on the rest of the economy. Key Domestic Macroeconomic and Financial Developments Output and Prices: Provisional data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 823 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2009, up from 450, 722 and 707 per cent in the first, second, and third quarters, respectively. Overall GDP growth for 2009 was projected at 690 per cent which is significantly higher than the 598 per cent recorded in 2008. The non-oil sector, as a group, remained the major driver of growth although this was complemented by the sharp increase in the growth of the oil sector GDP following the relative peace in the Niger Delta in the second half of the year. The Committee observed that the higher than anticipated real output growth recorded in Nigeria despite the harsh international economic environment mirrored the trends in some sub- Saharan African countries and further buttresses the view that African 2 countries were better able to withstand the global economic and financial crises relative to other regions of the world. The Committee felt that on the basis of the robust economic growth recorded and the sustained implementation of appropriate policies, further improvement in output could be expected in 2010. The headline inflation rate, as measured by the year-on-year increase in the all item consumer price index, was 124 per cent in November 2009, up from 116 and 104 per cent recorded in October and September, respectively. The outcome was, however, lower than the headline inflation of 151 per cent recorded in December 2008. Food inflation which hovered between 125 and 1290 per cent in the third quarter rose to 135 per cent in the fourth quarter of the year. Inflation outlook for 2010 remains uncertain, but a combination of both domestic and international economic developments, namely the impact of the planned full deregulation of petroleum products prices, the expansionary fiscal outlay, the quantitative easing measures undertaken by the Bank, the resolution costs associated with the banking sector reforms, possible capital inflows to strengthen commercial banks balance sheets, and the rising international commodity prices, pose serious threats to domestic price movements and, hence, inflation risk in the months ahead. Against this background, the Committee emphasized the need to continue to monitor price developments with a view to creating an enabling environment for sustainable economic growth and employment. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments: Over the preceding December level, broad money (M2) grew by 1280 per cent (on annualized basis) in November 2009, which was significantly below the indicative 3 benchmark of 208 per cent growth for 2009. Similarly the annualized growth rate of aggregate domestic credit (net) as at November 2009 was 5610 per cent, compared with the provisional benchmark growth rate of 8697 per cent for 2009. Despite the various policy measures implemented by the CBN to ensure adequate liquidity in the banking system, reserve money (RM) was largely below the indicative benchmarks for most of 2009. The annualized growth rate of private sector credit was 2610 per cent, significantly below the indicative benchmark of 4500 per cent but not in itself insignificant in view of all the developments in the banking sector. The trends in money supply movement reflected the fall in net foreign assets and the slowdown in credit to the private sector. This implied slack aggregate demand, indicating the need for the continuation of an accommodative monetary policy stance. Notwithstanding the sub-optimal monetary growth during the year, confidence in the money market has improved considerably following the inter-bank money market guarantee and other measures to strengthen the banking sector. This was reflected in the downward movement of the daily interbank call rates. Specifically the average call rate for November was 525 per cent down from 660 per cent in October and 976 per cent in September 2009. The secured open buy-back (OBB) rate for November was 453 per cent, down from 580 and 660 per cent in October and September, 2009, respectively. As at December 30 2009, the interbank call and OBB rates were 291 and 251 per cent, respectively. The spread reflecting counterparty credit risk, has narrowed significantly from an average of 316 basis points in September to 80 basis points, 72 basis points and 40 basis points in October. November, and December, respectively. The Committee observed that despite the falling interbank rates, the retail lending rates of deposit money banks (DMBs) were still high. The average maximum lending rate had risen to 231 per cent in November from 2297 and 2264 per cent in September and June, 2009, respectively. Also the average prime lending rate rose to 1893 per cent in November from 1833 and 1816 per cent in September and June, 2009, respectively. The Committee reaffirmed that the reduction of structural and institutional impediments as well as DMBs risk perception of borrowers could moderate the high lending rates. It also felt that current efforts by the Bank to promote the use of shared infrastructure by DMBs as well as the development of the fixed income market in conjunction with relevant agencies would further reduce cost of operation and moderate lending rates. The Committee noted the progress made so far in this area and urged an intensification of efforts and closer collaboration with political authorities to fast-track its actualization. The weak performance of the Nigerian capital market continued throughout 2009. Market Capitalization (MC), which stood at N696 trillion in December 2008 declined steadily to N4989 trillion on 31 December, 2009. The NSE has attributed the bearish performance at the stock market to the harsh operating environment and the gloomy economic outlook in 2009, which affected the quarterly results of some quoted companies. However the major stock 5 markets around the world have shown improved investor sentiments following prospects of recovery in the medium term. It was also noted that although banking shares in general have been badly affected by losses incurred, a number of companies in the non-bank sector have had strong performance in the stock exchange. External Sector Developments: The foreign exchange market remained relatively stable for the most part of 2009, after the initial turbulence recorded in the first quarter of the year, following measures taken by the CBN. In November, the WDAS average exchange rate stood at N15085 per US dollar compared with N1493578 per US dollar in October 2009, representing a depreciation of 10 per cent. As at end-December 2009, the WDAS average exchange rate was N14958 per US dollar compared with N12648 per dollar at end-December 2008. The inter-bank market rate averaged N15103/$US as at end December 2009. Thus as at end-2009, the spread between the WDAS and inter-bank market rates was insignificant. The convergence reflects renewed confidence and clarity in expectation, founded on the stability that has been sustained in exchange rates. Policy will continue to focus on avoiding volatility in exchange rates and thus retaining confidence. External reserves stood at US$4247 billion on 29th December 2009, down from the level of US$5300 billion recorded at end-December 2008. Overall the net outflow of foreign exchange has moderated significantly from US$56 billion. US$38 billion, and US$93193 million to US$13837 million in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. Notwithstanding the decline in the level of external reserves as at end- 6 December 2009, the Committee was satisfied that the level of reserves remained robust and significantly higher than initially projected at the beginning of the year. However if the elevated price of crude oil in the international market in recent months is sustained, then, given improvement in output with peace in the Niger Delta, there is likely to be an improvement in the level of foreign exchange reserves. The strong reserve position enhances the Bank’s ability to maintain exchange rate stability and protect the currency from speculative attack. The Committee’s Considerations The Committee welcomed the optimistic growth forecast for 2010 by the NBS but noted that the growth had been without employment owing to the stagnation in the manufacturing sector, and the failure to link growth in agriculture to industry. The Committee stressed the need for improvements in power and infrastructure to further enhance and sustain the growth process. In this regard, the MPC welcomes the commitment of the Bankers’ Committee at its Enugu Retreat to provide the platform for increased financing for infrastructural development in support of economic growth. It restated its commitment to work with the government to create the enabling environment that will facilitate the financing of the real sector by the DMBs, including strong advocacy for the fast-tracking of stalled reforms in the power sector, including review of the tariff regimes for gas and electricity and concessioning of the transmission company. The Committee also observed that the focus of the reform measures in the banking sector is to impact the overall efficiency and stability of the system in a manner that will ensure that banks play their appropriate roles as 7 transmission channels for resources to the real sector. This is expected to increase credit to the growth-enhancing sectors of the economy and therefore, engender an all inclusive growth, as well as avoid a recurrence of crises provoked by over exposure to speculative and non-value-adding ventures. The Committee further cautioned against being overly optimistic in our expectations about the outlook for the price of oil, and welcomed the prudent benchmark used in the budget for 2010. It noted that the current price of crude oil was being driven by the low value of the US dollar and the low interest rates in the US and once these reverse crude oil prices may be lower than they are today. It expressed the hope that all stake holders will give support to the Finance Ministry in keeping to this benchmark price, and resist the temptation to push for an increase based on short-term consideration. The Committee took cognizance of the expansionary nature of the 2010 Federal budget, the continued implementation of the 2009 Budget up to Q1 2010, expected liquidity injection/inflow during the recapitalization of the troubled banks and resolution of toxic asset problems, and the eventual deregulation of the downstream petroleum sector and their possible inflationary impact. In this regard, the MPC affirmed that it will closely monitor price developments in the near-term and will take appropriate policy measures, if necessary, to ensure the attainment of price and financial sector stability. On the other hand, the Committee recognised the need to maintain the growth trajectory of the economy, to ensure that lending rates are not placed under further upward pressure and to provide sufficient liquidity during the resolution process of the banking system. Decisions In the light of the above, the Committee unanimously took the following decisions: 1. The Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) will remain unchanged at 6 per cent with the asymmetric corridor of interest rates remaining at 200 basis points above the MPR and 400 basis points below the MPR. The CBN will extend the guarantee on all interbank transactions up till December 31, 2010. However the CBN has the discretion to terminate the guarantee on a case-by-case basis as part of the ongoing reform process. The MPC approved the Monetary Programme for 2010/2011 and the Monetary.

Romania,2010-01-05,"In its meeting of January 5, 2010, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR Board reiterates that the central bank will continue to closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by using its available instruments, to ensure the fulfillment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. The analysis of macroeconomic indicators developments reveals a temporary stagnation of disinflation in the context of a consolidation of the slowdown in adjusted CORE2 inflation amid a persistently severe economic contraction, along with a relative improvement of foreign investors' perception regarding the Romanian economy, given the softening tensions in the domestic political field. The annual inflation rate rose to 4.65 percent in November 2009 from 4.3 percent in the previous month due to increases in excise duties and food prices, but remained below the 6.3 percent level recorded in December 2008. It is worth noting that the higher excise duties on tobacco are estimated to have contributed 1.8 percentage points to last year's annual inflation rate. The adjusted annual CORE2 inflation  calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) as well as of the prices of major items subject to excise duties, i.e. tobacco and alcohol  remained on a downward trend, sliding to 3.3 percent in November 2009 from 3.4 percent a month before and 6.3 percent in December 2008. In the monetary area it is worth noting the continued slowdown in real terms of the annual dynamics of credit to the private sector, especially of the leu-denominated component, amid still weak demand for loans against the background of the recession. The annual growth of government credit stayed high, as the substantial budget deficit financing needs for the last quarter of 2009 contributed to the persistence of the spread between interbank money market rates and the monetary policy rate. The monetary policy stance was aimed at ensuring a consolidation of the perspectives of ensuring the convergence of inflation towards medium-term objectives and anchoring of inflation expectations in the context of heightened risks related to fiscal and income policies amid a volatile political climate in the last part of 2009. Therefore, the real broad monetary conditions remained prudent. As the effects of higher excise duties are expected to subside throughout 2010 and the multilateral external financing arrangement with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions is reactivated, favourable prospects for a consolidation of disinflation are to be expected. In this context, in order to ensure the convergence of inflation rate towards the announced medium-term targets, alongside a solid relaunch of the economic growth, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 7.5 percent per annum from 8.0 percent. Consequently, starting January 6, 2010, the rate on the deposit facility will be lowered to 3.5 percent per annum from 4.0 percent and the rate on the lending facility (Lombard) will be 11.5 percent per annum versus 12.0 percent. At the same time, the penalty rate for deficits of leu-denominated minimum reserve requirements will drop to 17.25 percent starting with the January 24-February 23, 2010, maintenance period. The NBR Board also decided to ensure a firm management of liquidity in the banking sector in order to consolidate the transmission of monetary policy signals as well as to maintain the existing level of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The ongoing prudent stance of the monetary policy, including an optimal dosage of the instruments available to the central bank, and the observance by the other components of the macroeconomic policy mix of the commitments agreed under the multilateral external financing arrangement are essential to ensure a sustainable disinflation and fulfilment of medium-term objectives. The NBR Board reiterates that the central bank will continue to closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by using its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for February 3, 2010, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Peru,2010-01-07,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2010 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 1.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference interest rate at 1.25 percent. This decision is based on the sustained reduction of annual inflation and on the continuous reduction of inflation expectations. Inflation in December recorded a rate of 0.3 percent due to seasonal factors and to the rise of fuel prices on December As a result of this, annual inflation recorded 0.25 percent rate below the target, in line with the Central Bank forecasts. This result was mainly influenced by the reversal of the increase observed in the prices of food and fuels last year. Core inflation, which isolates transitory changes in inflation, recorded 2.35 percent (within the target range). Advanced indicators of economic activity show clear signs of a recovery of the dynamism of production, but no signals of inflationary pressures in the short term. Unless important changes were to be observed in inflation forecasts and in inflation determinants, no new adjustments of the reference rate are foreseen. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 2.05 percent. Overnight deposits: 0.45 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.05 percent. In 2010, the Board will approve the Monetary Program for each month on the sessions to be held on the following dates: February 11 March 11 April 8 May 6 June 10 July 8 August 5 September 9 October 7 November 11 December 9 The BCRP will publish its Inflation Report on the following dates: March 26 June 18 September 17 December 17."
South Korea,2010-01-08,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. Domestic economic activity has continued on a recovering trend, which is expected to be maintained. Exports and domestic demand have continued to increase thanks to the progress of global economic situation. There still, however, remains uncertainty as to the economic growth path due to the risk of delay in a full-fledged recovery of the major advanced economies. Consumer price inflation has accelerated its rising pace, led by petroleum products and is anticipated to be further heightened temporarily by the influence of the heavy snowfalls. The upward trend of real estate prices has slowed. In the financial markets, long-term and short-term market interest rates and stock prices have shown a sharp run-up in line with the improvements in economic activity. Mortgage lending has grown on a steady scale. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain the accommodative policy stance for the time being in such a way as to help sustain the trend of recovery in economic activity."
Chile,2010-01-14,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 14 January 2010 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50% (annual). Internationally, recent data confirm global activity prospects for this year, which have had an incidence in a progressive stabilization of financial markets. The prices of copper and oil have risen again. Domestically, available information suggests that output and demand are expanding. The unemployment rate has continued to decline. Lending conditions have become less stringent. In December. CPI inflation and the various core measures declined. Wage dynamics remain in line with historical patterns. Reduced y-o-y inflation rates are foreseen for the coming quarters. Medium-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The Board estimates that the macroeconomic environment is consistent with a monetary policy interest rate that will be held at its minimum level of 0.50% at least until the second quarter of 2010. Accordingly, it reiterates that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected annual inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2010-01-14,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our first press conference in 2010. Let me take this opportunity to wish you all a Happy New Year. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 3 December 2009, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that towards the end of 2009 euro area economic activity continued to expand. However, some of the factors supporting the growth in real GDP are of a temporary nature. Overall, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, recognising that the recovery process is likely to be uneven and that the outlook remains subject to uncertainty. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, given the ongoing parallel decline in money and credit growth. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following the 0.4% quarter-on-quarter increase in real GDP in the third quarter of 2009, the latest information confirms that towards the end of last year economic activity in the euro area continued to expand. The euro area has been benefiting from a turn in the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports, as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. However, a number of the supporting factors are of a temporary nature. Furthermore, there is likely to be a drag on activity for some time to come on account of the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors, both inside and outside the euro area. In addition, low capacity utilisation rates are likely to dampen investment, and unemployment in the euro area is expected to increase somewhat further, thereby lowering consumption growth. For these reasons, the euro area economy is expected to grow only at a moderate pace in 2010 and the recovery process could be uneven. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced. On the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve further, and the global economy as well as foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disruptive market movements related to the correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, as expected, euro area annual HICP inflation increased further in December 2009 to stand at 0.9%, after 0.5% in November. The rise mainly reflects upward base effects stemming mostly from the drop in global energy prices a year ago. Looking further ahead, inflation is expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon, with overall price, cost and wage developments staying subdued in line with a slow recovery in demand in the euro area and elsewhere. In this context, it is important to emphasise, once again, that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. They relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, both the annual growth rates of M3 and loans to the private sector were negative in November, standing at -0.2% and -0.7% respectively. The concurrent declines to historically low growth rates recorded in these two series over the past months support the assessment of a decelerating underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. Looking ahead. M3 and credit growth are likely to remain very weak or negative for some time to come. The decline in actual monetary growth is likely to overstate the deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion. This is due to the continued steep slope of the yield curve, which explains shifts of funds out of M3 into longer-term deposits and securities. At the same time, the interest rate constellation continues to foster divergent developments in the main components of M3, as the narrow spreads between the rates on different short-term bank deposits reduce the opportunity costs of shifting funds from, for instance, short-term time deposits into overnight deposits. As a result. M1 continued to grow at a robust annual rate of 12.6% in November, when annual M3 growth turned negative. The negative annual growth of bank loans to the private sector conceals a return to positive annual rates of growth in the case of loans to households, while the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations became more negative. Such divergence remains in line with business cycle regularities, with turning points in the growth of loans to enterprises typically lagging those in economic activity. In the case of households, the latest data provide further confirmation of a levelling-off at low rates. In the case of non-financial corporations, the decline in loans continues to reflect mainly a strong net redemption of loans with a shorter maturity, while lending and borrowing at longer maturities remained positive. The subdued levels of production and trade, as well as the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the business outlook, will probably continue to dampen firms' demand for bank financing in the months to come. In the meantime, financing conditions for enterprises have improved over recent months in terms of the cost of both bank credit and market financing. In this respect, the continued negative flows in short-term bank loans to non-financial corporations observed in recent months may partly reflect better possibilities for substitution with different sources of longer-term financing. Banks have continued to reduce the size of their overall balance sheets, mainly through downsizing the assets held vis-à-vis other banks. The challenge remains to adjust the size and structure of balance sheets while ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector. To address this challenge, banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 3 December 2009, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that towards the end of 2009 euro area economic activity continued to expand. However, some of the factors supporting the growth in real GDP are of a temporary nature. Overall, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, recognising that the recovery process is likely to be uneven and that the outlook remains subject to uncertainty. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, given the ongoing parallel decline in money and credit growth. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. We will continue our enhanced credit support to the banking system, while taking into account the ongoing improvement in financial market conditions and avoiding distortions associated with maintaining non-standard measures for too long. The Governing Council will also continue to implement the gradual phasing-out of the extraordinary liquidity measures that are not needed to the same extent as in the past. In order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term, the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, many euro area governments are faced with high and sharply rising fiscal imbalances. The very large government borrowing requirements carry the risk of triggering rapid changes in market sentiment, leading to less favourable medium and long-term market interest rates. This, in turn, would dampen private investment and thereby weaken the foundations for sustained growth. Moreover, high levels of public deficit and debt would place an additional burden on monetary policy and undermine the credibility of the provisions of both the Treaty on European Union and the Stability and Growth Pact as a key pillar of Economic and Monetary Union. The Governing Council therefore calls upon governments to decide and implement in a timely fashion ambitious fiscal exit and consolidation strategies based on realistic growth assumptions, with a strong focus on expenditure reforms. Tax cuts should only be considered over the medium term, when countries have regained sufficient room for budgetary manoeuvre. In this regard, current government commitments to start consolidation in 2011 at the latest and to go well beyond the structural benchmark for adjustment of 0.5% of GDP per annum represent the minimum requirement for all euro area countries. The success of fiscal adjustment strategies will also depend, crucially, on appropriate national budgetary rules and institutions and requires transparent budgetary procedures, as well as reliable and complete government finance statistics. Turning to structural reforms, an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management, and transparent as well as robust business models are key to strengthening banks' resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and financial stability. The Eurosystem will submit its response to the European Commission's public consultation on the EU 2020 strategy, which is designed as a successor to the current Lisbon strategy. To address future challenges, the EU 2020 strategy should focus on raising potential growth and creating high levels of employment through well-functioning labour and product markets, sound financial systems and sustainable fiscal policies. The aim is to achieve a highly competitive social market economy, as spelled out in the Treaty."
Turkiye,2010-01-14,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep policy rates unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 6.50 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 2.50 percent, lending rate at 12 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent. Recent data releases suggest that the moderate recovery in the economic activity is ongoing. However, there are still uncertainties regarding the aggregate demand, and the capacity utilization and employment conditions are expected to take a long time to fully recover. The Committee has indicated that inflation would rise significantly in the next two months due to tax adjustments and base effects, hovering above the target for some time. Yet, the underlying trend implied by core inflation indicators is expected to remain at levels consistent with medium term targets. In this respect, it has been emphasized that inflation would display a declining trend once the temporary factors die out. The Committee has noted that credit markets have continued to improve in response to the monetary easing and the improvements in global risk perceptions. However, lingering problems across the global economy are not resolved completely and there are still uncertainties regarding the strength of the recovery. Accordingly, the Committee has emphasized that it would be necessary to keep policy rates at low levels for a long period of time. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Georgia,2010-01-20,"20.01.10 The NBG Keeps its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) unchanged at 5 Percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on January 20, 2010 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 5 percent. The annual rate of inflation at the end of 2009 was 3 percent and average annual inflation stands at 1.7 percent. According to the existing forecasts, inflation should remain around the 6-percent mark in 2010. The real effective exchange rate fluctuated throughout the year and in the end, the exchange rate depreciated by 3.6 percent. The banking sector is experiencing a liquidity surplus in domestic currency in the short term, although a long-run GEL liquidity deficit exists. Exogenous factors are responsible for an increase in the prices of several of the main consumer commodity products. At the same time, aggregate demand is low due to seasonal factors. This has induced the surplus of the Georgian Lari that was balanced by the Government's operations. According to the National Bank's estimates, the reduction in gross domestic product for 2009 exceeded 4 percent, although a more-than 2 percent growth of the economy is expected in 2010. Signs of economic recovery are evident, although, like in many other countries, the rate of recovery of the remains uncertain. The influence of monetary policy in the short term markets is weak, and the national bank will activate instruments of monetary policy in order to increase efficiency of the transmission mechanism, although simulative monetary policy will remain. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on February 17, 2010."
Hungary,2010-01-25,"At its meeting on 25 January 2010, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by 25 basis points from 6.25% to 6.00%, with effect from 26 January 2010. In the Monetary Council's judgement. Hungarian growth is likely to resume in the middle of 2010 as the economy recovers from last year's sharp downturn. Inflation is expected to remain elevated temporarily due to the tax increases, and then to move materially below the Bank's 3% target in the second half of the year. Global appetite for risk has been volatile in recent months, and there remains considerable uncertainty about future conditions in global financial markets. Domestic economic performance has been driven by a modest pick-up in demand abroad and a continuing decline in demand at home, which, in turn, has contributed to a reduction in the current account deficit to close to balance. Hungarian economic recovery is likely to lag behind that of developed countries and the economies of Central and Eastern Europe on account of persistently weak domestic demand. The decline in consumption has been a major factor shaping movements in the prices of products dominating the medium-term outlook for inflation. Items excluded from core inflation accounted for most of the increase in inflation over the past two months. The Monetary Council continues to expect inflation to fall substantially below the 3% target at a horizon out to 12 years. The deterioration in global financial market sentiment and assessments of risks associated with Hungarian financial assets in December did not continue over the past month. However, investors continued to be concerned about the sustainability of government debt in a number of developed countries. In order to reduce Hungary's high government debt and vulnerability to external shocks, it is particularly important to maintain a disciplined, long-term sustainable fiscal policy. The Monetary Council saw scope for only a cautious reduction in interest rates, due to the uncertainty surrounding future developments in world financial markets. The Council therefore has decided to reduce the base rate by 25 basis points. Even if justified by the outlook for inflation and the economy, interest rates may only be reduced further if changes in perceptions of risks associated with the economy allow it. The Monetary Council's assessment of inflation performance in 2009. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the Bank's inflation target was not met in 2009, despite the fall in consumer price inflation to close to the 3% target in early 2009. Subsequently however, inflation rose slightly above 5% in the second half, mainly on account of the effects of the tax changes in the course of the year. Nevertheless, the Council judges that inflation developments in 2009 brought about a market change compared with the previous period, given the break in the inflation inertia of previous years. This is most clearly reflected in the slowdown in services price inflation. After fluctuating around 5%6% in previous years, the services price index eased back to stand close to 3% in 2009, after adjusting for the effects of indirect tax increases. Trend inflation developments suggest that recently the inflation target has come within reach. Prior to the indirect tax increases, in 2009 H1, the annual price index was practically consistent with the inflation target; core inflation, excluding volatile items, was 3.2% on average in the period JanuaryJune. Short-run measures of inflation, adjusted for the effects of indirect tax increases, were below target throughout the second half of the year. Weak demand  driven by the severe economic downturn  has put downward pressure on inflation and has reduced the risk that inflation might be stuck temporarily at high levels. The Monetary Council will use its best efforts to help the Hungarian economy to move towards price stability. Achieving and maintaining price stability is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to growth and a predictable economic environment over the long term."
Israel,2010-01-25,"25.01.2010 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for February 2010 unchanged The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for February 2010 will be unchanged at 1.25 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: After predictions of an increase of 0.3-0.4 percent, the December CPI surprised the forecasters with no change in the index, with the owner-occupied-housing component recording an unexpected decrease of 0.8 percent. Inflation in 2009 was 3.9 percent; excluding the price rises resulting from tax increases and surcharges it was 2.8 percent, within the upper part of the target inflation range. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation expectations forthe next twelve months derived from the capital market increased after thepublication of the index for December, and averaged 2.7 percent in January, an increase of 0.2 of a percentage point from their level in December. Following the publication of the December index, the average of forecasters' inflation expectations for the next twelve months declined from 2.7 percentto 2.3 percent. They expect, on average, that prices will fall by a cumulative 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2010. Forecasters' expectations of the Bank of Israel interest rate in a year's time are on average that it will be 2.8 percent, and expectations derived from the capital market are that it will be 2.5 percent. Real economic activity: The latest indicators strengthen the assessment that economic activity improved substantially in the fourth quarter of 2009, with the improvement encompassing most sectors. Data from the Bankof Israel Companies Survey for that quarter indicate a marked increase in business sector activity. All industries apart from the hotel industry showed increases. The composite state-of-the-economy index rose by 0.4 percent in December, but the October index was revised downwards from a 0.6 percentincrease to 0.5 percent, and the November index from 0.6 percent to 0.4 percent. In January the Bank of Israel revised its forecast of growth in Israel in 2010 upwards, from 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent, in light of the latesteconomic data and in light of increased forecasts of the growth in world trade. In contrast, the purchasing managers index declined in December, but is still close to the record levels it reached in the last few years. The Globes consumers confidence index also dropped in December, but it, too, remains close to its peak of the last few years. The probability of a slowdown, as measured at the Bank of Israel by the Google search index, rose slightly. The labor market and wages: There was a significant improvement in employment in 2009:Q 4. Unemployment trend data for November show a reduction in unemployment to 7.4 percent. Final figures from the Ministry of Industry. Trade and Labor Employers Survey show a sharp rise in the balance of employment (the difference between the number of positions filled and the number of terminations of employment), and currently it is positive for the first time after four consecutive quarters of a negative balance. The Companies Survey for the fourth quarter of 2009 shows that the decline in the number of employees evident in the previous quarters moderated. Health tax revenues in November indicate that the positive trend in total wage payments that started in July 2009 continued. In addition, the reduction in the number of claims for unemployment payments continued in December. National Insurance Institute data on the real wage in August-October show that it fell by 2.8 percent year on year, while the nominal wage increased by 0.1 percent. Budget data: The total budget deficit in 2009, excluding credit, was 5.15 percent of GDP (NIS 39.3 billion), compared with 6 percent originally planned. In November and December there was a strong surge in tax revenues, particularly of indirect taxes. In those months government expenditureexceeded the seasonal expenditure path as some 2010 expenditure was brought forward. The lower-than-planned deficit was mainly the result of revenuesexceeding the assessments made when the budget was drawn up. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the previous monetary policy discussions of December 27 and January 24, the shekel strengthened by 1.7 percent against the dollar, by 3.5 percent against the euro, and by 2.1 percent in terms of the index of the nominal effective exchange rate vis-?-vis the currencies of Israel's trading partners (weighted by thevolume of trade). At the beginning of the period the dollar and the euro weakened against most other currencies, and at the end of the period the dollar showed a mixed trend against the other currencies. The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of December 27 and January 24, the Tel Aviv 25 index fell by 1.5 percent, and the Tel Aviv 100 index by 0.3 percent. This was similar to the trend in the major stock exchanges, and was mainly due to a deterioration in investors' attitude in the last few days, reflected by their increased risk aversion and falls in the prices of riskier assets. Yields on government bonds dropped this month--yields on unindexed 10-year shekel bonds fell by 24 basis points (b.p.). As yields on 10-year US government bonds dropped by 20 b.p., to 3.61 percent, the yield gap between Israeli and US unindexed government bonds remained relatively steady at 140 b.p. Over the above period the yield on twelve-month makam was stable at 1.92 percent. The Tel-Bond 20 index rose in the period by 1.9 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 2.5 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, declined by 4 b.p. to 1.24 percent; CDS spreads around the world showed a similar trend. The money supply: The M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) decreased by 1.2 percent in December, following its increase of 1.2 percent in November. The M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits up to one year) increased by 0.1 percent in December' after falling by 0.1 percent in November. The world economy: The global economy continued its recovery fromthe crisis, and growth accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2009. Data published in the course of the last month indicate, however, that there are differences in the recovery rate between countries and between sectors. This is very clear in the differences between the emerging countries in Asia on the one hand, and the European and Japanese economies on the other. The weakness of private demand and the slack in the labor market continue to impair growth, especially in the advanced economies. Foreign analysts assess that the rate of growth will slow in 2010 when the effects of the various emergency measures have run their course and when steps are taken to end the rescue programs. The extent of substitution between private and public consumption when the latter is reduced constitutes one of the major causes of uncertainty with regard to growth forecasts in those countries where governments gave very significant support to deal with the crisis. Despite the recent increase in commodity and energy prices, inflation and inflation expectations in the advanced economies remained low, mainly because of the continued weakness of the labor market and the large output gap. Against this background, monetary policy is expected to continue to be expansionary, alongside a gradual exit from the special support programs, with modest increases in interest rates only after that stage. The very low level of interest rates in the major economies continues to serve as an incentive for price increases in the financial markets, and encourages the export of capital to the emerging markets. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for February unchanged at 1.25 percent is part of the gradual process of returning interest to a normal level; the process is intended to return inflation to within the target rangeand to contribute to the further recovery of economic activity, while supporting financial stability. The path of the interest rate will be determined in accordance with the inflation environment, the degree of firmness of growth, both global and in Israel, and the rate at which the major central banks increase their interest rates. The December CPI was surprisingly low, with the main surprise being the decline in theowner-occupied-housing component. The forecast is that inflation during the first quarter of 2010 will also be low, due in part to the appreciation of the shekel. Inflation expectations for 2010, those derived from the capital market (2.7 percent) and the average of forecasters' expectations (2.3 percent), are both within the target range. Recent economic activity is continuing to develop positively. Against this backgroundthe Bank of Israel revised its growth forecast for 2010 upwards. Recently,however, uncertainty has risen with regard to the strength of the global recovery. Interest rates of the leading central banks around the world are very low, and are expected to remain so during the coming months. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic and financial developments, and will use the instruments available to itto achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on 8 February 2010. The decision regarding the interest rate for March 2010 will be published at 17:30 on 22 February 2010. 25.01.2010 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for February 2010 unchanged. The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for February 2010 unchanged. The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for February 2010 will be unchanged at 1.25 percent. Background conditions.

Malaysia,2010-01-26,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 2.00 percent. The recovery in the global economy continues to gather pace, supported by continued expansionary economic policies, improved financial conditions and a strong rebound in several emerging economies. While the growth momentum in regional economies is expected to strengthen further in 2010, there remains uncertainty on the prospects for the advanced economies as growth continues to depend on policy stimulus measures, and the sustainability of private sector demand amid ongoing financial system resolution and reforms. In the domestic economy, recent economic indicators suggest that the economy expanded favourably in the fourth quarter of 2009. Positive developments in manufacturing production, financing activity, external trade and labour market conditions reaffirm the assessment that the economic recovery is gaining strength. Going forward, the economy is expected to expand further in 2010, with growth being supported by strengthening domestic demand, particularly private consumption, and further improvements in external demand. Inflation turned positive in December. The change largely reflects the lapse of the impact from the adjustment to retail fuel prices in 2008. The pace of price increase for the year is projected to be gradual, reflecting the prevailing economic conditions and taking into account some adjustments in administered prices. In the absence of further price revisions and external influences, a positive but modest inflation rate is expected in 2010. Moving forward, monetary policy would remain accommodative to ensure that the economic recovery is well entrenched. At the same time, the MPC also recognizes the need to ensure that the stance of monetary policy is appropriate to prevent the build up of financial imbalances that could arise from interest rates being too low for a prolonged period of time.

Poland,2010-01-26,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 26 January 2010 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 25-26 January 2010 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate at 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) discount rate at 4.00% on an annual basis. Released data point to a further growth in economic activity in the United States and a slightly weaker improvement in economic conditions in the euro area as compared to the US economy. However, situation in the labour market in the developed economies remains unfavourable and their lending continues to shrink. At the same time. GDP growth is accelerating in the largest emerging economies, including China, where the risk connected with excessive lending and asset prices growth has also recently increased. The recovery in economic activity around the world is still being supported by highly expansive macroeconomic policy based on both conventional and non- standard instruments. Over the recent period the prices of financial assets in developed economies have remained relatively stable, while oil prices have displayed considerable volatility. Those economies have seen a rise in headline inflation, which was mainly the result of higher annual growth of energy prices. The latest data on the Polish economy indicate an improvement in economic activity. Despite increase in the unemployment rate, relative stabilisation of employment in the enterprise sector may signal a gradual deceleration of the unfavourable labour market tendencies. Lending to the enterprise sector is still shrinking and the growth in loans to the household sector remains considerably lower than in the past few years. In December 2009 the annual CPI rose to 3.5%, thus equalled to the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target of 2.5%. Rise in the annual inflation rate was primarily supported by the positive base effect connected with a strong decline in fuel prices in December 2008. At the same time, core inflation net of food and energy prices decreased slightly to 2.6%, which was mainly related to the slowing growth of services prices. In the Council's assessment, in the months to come inflation will be lowered by negative base effects connected with the surge in administered prices and food prices at the beginning of 2009. Other factors conducive to lower inflation include: low demand pressure, previously observed moderate growth of labour costs and the previous zloty appreciation. In turn, inflation decline in 2010 may be curbed by rises in: commodity prices in the world markets, fees subject to local governments' decisions, excise duty, and administered prices. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. The Council assesses the probabilities of inflation running below or above the inflation target in the medium term to be balanced. In the Council's view, the improvement in global economic activity and the previously implemented monetary policy easing support the return of the economy to the potential growth path. The impact of expansionary macroeconomic policies abroad and their prospective reversal on the future global economic growth and inflation constitute a significant source of uncertainty for domestic monetary policy. An important factor affecting monetary policy is the situation of the public finance sector. Introducing measures aimed at permanently reducing the deficit of the general government sector would support maintaining macroeconomic stability and allow to meet criteria for euro adoption. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts required for euro adoption in Poland. The Council approved The Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland in 2009 Q3."
South Africa,2010-01-26,"Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas declined from 6,1 per cent in September 2009 to 5,9 per cent and 5,8 per cent in October and November respectively. The categories of housing and utilities, and miscellaneous goods and services remained the single biggest contributors to the inflation outcome in November, having contributed 1,7 and 1,5 percentage points respectively. These categories were mainly driven by electricity and insurance cost increases. Food price inflation continued to moderate, and measured 4,0 per cent in November, while administered prices excluding petrol and paraffin increased by 11,0 per cent, primarily as a result of electricity price increases. Producer prices declined at year-on-year rates of 3,3 per cent and 1,2 per cent in October and November respectively. The underlying producer price trends in the food sector remained favourable for further moderation in food price inflation at the consumer level. In November, agricultural prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 0,9 per cent, while manufactured food prices declined by 1,1 per cent. CPI inflation is expected to increase to above the target range in the coming three months, due to technical base effects related to petrol price changes. Current forecasts indicate that inflation could measure around 6,5 per cent in December and January, before moderating in the subsequent months. Because of the forward-looking nature of monetary policy, the focus of the MPC is on the longer-term expected trend of inflation. The CPI inflation forecast by the South African Reserve Bank (the Bank) is predominantly unchanged since the November forecast. In line with market forecasts, inflation is expected to return to within the inflation target range on a sustained basis in March 2010, and remain within the target range until the end of the forecast period in the final quarter of 2011, when it is forecast to average 5,4 per cent. Since the previous Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. Eskom has modified its tariff application to the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA). Given the continued uncertainty related to the electricity tariff increases, the forecast does not make provision for the full multi-year increases of 35 per cent requested by Eskom, and electricity price increases of 25 per cent in 2010 and 2011 are assumed. The outcome of the Eskom application is expected to be announced in February. The most recent inflation expectations survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at Stellenbosch University shows that in the fourth quarter of 2009 there were no significant changes in expectations compared with the previous survey. According to the survey, inflation is expected to average 7,5 per cent in 2010 and 7,7 per cent in 2011. While both business and trade union respondents continued to expect inflation to remain outside the target range, the forecasts of financial analysts deteriorated moderately but remained within the target range. The latter forecasts were in line with the Reuters survey, which in January showed that market analysts expect inflation to average 5,7 per cent and 5,8 per cent in 2010 and 2011 respectively. The demand-side pressures on inflation have been persistently weak, and the MPC remains of the view that there are no significant upside risks to the inflation outlook emanating from this source. Real final consumption expenditure by households has contracted on a quarter-on-quarter annualised basis since the third quarter of 2008. In the third quarter of 2009 household consumption expenditure declined by 2,0 per cent. This weak trend appears to have continued in the final quarter of 2009. Real retail trade sales declined at a year-on-year rate of 6,6 per cent in November 2009 and by 5,9 per cent in the three months to end November compared with the same period in 2008. Wholesale trade sales also declined in November. New vehicle sales continue to show some signs of improvement, but nevertheless contracted by 7,2 per cent in December on a year-on-year basis. Consumer confidence appears to have improved, however, as reflected in the FNB/BER consumer confidence index which recorded its highest reading since the first quarter of 2008. Adverse employment trends and employment insecurity are likely to constrain household consumption expenditure. According to Statistics South Africa's Quarterly Employment Statistics, employment levels decreased further during the third quarter of 2009, despite a more favourable growth performance. Formal non-agricultural employment declined by 4,2 per cent in this quarter, representing almost 110,000 jobs. Employment is expected to lag the growth recovery. Credit extension to the private sector reflects the weak demand and tight credit supply conditions, and is also seen as a constraint on spending. There are, however, indications that the strict lending criteria applied by banks, in response to higher perceived risk and rising impaired advances, may be easing. In November 2009, impaired advances as a percentage of total gross loans and advances increased to 5,9 per cent from 5,8 per cent the previous month. Total loans and advances to the private sector contracted by 2,0 per cent in November compared with the previous year. This was the third consecutive month of credit contraction. The only component of credit extension which recorded positive nominal growth was mortgage advances, which grew at a twelve month rate of 3,0 per cent. These developments were also reflected in the level of household debt, where the ratio of household debt to disposable income declined from 80,1 per cent in the second quarter of 2009 to 79 per cent in the third quarter. This relatively high level of debt is expected to continue to constrain consumption expenditure. While the combination of increased unemployment, the lack of access to credit and the need to repair impaired household balance sheets is expected to dominate consumption trends in the coming quarters, there have been some positive developments with respect to wealth effects. House prices have shown signs of improvements, with the ABSA and FNB house price indices showing positive but moderate growth. Equity prices have recovered somewhat since their lows in March of 2009, but the recent equity market decline both domestically and abroad show that some volatility may persist in line with uncertainty relating to the sustainability of the global recovery. There are continued signs that the domestic economic recovery is underway following the 0,9 per cent annualised GDP growth rate measured in the third quarter of 2009. However, the recovery is expected to remain relatively subdued and below the potential growth rate of the economy for some time. The forecast of the Bank is that GDP growth will average 2,0 per cent in 2010 and 3,0 per cent in 2011. Nonetheless it could take some time until pre-recession levels of output are reached. The more positive outlook is in line with the continued positive trends seen in the composite leading business cycle indicator of the Bank which increased strongly again in November. The coincident indicator also exhibited a slight upward movement. These trends are in line with the more positive outlook seen in the RMB/BER business confidence index during the fourth quarter of 2009. The manufacturing sector has also shown signs of some recovery and is expected to contribute positively to the 2009 fourth quarter growth outcome. The physical volume of manufacturing production declined at a year-on-year rate of 4,7 per cent in November, but increased by 3,9 per cent in the three months to November compared to the previous three months. The Kagiso Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) also reflected a positive outlook in November and December. However the manufacturing sector may be constrained by weak domestic demand, while external demand will be impacted by the strength of the global recovery as well as, in part, by exchange rate developments. The rand has remained a positive factor from an inflation perspective. However the MPC is cognisant of the negative impact of the rand's movements during the past year on some sectors of the economy. Since the previous MPC meeting, the rand/dollar exchange rate has fluctuated between around R7,28 and R7,73. On a trade weighted basis, the rand is more or less unchanged since the previous meeting. Much of the volatility of the exchange rate during this period can be explained by general volatility in the international foreign exchange markets where the US dollar fluctuated in a range of US$1,41 and US$1,51 against the euro. With the decline of risk aversion in global markets, emerging markets in general, including South Africa, have also had to deal with significant capital inflows. These inflows have put upward pressure on a number of emerging market currencies. Intervention to prevent these appreciations is often costly and not always effective. At the same time the possibility of reversals of these flows, should global sentiment change, poses a risk to the exchange rate outlook in these countries. The global recovery has continued with relatively strong performances in some of the emerging market economies. However risks and vulnerabilities still remain, particularly in a number of countries in the euro area, and the recovery is expected to remain relatively slow in some economies that are important export destinations for South African goods. Unsustainable fiscal positions as well as the need to reverse previous unconventional monetary policy interventions may also pose a risk to the global growth outlook. The global environment remains benign from an inflation perspective. Despite moderately higher commodity prices, there are no significant risks to the global inflation outlook. Other supply side or exogenous factors are not expected to impart a significant upside risk to the inflation forecast. International oil prices appear to have stabilised somewhat over the past months, and moderate increases have been assumed over the forecast period. The outlook for food price inflation, as reflected in producer prices and futures prices, is favourable and these prices are unlikely to pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook for some time despite higher food prices in international markets. The risk to the inflation outlook emanating from wage developments appears to have subsided somewhat. Wage settlements are still in excess of inflation, but have been declining in nominal terms. Average nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sector moderated to 7,6 per cent in the third quarter of 2009, while the nominal unit labour cost increase in the third quarter compared with the same quarter the previous year measured 5,7 per cent. Electricity price increases remain the single biggest risk to the inflation outlook. There is the risk that increases granted to Eskom could be markedly higher than those assumed in the Bank's forecast, and there is also the risk that the second-round effects of these increases may be underestimated by the forecasting model. The MPC noted that inflation is likely to remain close to the upper end of the target range over the forecast period, and is of the view that the risks to this outlook are fairly evenly balanced. Electricity price increases pose the biggest upside risk, counteracted by the weak state of domestic demand. Against this background the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7,0 per cent per annum."
Philippines,2010-01-27,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates steady at 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. In its assessment of prevailing economic and financial conditions, the Monetary Board emphasized that the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate. Latest inflation forecasts continue to fall within a target-consistent path in 2010 and 2011, with moderate demand pressures and manageable inflation expectations. The domestic economy is expected to expand at a modest pace (2.6-3.6 percent based on official forecasts) alongside the recovery in the global economy, which is being propped up in part by monetary and fiscal stimulus measures. The Board noted that, with the favorable inflation outlook, keeping policy rates steady would continue to support economic activity. The Monetary Board also decided to set the peso rediscount rate equal to the overnight RRP rate effective 1 February 2010. It will be recalled that the Board approved, effective 2 March 2009, a peso rediscount rate that was 50 basis points lower than the overnight RRP rate as part of a package to liberalize banks' access to the BSP's rediscounting facility and ensure the orderly operation of domestic financial markets should global financial conditions worsen. Since the risk of contagion from global financial stresses is markedly reduced, with the sustained stability in global financial markets, the need for more liberalized pricing of rediscounting loans is now less. Continued stability in liquidity conditions also warrants the reversion in pricing. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor closely all developments that could affect the assessment of risks to inflation over the policy horizon, including signs of a build-up in upward pressures on commodity prices."
United States,2010-01-27,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the deterioration in the labor market is abating. Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained by a weak labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software appears to be picking up, but investment in structures is still contracting and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Firms have brought inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth. Although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for a time, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability. With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. In order to promote a smooth transition in markets, the Committee is gradually slowing the pace of these purchases, and it anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter. The Committee will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve will be closing the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities Lending Facility on February 1, as previously announced. In addition, the temporary liquidity swap arrangements between the Federal Reserve and other central banks will expire on February 1. The Federal Reserve is in the process of winding down its Term Auction Facility: $50 billion in 28-day credit will be offered on February 8 and $25 billion in 28-day credit will be offered at the final auction on March 8. The anticipated expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain set at June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral. The Federal Reserve is prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A Duke; Donald L Kohn; Sandra Pianalto; Eric S Rosengren; Daniel K Tarullo; and Kevin M Warsh. Voting against the policy action was Thomas M Hoenig, who believed that economic and financial conditions had changed sufficiently that the expectation of exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period was no longer warranted."
India,2010-01-29,"Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2009-10: Press Statement by Dr.D. Subbarao. Governor ""This morning. I had a meeting with the chiefs of major banks where we released and disseminated the Third Quarter Review of RBI's monetary policy. First a few words on the response of the banks before I give an overview of the macroeconomic situation and the Reserve Bank's policy stance. Banks generally welcomed the Reserve Bank's policy stance. They indicated that the monetary measures announced by the Reserve Bank may not put immediate pressure on lending rates. Apart from monetary policy, discussions centred around specific issues such as credit growth and monetary transmission; government market borrowing programme; infrastructure financing; and financial inclusion. Banks felt that credit growth prospects remain favourable going forward. They emphasised the need to expand their capital to sustain their lending operations in future. Banks indicated that they have reduced their lending rates responding to earlier monetary easing by the Reserve Bank. Consequently, their net interest margins have come under pressure. Non-performing assets (NPAs) are expected to increase, particularly from the restructured assets. They felt that if the government borrowings next year are large, they could put pressure on resources and interest rates as credit is expected to pick up significantly. Banks were concerned about their growing exposure to the infrastructure sector and suggested that policy intervention is required from the Government and the Reserve Bank to address the issue of the asset-liability mismatch and exposure in their balance sheets. Finally, banks assured the Reserve Bank that they share its commitment to financial inclusion and indicated that they are working on expanding banking facilities in unbanked areas. Global Economy The global economy is showing increasing signs of stabilisation with the Asian region experiencing a relatively stronger rebound. Global economic performance improved during the third and fourth quarters of 2009, prompting the IMF to reduce the projected rate of economic contraction in 2009 from 1.1 per cent made in October 2009 to 0.8 per cent in January 2010. The IMF has also revised the projection of global growth for 2010 to 3.9 per cent, up from 3.1 per cent. However, significant risks remain: the recovery is driven largely by government spending in many economies; commodity and asset prices have risen aided by high levels of global liquidity; and emerging market economies (EMEs), which are generally recovering faster than advanced economies, are likely to face increased inflationary pressures.2 Indian Economy Growth The Indian economy showed a degree of resilience as it recorded a better- than-expected growth of 7.9 per cent during the second quarter of 2009-10. Subsequent data releases confirm the assessment that the economy is steadily gaining momentum, though public expenditure continues to play a dominant role, and performance across sectors is uneven, suggesting that recovery is yet to become sufficiently broad-based. In the Second Quarter Review of October 2009, we projected GDP growth for 2009-10 of 6 per cent with an upside bias. Recent movements in the indicators of real sector activity suggest that the upside bias has materialised. Assuming a near zero growth in agricultural production and continued recovery in industrial production and services sector activity, the baseline projection for GDP growth for 2009-10 is now raised to 7.5 per cent. Looking ahead to 2010-11, our preliminary assessment of the baseline scenario is that the current growth will be sustained. We shall formally indicate our growth projection for 2010-11 in April 2010. Inflation For several months, rapidly rising food inflation has been a cause for concern. There are indications that the sustained increase in food prices is beginning to spill over into other commodities and services as well. The October 2009 Review projected WPI inflation for end-March 2010 of 6.5 per cent with an upside bias. The upside risk in terms of higher food prices reflecting the poor south-west monsoon has already materialised. Some additional factors such as higher global crude prices and less than expected seasonal moderation in food prices have also exerted upward pressure on inflation. Based on the latest evidence, the baseline projection for WPI inflation for end-March 2010 is now raised to 8.5 per cent. As in the case of growth, we shall formally announce our inflation projection for 2010-11 in April 2010. However, on the assumption of a normal monsoon and global oil prices remaining around the current level, it is expected that inflation will moderate from July 2010. This moderation in inflation will depend on several factors, including the measures taken and to be taken by the Reserve Bank as a part of the normalisation process. Money and Credit Aggregates During the current financial year, the year-on-year growth in money supply (M ) moderated from over 20 per cent at the beginning of the financial year to 16.5 3 per cent on January 15, 2010, reflecting deceleration in bank credit growth. Year-on- year non-food credit growth recovered to over 14 per cent by mid-January 2010 from the trough of around 10 per cent in October 2009. Corporates had better access to non-bank sources of funds which, to a large extent, mitigated the impact of slowdown in bank credit growth. The indicative adjusted non-food credit growth for 2009-10 is now reduced to 16 per cent from the earlier projection of 18 per cent and M growth during 2009-10 has been reduced to 16.5 per cent for policy purposes 3 from the earlier projection of 17 per cent.3 Financial Markets Financial markets continued to remain orderly and overnight money market rates remained below or close to the lower bound of the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) rate corridor as liquidity conditions remained comfortable. Despite large government borrowings, yields remained contained due to lower credit demand, open market operations (OMO) and active liquidity management by the Reserve Bank. Equity markets are behaving in a manner consistent with global patterns. Risk Factors While the baseline scenario is comforting, a number of downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation need to be recognised. These include uncertainty about the pace and shape of the global recovery; the surge in oil prices, if global recovery is stronger than expected; uncertainty about the performance of the south-west monsoon in 2010; sharp increase in capital flows, above the absorptive capacity of the economy, which may complicate exchange rate and monetary management; and accentuation of inflation expectations, if excess liquidity is allowed to persist in the face of a narrowing output gap. In addition, a bigger risk to both short-term economic management and to medium-term economic prospects emanates from the large fiscal deficit. As the recovery gains momentum, it is important that there is coordination in the fiscal and monetary exits. The reversal of monetary accommodation cannot be effective unless there is also a roll back of government borrowings. It is imperative, therefore, that the government returns to a path of fiscal consolidation which can begin with a phased roll back of the transitory components. Beyond that, the Government should indicate a roadmap for fiscal consolidation and also spell out the broad contours of tax policies and expenditure compression that will define this roadmap. Monetary Policy Stance The Reserve Bank announced the first phase of exit from the expansionary monetary policy by terminating some sector-specific facilities and restoring the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks to a pre-crisis level in the Second Quarter Review of October 2009. Against the backdrop of the current global and domestic macroeconomic conditions, outlooks and risks, our policy stance is shaped by three important considerations: First, a consolidating recovery should encourage us to clearly and explicitly shift our stance from ‘managing the crisis' to ‘managing the recovery', and it is necessary to carry forward the process of exit further; Second, even though the inflationary pressures in the domestic economy predominantly stem from the supply side, the consolidating recovery increases the risks of these pressures spilling over into a wider inflationary process; and Third, strong anti-inflationary measures may undermine the recovery which is yet to fully take hold. On the basis of the above overall assessment, the stance of monetary policy for the remaining period of 2009-10 will be as follows: Anchor inflation expectations and keep a vigil on the trends in inflation and be prepared to respond swiftly and effectively through policy adjustments as warranted. Actively manage liquidity to ensure that credit demands of productive sectors are adequately met consistent with price stability.4 To maintain an interest rate environment consistent with price stability and financial stability, and in support of the growth process. Monetary Policy Measures Our Third Quarter Review specifies the following monetary measures: The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks has been increased by 75 basis points in two stages from 5.0 per cent to 5.75 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL). As a result of the CRR increase, about Rs.36,000 crore of excess liquidity will be absorbed from the system. The policy rates, both the repo rate and the reverse repo rate have been retained at their current levels. Expected Outcome We expect three major outcomes from the above policy action: Reduction in excess liquidity will help anchor inflationary expectations. ii) The recovery process will be supported without compromising price stability. iii) The calibrated exit will align policy instruments with the current and evolving state of the economy. Way Forward The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions, particularly the price situation closely and take further action as warranted."" G.

Romania,2010-02-03,"In its meeting of February 3, 2010, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for February 5, 2010, along with a 12-month calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues. The annual inflation rate stood at 4.74 percent in December 2009, 0.24 percentage points above the upper limit of the variation band around the target, mainly due to increases in excise duties on tobacco and fuel prices, but was below the 6.3 percent level recorded at the end of 2008. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation  calculated by excluding the impact of administered prices and volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) as well as of the prices of major items subject to excise duties, i.e. tobacco and alcohol  continued the downward trend started in April 2009, dropping to 2.8 percent in December 2009 from 6.3 percent in the same 2008 period. The analysis of developments in macroeconomic indicators reveals a persistent deficit of aggregate demand, a consolidation of the current account deficit at sustainable levels as well as the continued slowdown in real terms of the annual dynamics of lending to the private sector, while the growth of government credit stayed high. Meanwhile, the leu strengthened versus the euro due to an improved perception of foreign investors towards the Romanian economy amid the reactivation of the multilateral external financing arrangement with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions and an increase in global risk appetite. The monetary policy stance remained prudent, seeking to pro-actively ensure that broad real monetary conditions are appropriate for a convergence of inflation towards medium-term objectives as well as for the sustainable revival of lending in the Romanian economy. The outlook indicates the continuation of disinflation despite a temporary pick-up in inflation in January under the impact of the exogenous shock coming from excise duties on tobacco, as the favorable dynamics in the adjusted CORE2 inflation  which better reflects the impact of aggregate demand management  is set to continue. The persistence of uncertainties related to trends in the global economy, capital flows, administered prices and volatile prices are also worth mentioning. In this context, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 7.0 percent per annum from 7.5 percent. Consequently, starting February 4, 2010, the rate on the deposit facility will be lowered to 3.0 percent per annum from 3.5 percent and the rate on the lending facility (Lombard) will be 11.0 percent per annum versus 11.5 percent. At the same time, the penalty rate for deficits of leu-denominated minimum reserve requirements will drop to 16.5 percent starting with the February 24-March 23, 2010, maintenance period. The NBR Board has also decided to ensure an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu-denominated and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses evolutions in the recent macroeconomic environment and the inflation outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. Therefore the NBR Board reaffirms that a firm implementation of the economic policy mix  monetary, fiscal, income and structural reforms  agreed under the multilateral external financing arrangement are essential for further achieving sustainable disinflation, maintaining financial stability and restarting a lasting economic recovery. The NBR will continue to closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so that, by an appropriate and prompt use of its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. The quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for February 5, 2010, along with a 12-month calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues."

Euroarea,2010-02-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference today. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 14 January 2010, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that euro area economic activity continued to expand around the turn of the year. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010. The recovery process is likely to be uneven and the outlook remains subject to uncertainty. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest information confirms that economic activity in the euro area continued to expand around the turn of the year. The euro area has been benefiting from a turn in the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports, as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. However, these stimuli will unwind over time, while activity is likely to be adversely affected by the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors, both inside and outside the euro area. In addition, low capacity utilisation rates are likely to dampen investment, and unemployment in the euro area is expected to increase somewhat further, thereby lowering consumption growth. For these reasons, the euro area economy is expected to grow only at a moderate pace in 2010 and the recovery process could be uneven. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced. On the upside, confidence may improve more than expected, and both the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected. Furthermore, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation increased further in January 2010 to stand at 1.0%, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 0.9% in December 2009. Inflation is expected to be around 1% in the near term and to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. In line with a slow recovery in demand in the euro area and elsewhere, overall price, cost and wage developments are expected to stay subdued. In this context, it is important to emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. They relate, in particular, to the further development of economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 remained negative in December 2009, standing at -0.2%. In the same period, annual growth in loans to the private sector was zero. These data continue to support our assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. Actual monetary developments are likely to be weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion, owing to the downward impact of the rather steep yield curve. Looking ahead. M3 and credit growth is likely to remain weak for some time to come. The prevailing interest rate constellation continues to have a strong influence on both the level and composition of annual M3 growth. On the one hand, the low rates of remuneration on short-term bank deposits foster the allocation of funds away from M3 and into longer-term deposits and securities. On the other hand, the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different short-term deposits imply a low opportunity cost of holding funds in the most liquid components included in M1, which continued to grow at a robust annual rate of more than 12% in December. The zero annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector reflects a further increase in the growth in loans to households, while the annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations moved further into negative territory. Such divergence remains in line with business cycle regularities. The ongoing contraction in the outstanding amounts of loans to non-financial corporations continues to be accounted for entirely by a strong net redemption of loans with a short maturity. For the sector as a whole, the overall contraction may be due partly to substitution with market-based financing. Given the typical lags between turning points in economic activity and those in the demand for bank loans, growth in loans can be expected to remain weak over the months to come. In the meantime, the real cost of external financing for non-financial enterprises has declined further, while the net tightening of credit standards applied by banks has continued to diminish, as indicated by the Bank Lending Survey for the last quarter of 2009. At the same time, banks have continued to reduce the size of their overall balance sheets over the past few months. In this respect, the challenge remains for banks to adjust the size and structure of their balance sheets while ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector. To address this challenge, banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen their capital bases further and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. This is important to facilitate access to finance, especially for those enterprises that do not have recourse to market-based financing. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 14 January 2010, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that euro area economic activity continued to expand around the turn of the year. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010. The recovery process is likely to be uneven and the outlook remains subject to uncertainty. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. We will continue our enhanced credit support to the banking system, while taking into account the ongoing improvement in financial market conditions and avoiding distortions associated with maintaining non-standard measures for too long. The Governing Council will, in early March, take decisions on the continued implementation of the gradual phasing-out of the extraordinary liquidity measures that are not needed to the same extent as in the past. In order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term, the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, many euro area countries are faced with large, sharply rising fiscal imbalances, leading to less favourable medium and long-term interest rates and lower levels of private investment. Moreover, high levels of public deficit and debt place an additional burden on monetary policy and undermine the Stability and Growth Pact as a key pillar of Economic and Monetary Union. Against this background, it is of paramount importance that the stability programme of each euro area country clearly defines the fiscal exit and consolidation strategies for the period ahead. Countries will be required to meet their commitments under the excessive deficit procedures. Consolidation of public finances should start in 2011 at the latest and will have to exceed substantially the annual adjustment of 0.5% of GDP set as a minimum requirement by the Stability and Growth Pact. The key challenge in order to reinforce sustainable growth and job creation is to accelerate structural reforms, as the financial crisis has negatively affected the productive capacity of our economies. In the case of product markets, policies that enhance competition and innovation are urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create new business opportunities. In labour markets, moderate wage-setting, effective incentives to work and sufficient labour market flexibility are required in order to avoid significantly higher structural unemployment over the coming years. Finally, an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks' resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability."
Egypt,2010-02-04,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release February 4, 2010 In its meeting held on February 4, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 825 percent and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 85 percen. Headline CPI declined by 13 percent (m/m) in December 2009, to maintain the annual inflation rate broadly unchanged at 1324 percent compared to 1329 percent in November 200. For the second consecutive month, the negative monthly inflation rate was largely due to lower prices of fruits and vegetables which have been the key drivers of headline inflation since February 200. In the meantime, annual core inflation inched up to 685 percent in December compared to 659 percent in November on the back of the unfavorable base effects from last year and remains within the CBE's comfort zon. Meanwhile annual real GDP growth recorded 49 percent in 2009/10 Q1 compared to the four year low of 41 percent witnessed in 2008/09 Q2. While this outturn remains below the 7 percent average registered over the past three years, it reflects a steady improvement in economic activit. There are encouraging signs that the global slowdown has stabilized somewhat over recent months and the outlook for the international economy appears to have improved as wel. This coupled, with the domestic fiscal and monetary measures undertaken so far will continue to provide a conducive environment for the domestic econom. Against this background, the MPC assesses that inflationary pressures remain subdued and that the current level of policy interest rate is appropriate and supportive of the economic recovery while consistent with maintaining core inflation within the CBE's comfort zone in the medium-ter. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Division Chief.

Chile,2010-02-11,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 11 February 2010 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50% (annual). Internationally, the volatility of financial markets has increased due to turbulence in some European economies. The prices of copper and oil have dropped. Nevertheless, prospects for global economic recovery for 2010 have not changed. Domestically, available information suggests that output continues to expand, and demand is growing somewhat faster than forecast in December's Monetary Policy Report. The rate of unemployment has continued to decline. Lending conditions are normalizing. In January, the CPI showed an increase associated to specific items. The various core measures continue to post small variations. Medium-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The real exchange rate has increased. The Board estimates that the macroeconomic environment is consistent with a monetary policy interest rate that will be held at its minimum level of 0.50% at least until the second quarter of 2010. Accordingly, it reiterates that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected annual inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2010-02-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. Domestic economic activity has continued on a recovering trend, which is expected to be maintained. Exports and domestic demand have steadily increased and production has advanced briskly. There still, however, remains uncertainty as to the economic growth path due to the risk of government debt crises in some European countries. Consumer price inflation has accelerated its rising pace. It is anticipated as likely to be stable, however, in reflection of recent international raw material price movements. The upward trend of real estate prices has been blunted. Financial market price variables such as exchange rate and stock prices have shown high volatility under the influence of international financial market unrest. Mortgage lending has slowed due to the seasonal factors. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain the accommodative policy stance for the time being in such a way as to help sustain the trend of recovery in economic activity."
Peru,2010-02-11,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2010 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 1.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference interest rate at 1.25 percent. This decision has been made considering that the recent evolution of inflation does not show demand pressures, but rather the transitory impact of supply shocks. Inflation in January recorded a rate of 0.3 percent, due mainly to the increase of the prices of fuels and some foodstuffs. As a result, the rate of annual inflation went from 0.25 percent in December to 0.44 percent in January, below the lower band of the target range (1 percent). Advanced indicators of economic activity show clear signs of recovery of dynamism, but no signals of inflationary pressures in the short term. The Board keeps a close watch on inflation forecasts and inflation determinants and, if required, will adopt preventive adjustments in the monetary policy stance to guarantee that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 2.05 percent. Overnight deposits: 0.45 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for March on its session of March 11, 2010."
Turkiye,2010-02-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep policy rates unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 6.50 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 2.50 percent, lending rate at 12 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent. Recent data releases suggest that a moderate recovery in economic activity is ongoing. Domestic demand displays a gradual growth trend while there are still uncertainties regarding the external demand, suggesting that it will take a while before the capacity utilization rates return to pre-crisis levels. Although there has been a mild improvement in employment conditions, unemployment rates remain at high levels. Therefore, resource utilization is expected to stay at low levels for some time. The Committee has indicated that, due to impact of tax adjustments, unprocessed food price increases, and base effects, inflation would continue to rise significantly in February and hover above the target for some time. Core inflation indicators would also increase until mid-year, yet remain below the target throughout the year. In this respect, it has been emphasized that inflation would display a declining trend once the temporary factors taper off. Credit markets have continued to improve in response to the monetary easing. However, lingering problems across the global economy are not resolved completely and there are still uncertainties regarding the strength of the recovery. Accordingly, the Committee has reemphasized that it would be necessary to keep policy rates at low levels for a long period of time. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Hungary,2010-02-22,"At its meeting on 22 February 2010, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 25 basis points from 6.00% to 5.75%, with effect from 23 February 2010. The Monetary Council discussed the February 2010 issue of the Bank's Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian growth is likely to resume in the middle of 2010 as the economy recovers from the sharp downturn of 2009. Inflation is expected to remain elevated temporarily due to the increases in taxes and administered prices, and then to fall significantly in the second half of the year, before dipping below the Bank's 3% target in 2011. There remains considerable uncertainty about future conditions in global financial markets. Hungary's GDP continued to fall in 2009 Q4. However, the pace of decline moderated considerably, mainly reflecting a pick-up in exports in the wake of the recovery in external demand. By contrast, the contraction in domestic demand is continuing. In consequence, the recovery in Hungary is likely to lag behind that of developed economies and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The diverging trends in demand abroad and at home have led to a further improvement in Hungary's external balance, with the current account registering a substantial surplus since mid-2009. This uneven pattern may continue in the medium term. The Council therefore expects the economy to operate without reliance on foreign funding in coming years. The increase in CPI inflation in the past three months was attributable mainly to rises in the prices of items excluded from the core measure. Services price inflation declined to a historic low. Taking all these factors into account, the Monetary Council continues to judge that inflation may fall below the target over the next two years, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than earlier expected. Global investor sentiment weakened over the past month as concerns about the sustainability of the path of government debt in a number of developed economies again came to the fore. At the same time, assessments of risks associated with Hungarian financial assets barely changed. The significant improvement in Hungary's external balance has reduced the vulnerability of the economy; however, the high level of debt and weak indicators of economic activity continue to pose risks. In order to reduce the country's vulnerability to external shocks, it is particularly important to maintain a disciplined, long-term sustainable fiscal policy. Based on the above considerations, the Monetary Council has decided to reduce interest rates by 25 basis points. The Council judges that the room for manoeuvre in interest rate policy has narrowed, due to increased uncertainty in international financial markets. Even if justified by the outlook for inflation and the economy, interest rates may only be reduced further if changes in perceptions of risks associated with the economy allow it."
Israel,2010-02-22,"22.02.2010 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for March 2010 unchanged The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for March 2010 will be unchanged at 1.25 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The 0.7 percent decline in the CPI for January was lower than expected--the forecasts had predicted a decline of between 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent, and it followed a surprisingly low December index. The low January index was mainly due to price reductions resulting from government decisions, i.e., a reduction in VAT and the cancellation of the water surcharge, and also to the decline, for the second consecutive month, in the housing index. Excluding the effects of the government actions, the January CPI declined by 0.2 percent, slightly above the seasonal path consistent with the inflation target. In the last twelve months prices rose by 3.8 percent, and excluding the effects of government measures, 3.2 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation expectations forthe next twelve months derived from the capital market declined following the publication of the index for January, and currently stand at 2.4 percent. Forecasters' inflation expectations derived from the expectations of theindices of the next twelve months (February 2010 to January 2011) averaged 2.2 percent; the forecasters predict that inflation in 2010 will be 1.7 percent, and that in the next few months inflation measured over the previoustwelve months will return to within the target range. With regard to the Bank of Israel interest rate, expectations of forecasters and those derived from the capital market are that it will remain unchanged for March. The forecasters predict on average that in a year's time it will be 2.75 percent,and the capital market reflects the assessment that it will be 2.6 percent. Real economic activity: The positive trend in economic activity in Israel continued. National Accounts figures for the last quarter of 2009 show that GDP grew at an annual rate of 4.4 percent, with a similar increase in private consumption and notable expansion of goods and services exports. Fixed investment, however, dropped by 9.4 percent, and nonresidential investment by 15 percent. The Bank of Israel composite state-of-the-economy index rose by 0.2 percent in January, and the rises in the December and November indices were both adjusted downwards from 0.4 percent to 0.3 percent. The rise in the January index was due to increases in manufacturing production and trade and services revenue. Currently. Israel's growth is being powered by private consumption and by exports,so that its rate and its stability depend to a great degree also on the strength of global growth. The labor market and wages: According to National Insurance Institute (NII) data, the number of Israeli employee posts remained unchanged inNovember, after increasing in each of the preceding three months. The trend data, however, show that the increase in the number of employee posts that started in June 2009 continued in November. NII data on the wage per employee post in September-November show a 0.7 percent increase in the nominal wage, meaning a 2.5 percent decline, year on year, in the real wage. Health tax revenues in December indicate that the positive trend in totalwage payments that started in July 2009 continued. Budget data: The domestic budget surplus in January, excluding credit, was NIS 4 billion, compared with a surplus of NIS 1.4 billion in January 2009. The surplus this month is NIS 2.8 billion higher than the seasonal surplus consistent with meeting the budget deficit ceiling of 5.5 percent of GDP. The deviation from the seasonal path reflects the continued acceleration in tax revenues. Thus the positive trend in the budget deficit trend that started in November is continuing. That said, the surplus is still low compared with those in the years from 2005 to 2008. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the previous monetary policy discussions of January 24 and February 21, the shekel depreciated by 0.9 percent against the dollar, and appreciated by 3.7 percent against the euro, against the background of the dollar's recent strengthening against the euro. In terms of the index of the nominal effective exchange rate vis-?-vis the currencies of Israel's trading partners (weighted by the volume of trade), the shekel appreciated by 1.26 percent between January 24 and February 18. The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of January 24 and February 21, the Tel Aviv 25 index rose by 3.9 percent, and the Tel Aviv 100 index by 3.6 percent. This was similar to the trend in the major stock exchanges. Government bonds showed a positive trend, in contrast to the trends in most emerging market countries. Over the month, yields on unindexed 10-year shekel bonds fell by 4 basis points (b.p.), and yields on 10-year indexed bonds fell by about 2 b.p. As yields on 10-year US government bonds increased by about 18.5 b.p., to 3.77 percent, the yield gap between Israeli and US unindexed government bonds contracted significantly, to about 120 b.p. The yield to maturity on twelve-month makam was stable at about 1.9 percent. The positive trend in the Tel-Bond indices persisted, with the Tel-Bond 20 index rising by 0.8 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 2.3 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, held steady at 1.24 percent, in contrast to steep increases in CDS spreads of most emerging and advanced economies. The money supply: The M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) decreased by 2.3 percent in January, following itsdecline of 0.4 percent in December. The M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits up to one year) increased by 0.3 percent in January, after increasing by 0.5 percent in December. The world economy: The global economy continued its recovery fromthe crisis, as could be seen from the positive growth figures of the US and China for the last quarter of 2009. The IMF revised its global growth forecasts upwards. In light of weak employment figures in the G 3 countries, however, there remains the risk of another recession, whose probability may even have increased. The debt problems in some European countries and concern over the possibility of another recession led to a situation in which themarkets indicate assessments that the transition to a tighter monetary policy will be delayed in some countries, and expectations of increases in theinterest rates of the major central banks have been pushed back. Nevertheless, the Fed approved the increase of the discount window rate from 1/2 percent to 3/4 percent, another step in the process that started a few months ago of reducing and ending the Fed's various support programs. In its announcement of the increase, the Fed explained that this did not signal any change in monetary policy, and that the federal funds reserve rate was likely to remain exceptionally low for an extended period. Inflation in the advanced economies continues to be low, against the background of large output gap in the global economy. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for March unchanged at 1.25 percent is part of the gradual process of returning interest to a more normal level; the process is intended to return inflation to within the target range and to contribute to the further recovery of economic activity, while supporting financial stability. The path of the interest rate will be determined in accordance with the inflation environment, the entrenchment of growth, both global and in Israel, the rate at which the major central banks increase their interest rates, and in light of developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. The January CPI was the second successive surprisingly low index, with the two indices cumulatively more than half a percentage point lower than expected. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months calculated from the capital market, and forecasters' twelve-month inflation expectations are within the target inflation range, at 2.4 percent and 2.2 percent respectively. The assessments are that in the next few months, inflation measured over the previous twelve months will come back into the target range, in part reflecting the effect of the recent appreciation of the shekel, the reduction in VAT and the cancellation of the water surcharge. Recent economic activity is continuing to develop positively. Various risk factors, however, still cast a shadow over the positive global growth trends. Interest rates of the leading central banks around the world are very low, and are expected to remain so during the coming months. Nonetheless, some leading central banks are reducing their use of special instruments of monetary accommodation. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic and financial developments, and will use the instruments available to itto achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on 8 March 2010. The decision regarding the interest rate for April 2010 will be published at 17:30 on Sunday, 28 March 2010 (instead of the scheduled Monday 29 March, because of the Passover holiday). 22.02.2010 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for March 2010 unchanged. The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for March 2010 unchanged. The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for March 2010 will be unchanged at 1.25 percent. Background conditions.

Poland,2010-02-24,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 24 February 2010 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 23-24 February 2010 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate at 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) discount rate at 4.00% on an annual basis. Released data point to a further increase in economic activity in the United States and a slow improvement in economic conditions in the euro area. However, the labour market situation in the developed economies remains unfavourable, which is in line with expectations. Moreover, lending continues to shrink, though the difference between the share of banks tightening and those loosening their credit policies in the euro area has narrowed. At the same time, the largest emerging economies, including China, see their GDP growth accelerate. The recovery in economic activity around the world is still being supported by strongly expansionary macroeconomic policies based on both conventional and non-standard instruments. In the recent period, the risk aversion in international financial markets has risen, which was largely related to fears about the effects of the fiscal problems in some of the euro-area economies. The rise in risk aversion contributed to declines in prices of some financial assets. At the same time, oil prices remained highly volatile. Inflation increase in emerging market economies was accompanied with a slight rise in inflation in some of the developed economies. Preliminary GUS data on GDP in 2009 imply that 2009 Q4 saw further recovery of economic growth. The newest monthly data on the Polish economy also point to improved economic activity. Some stabilisation of employment in the enterprise sector may signal a gradual deceleration of the unfavourable labour market tendencies, though unemployment rate is still rising, which is largely driven by increasing labour force participation. The growth in loans to the non-financial sector remains low, though banks envisage higher lending to this sector in the coming period. According to GUS preliminary data, in January 2010 annual CPI inflation rose to 3.6%, i.e. slightly above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target of 2.5%. The rise in the annual inflation rate was primarily driven by higher annual rate of fuel prices, largely due to a positive base effect. The Council got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute of the NBP, which is one of the inputs into the Council's decision-making on the NBP interest rates. In line with the February projection  under the assumption of constant NBP interest rates  there is a 50-percent probability that inflation will remain within the range of 1.32.2% in ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, 2010 (compared to 0.82.2% in the October projection), 1.73.1% in 2011 (compared to 1.13.2%) and 2.64.6% in 2012. According to the February projection, there is a 50-percent probability that the annual GDP growth will remain within the range of 2.14.1% in 2010 (compared to 0.82.8% in the October projection), 1.84.0% in 2011 (compared to 2.24.2%) and 1.94.3% in 2012. In line with available forecasts, in the months to come the annual CPI will be lowered by negative base effects connected with the surge in administered prices and food prices at the beginning of 2009. Other factors conducive to lower inflation include: low demand pressure, previously observed moderate growth of labour costs and the hitherto observed zloty appreciation. In turn, inflation decline in 2010 may be curbed by rises in: commodity prices in the world markets, fees subject to local governments' decisions and administered prices. In the Council's assessment the probabilities of inflation running below or above the inflation target in the medium term to be balanced. In the Council's view, the improvement in global economic activity and the previously implemented monetary policy easing support the return of the economy to the potential growth path. The impact of the hitherto pursued expansionary macroeconomic policies abroad and their prospective reversal are an important source of uncertainty for future economic growth and inflation in the world economy and, consequently, also for the domestic monetary policy. An important factor affecting monetary policy is the situation of the public finance sector. Introducing measures aimed at permanently reducing the deficit of the general government sector and at curbing the increase of the public debt will support macroeconomic stability and allow to meet the criteria for euro adoption. The Council expresses the opinion that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organisational conditions. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  February 2010."
Nigeria,2010-03-01,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 68 of the 213th Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. March 1-2, 2010 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 1st and 2nd March, 2010 to review domestic economic conditions for the first two months of 2010 and the challenges faced by the Nigerian economy against the backdrop of developments in the international economic and financial environments in order to chart the course for monetary and financial sector policies for the remainder of the year. On the international economic scene, the Committee noted that the rebound in global economic activity which started in the second half of 2009 has continued. The rebound was driven largely by the unprecedented amount of fiscal stimuli undertaken in both the developed and emerging market economies in the wake of the global financial crises. As a consequence, monetary policy had been largely accommodative with interest rates down to record lows in most advanced and emerging markets, coupled with the considerable expansion of central bank balance sheets. The key concerns, however, remain the strength and sustainability of the recovery process which is proceeding at varying speeds across the different regions. In the advanced economies, the recovery is still expected to be weak by historical standards, with real output projected to remain below its pre-crisis level until late 2011. Given their stronger initial economic conditions and swift policy responses, growth in the emerging and developing economies is expected to recover faster. The Committee also noted the continuing rebound in commodity prices, particularly crude oil prices, which is helping to support growth in commodity producing regions. However the inflation risk of the rebound in energy prices appears to be mitigated by the subsisting low levels of capacity utilization, weak private demand and well-anchored inflation expectations. The MPC also observed that although financial markets have recovered remarkably faster than expected, financing conditions, especially for businesses and firms, are likely to remain difficult in the near-term as financial institutions continue to maintain a cautious approach to credit extension. Bank lending is likely to remain sluggish given the need to rebuild capital, maintain liquidity and the possibility of further credit write- downs, mostly related to non-performing exposures to commercial real estates and stock markets. The Committee further noted that although the bond markets have rebounded, the households, small and medium-size enterprises that have only limited access to capital markets, are likely worldwide to continue to face credit constraints, except where public lending programmes and government guarantees are in place. As investors increasingly differentiate across countries with the resumption in capital flows, the risk of sovereign debt default has been heightened in some countries with large government deficits and debts. On the domestic scene, the MPC underscored the need for co-operation in fast-tracking on-going reform efforts in the banking sector to ensure the flow of credit to the real sector of the economy, aimed at supporting growth in the medium term. It also underlined the need for energizing reforms in critical 2 sectors of the economy such as power and other economic infrastructure, to attract the much-needed private sector/foreign investment and, thereby promote employment-generating growth. Key Domestic Macroeconomic and Financial Developments Output and Prices: Provisional data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicates that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will grow by 668 percent in the first quarter of 2010, down from 823 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2009, but up from the 450 per cent recorded in the first quarter of 2009. Overall GDP growth for 2010 was projected at 753 per cent which is higher than the 690 per cent recorded in 2009. The non-oil sector, especially, agriculture, wholesale and retail trade, and services would remain the major driver of growth although this is likely to be complemented by a modest increase in the growth of the oil sector GDP following the sustained peace in the Niger Delta region. While noting the optimistic growth projections for the year, the Committee observed that the robust growth projections was predicated on the assumption that the reforms that have been initiated in certain key sectors of the economy would be carried through. It therefore, urged strong commitment and political will on the part of the authorities to see these reforms through. The headline inflation rate, as measured by the year-on-year increase in the all item consumer price index, was 123 per cent in January 2010, up from 120 per cent in December 2009, but lower than the 124 per cent recorded in November 2009 and the 140 per cent recorded in January 2009. Food inflation, which hovered between 135 and 136 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2009, rose to 140 per cent in the January 2010. Inflation outlook for 3 2010 remains uncertain, due to a combination of both domestic and international economic developments, namely, the planned full deregulation of petroleum product prices, the expansionary fiscal outlay for 2010, and the rising international commodity prices. The Committee, however, noted that against the backdrop of weak aggregate demand as mirrored in the contraction in monetary aggregates since the beginning of 2009, the inflation risk to growth appears mitigated. The Committee will continue to monitor price developments in the months ahead with a view to creating an enabling environment for sustainable growth and employment. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments: Over the preceding December level, broad money (M2) declined by 311 per cent in January 2010, which was significantly below the indicative benchmark of 2926 per cent growth for 2010. Similarly the annualized decline in aggregate domestic credit (net) as at January 2010 was 2244 per cent, compared with the provisional benchmark growth rate of 828 per cent for 2010. As in most periods of 2009, reserve money continued to be below the indicative benchmark for the first quarter of 2010 in the first two months of 2010. The annualized growth rate of private sector credit was -1620 per cent, significantly below the provisional benchmark of 3154 per cent, indicating that the private sector particularly, small and medium enterprises, were being starved of the much-needed credit. Banks lost about 66 per cent of their capital between December 2008 and December 2009 which has constrained the ability of the banks to grow credit. This underscores the need for Asset Management Corporation (AMC) to deal with non- performing loans and fast-track recapitalization of the institutions to enable them continue to grow their loan books. The trends in money supply 4 reflected a fall in all its components, including net foreign assets, credit to the private sector and credit to government. This development is a reflection of the slack in aggregate demand, underlining the need for the sustenance of the easing of monetary policy. Notwithstanding the sub-optimal performance of monetary aggregates thus far, confidence in the money market has continued to improve following the inter-bank money market guarantee and other measures to strengthen the banking sector. This is reflected in the downward movement of the daily interbank call rates. Specifically the average call rate for January 2010 was 231 per cent, down from 289 per cent at end-December 2009 and 525 per cent in November. The secured open buy-back (OBB) rate for January 2010 was 230 per cent down from 264 per cent at end-December 2009 and 453 per cent in November. As at February 25, 2010, the interbank call and OBB rates were 221 and 207 per cent, respectively. Thus the rates appear to be converging, reflecting a restoration of confidence in the money market and favorable liquidity position in the banking system. However this liquidity position of banks against the backdrop of declining private sector credit implies that the banks are reluctant to lend to the real economy. Thus the focus of policy measures would be to ensure the flow of credit to the real economy by supporting targeted lending programmes. In this regard, the Committee maintained its earlier position that despite falling interbank rates and growing banking system liquidity, the retail lending rates of deposit money banks (DMBs) were still very high. This is despite the marginal decline in the average maximum lending rate to 2318 per cent in January 2010 from 2345 and 231 per cent in December and 5 November, 2009, respectively. The average prime lending rate also fell to 1838 per cent in January 2010 from 1903 and 1893 per cent in December and November 2009, respectively. The Committee reaffirmed that the reduction of structural and institutional impediments. DMBs risk perception of borrowers, as well as use of shared infrastructure by banks and the development of alternative funding sources for firms, could moderate the high lending rates. The Committee welcomed the efforts made thus far, on these issues, particularly the request to accord liquidity status to State Government bonds, the proposal for tax waivers on fixed income securities, the proposed national credit guarantee scheme for small and medium-scale enterprises, and on-lending programmes through the Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), such as the Bank of Industry. It urged their intensification for eventual actualization. The Nigerian capital market is showing some signs of recovery compared to the last quarter of 2009. Market Capitalization (MC) also rose by 114 per cent, from N498 trillion at end-December 2009 to N554 trillion on 25th February, 2010. The NSE has attributed the improved performance of the stock market to share price increases in the Banking. Food and Beverages, and Oil and Gas sectors. However the major stock markets around the world showed deteriorating performance over the period, following calls for increased regulation in the US and Europe, deteriorating government finances in Europe and poor unemployment reports in some advanced economies. External Sector Developments: The foreign exchange market remained relatively stable in the first two months of 2010. In January 2010, the WDAS average exchange rate stood at N14978 per US dollar, the same rate recorded in December 2009. As at 24th February 2010, the WDAS exchange rate had depreciated to N15010. The inter-bank market rate averaged N15033/US$ in January, 2010. Thus the spread between the WDAS and inter-bank market rates remains insignificant. The convergence reflected the continued confidence and clarity in expectation, engendered by the exchange rate stability. Policy will continue to focus on avoiding volatility in exchange rates and strengthening confidence in the market. External reserves stood at US$4154 billion on 24th February 2010, down by US$051 billion or 121 per cent from the level of US$4205 billion recorded in the preceding month. Overall the net outflow of foreign exchange which moderated significantly from US$93193 million to US$13837 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2009 turned to a net inflow of US$010 billion in January 2010. The Committee was satisfied with this development, noting that the level of reserves remained robust and buoyant enough to support the country’s external transactions in the near-term. It however, believed that if the rising price of crude oil in the international market in recent months is sustained, coupled with improvement in output with peace in the Niger Delta, there is likely to be an improvement in the level of foreign exchange reserves. The Committee’s Considerations The Committee noted the potential for inflationary pressure in the near-to- medium term, but observed that recent experience shows that inflation has 7 been driven largely by structural factors particularly the bottleneck experienced in the supply of petroleum products in the wake of the announcement of the full deregulation of the downstream petroleum industry. It noted that growth in both monetary and credit aggregates has remained weak since the beginning of 2009, and therefore any attempt at this time to tighten monetary policy will exacerbate the problem and further constrain credit availability to the real economy. The MPC further stressed the need to unlock the credit market. Members also observed that there is sufficient liquidity in the money market as suggested by the low interbank interest rates, but that the perception of credit risk on the part of the DMBs remained a major constraint to their ability to lend to the real sector of the economy. In this regard, the Committee felt that a broader macroeconomic policy framework will be needed to unlock the credit market. In this context, the MPC recognised the need to encourage the DMBs to channel the excess funds deposited with the CBN under the standing deposit facility to the real sector. It therefore considered the review of the setting of the standing facility corridor as imperative, to encourage banks to lend to the productive sectors of the economy. As part of the efforts to bring lending rates down, provide alternative sources of long-term funds to finance development projects and deepen the capital market in line with the CBN’s developmental mandate, the MPC, deliberated on the possibility of granting liquidity status to bonds issued by 8 state governments that meet certain eligibility criteria, including the Investment and Securities Act 2007 (ISA) and DMO requirements. Decisions In the light of the above, the Committee unanimously took the following decisions: 1. MPR remains unchanged at 60 per cent; 2. Standing Lending Facility interest rate remains unchanged at 800 per cent, while the Standing Deposit Facility rate is lowered from 20 per cent to 10 per cent; 3. Granted liquidity status to bonds issued by state governments, subject to their meeting the specified eligibility criteria. Detailed guidelines will be issued in due course, principally related to meeting strict standards of fiscal responsibility; and 4. To continue with the quantitative easing policy by providing N500 billion facility for investment in debentures issued by the Bank of Industry (BOI) in accordance with Section 31 of the CBN Act 2007, for investment in emergency power projects dedicated to industrial clusters. The funds are to be channeled through the Bank of Industry for on-lending to the DMBs at a maximum interest rate of 10 per cent for disbursement of loans with a tenor of 10 – 15 years at concessionary interest rate of not more than 70 per cent. The Committee also approved in principle the extension of this facility to DMBs for the purpose of refinancing/ restructuring existing portfolios to manufacturers. However the final approval for this will come after the consideration of the report of a technical committee to be set up to work out the modalities, for implementation within one month. Membership of the committee comprises the CBN, the Bankers’ Committee Sub-committee on Economic Development. Bank of Industry. Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), and National Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (NASME). The African Finance Corporation (AFC) will serve as technical adviser on the power project. In the case of the power projects, the following projects of the Federal Government will be covered under this facility subject to their being restructured into commercially viable projects on which banks are willing to take credit risks: Lagos (500 MW); Kano (250 MW); Onitsha/Nnewi (200 MW); Port Harcourt/Aba (200MW); Kaduna (225 MW); Funtua/Gusua/MFashi/Zaria (200 MW); Lokoja (200MW); and Maiduguri/Gombe/Bauchi (200 MW). Other power projects currently being financed by banks may also be refinanced from the fund. However banks will be required to secure the funds drawn with eligible securities. In addition, real sector projects certified bankable that emanate from the State Governors’ engagement with the Bankers’ Committee in line with the outcome of the Enugu Retreat will be accommodated under the facility.

Euroarea,2010-03-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 February 2010, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area is on track, although it is likely to remain uneven. Overall, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, in an environment marked by continued uncertainty. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressures over the medium term. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At today's meeting we also discussed, in view of economic and financial market developments, how to proceed with the gradual phasing-out of our non-standard operational measures. In this respect, we decided to continue conducting both the main refinancing operations (MROs) and the special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary  and at least until the end of this year's ninth maintenance period on 12 October 2010. In the case of the special-term refinancing operations, the fixed rate will be the same as the rate used in the respective MRO. The Governing Council also decided to return to variable rate tender procedures in the regular three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs), starting with the operation to be allotted on 28 April 2010. Allotment amounts in these operations will be set with the aim of ensuring smooth conditions in money markets and avoiding any significant spreads between bid rates and the prevailing MRO rate. Furthermore, the Governing Council decided, in line with its decision on the 12-month LTRO of 16 December 2009, to fix the rate in the six-month LTRO to be allotted on 31 March 2010 at the average minimum bid rate of the MROs over the life of this operation. With today's decisions, the Eurosystem continues to provide liquidity support to the banking system of the euro area at very favourable conditions, thereby facilitating the provision of credit to the euro area. At the same time, these decisions help to avoid distortions associated with maintaining non-standard measures for longer than needed. The Governing Council will continue to implement the gradual phasing-out of the extraordinary liquidity measures. In order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term, the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Over recent quarters, the euro area has continued to benefit from the significant macroeconomic stimulus provided and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the banking system, as well as from the ongoing recovery in the world economy. According to Eurostat's first release, in quarter-on-quarter terms euro area real GDP increased by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009, after growing by 0.4% in the third quarter. Available indicators suggest that the economic recovery in the euro area is on track, although it is likely to remain uneven. In particular, a number of special factors are at play, including adverse weather conditions in parts of the euro area in the first quarter of 2010. Given this uneven pattern, it is more appropriate to look through the quarterly volatility and to compare growth developments on a half-yearly basis. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects real GDP growth to remain moderate in 2010, owing to the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and the expectation that the low capacity utilisation is likely to dampen investment and that consumption is being dampened by weak labour market prospects. This assessment is also reflected in the March 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between 0.4% and 1.2% for 2010 and between 0.5% and 2.5% for 2011. Compared with the Eurosystem staff projections published in December 2009, the range for real GDP growth in 2010 is slightly narrower, while for 2011 the range has been revised slightly upwards, reflecting notably stronger activity worldwide. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced, in an environment marked by continued uncertainty. On the upside, confidence may improve more than expected, and both the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected. Furthermore, there may be larger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and renewed tensions in some financial market segments, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.9% in February 2010, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 1.0% in January. Inflation is expected to be around 1% in the near term and to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. In line with a slow recovery in domestic and foreign demand, overall price, cost and wage developments are expected to stay subdued. In this context, it is important to emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This assessment is also reflected in the March 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 0.8% and 1.6% for 2010 and between 0.9% and 2.1% for 2011. Compared with the Eurosystem staff projections published in December 2009, the range for 2010 has been adjusted marginally downwards, while the range for 2011 has been adjusted slightly upwards. They relate, in particular, to further developments in economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 turned slightly positive in January 2010, rising to 0.1%. This reflects mainly a base effect and confirms the assessment of continued weak monetary growth. Together with the negative annual rate of growth in loans to the private sector (equal to -0.6% in January 2010), the latest data support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that, in the medium term, the inflationary pressures associated with monetary developments are low. The growth of M3 and loans to the private sector is likely to remain weak also in the coming months. At the same time, actual monetary developments are likely to be weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion, on account of the downward impact of the steep yield curve. This fosters the allocation of funds away from M3 and into longer-term deposits and securities. On the other hand, the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different M3 instruments imply a low opportunity cost of holding funds in the most liquid components included in M1, which continued to grow at a robust annual rate of 11.5% in January. The negative annual growth of loans to the private sector conceals ongoing opposite developments: positive, strengthening annual growth in loans to households on the one hand and negative, declining annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations on the other hand. Such differences are consistent with historical patterns and cyclical regularities, which suggest that loans to non-financial corporations can be expected to remain weak for some time after economic activity has picked up. At the same time, the cost of financing for enterprises has declined and the sector as a whole has continued to make extensive use of market-based financing as a substitute for bank financing. Banks have continued to reduce the size of their overall balance sheets over the past few months, but the challenge remains for them to manage this adjustment while ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector. To address this challenge, banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen their capital bases further and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 February 2010, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area is on track, although it is likely to remain uneven. Overall, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, in an environment marked by continued uncertainty. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressures over the medium term. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. As regards fiscal policies, high levels of public deficit and debt place an additional burden on monetary policy and undermine the Stability and Growth Pact as a key pillar of Economic and Monetary Union. It is of paramount importance that the stability programme of each euro area country clearly defines the fiscal exit and consolidation strategies for the period ahead. This requires determined efforts, notably on the side of countries with high deficit and debt levels. All countries will be required to meet their commitments under the excessive deficit procedures. Consolidation of public finances should start in 2011 at the latest and will have to exceed substantially the annual adjustment of 0.5% of GDP set as a minimum requirement by the Stability and Growth Pact. The Governing Council issued, on 3 March 2010, a statement on the additional fiscal consolidation measures announced by the Greek government. In all euro area countries, the key challenge in order to reinforce sustainable growth and job creation is to accelerate structural reforms. Policies should be adopted which open up market access and increase competition. Overall, it is essential to set the stage for long-term investment in innovation so as to create new business opportunities. Sectoral support schemes implemented to cope with the immediate effects of the crisis should now be phased out. In labour markets, moderate wage setting in several economies and sufficient labour market flexibility are required in order to avoid higher structural unemployment over the coming years. These structural reforms should be supported by an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks' resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability."
Malaysia,2010-03-04,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to raise the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) to 2.25 percent. The floor and ceiling rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly raised to 2 percent and 2.50 percent respectively. The recovery in the global economy is progressing amidst continued policy support and improvements in financial conditions. Economic activity in the advanced economies has improved although growth is expected to remain modest. Emerging economies, however, are recording a stronger recovery. In particular, regional economies expanded strongly in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the growth momentum is expected to be sustained. In the domestic economy, the stronger growth performance in the fourth quarter of 2009 affirms that the economic recovery is firmly established. Going forward, growth is expected to strengthen further, supported by domestic demand and continued improvement in external demand, particularly from the regional economies. Prices will gradually increase during the year, reflecting the prevailing economic conditions and taking into account possible adjustments in administered prices. While external factors, including rising global commodity and food prices, may exert some additional upward pressure on domestic prices, inflation is expected to remain moderate in 2010. The OPR was reduced to historic lows in early 2009 as a key measure to avert a severe and fundamental economic downturn. These conditions no longer prevail. The domestic economy has since improved significantly and is now on a path of recovery. Given this improved economic outlook, the MPC decided to adjust the OPR towards normalising monetary conditions and preventing the risk of financial imbalances that could undermine the economic recovery process. At the new level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy continues to remain accommodative and supportive of economic growth. Bank Negara Malaysia 04 March 2010."
Philippines,2010-03-10,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates steady at 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. The broad contours of the economy support the Monetary Board's assessment that current policy interest rate settings remain appropriate. The inflation outlook remains manageable, with the latest BSP baseline projections indicating within-target inflation in 2010 and 2011 as demand-side pressures remain modest and inflation expectations well-contained. Meanwhile, the current movements of asset prices, particularly in the equities and property markets, do not appear to pose any significant short-term challenges to the economy. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that a broad range of indicators point to increasing momentum in domestic economic activity. Latest export numbers have been quite strong, and export growth is likely to gain more traction as the global economic outlook improves. While the recent pick-up in inflation has emanated largely from the supply side, conditions warrant a closer monitoring of upside risks—which include the food supply impact of the El Niño weather phenomenon, power supply concerns, possible demands for wage adjustments and global commodity price increases—as these could lead to a build-up in inflationary pressures and inflation expectations. The Monetary Board will act decisively and adjust monetary policy settings accordingly if and when the second-round effects of supply shocks become evident. Given ample liquidity and the continued stability of financial markets, the Monetary Board also decided to phase out liquidity-enhancing crisis response measures, effective 15 March 2010. In particular, the Board decided to reduce the peso rediscounting budget from P60 billion to P40 billion. It also agreed to restore the loan value of all eligible rediscounting papers from 90 percent to 80 percent of the borrowing bank's credit instrument, as well as bring back the non-performing loan ratio requirement of two percentage points (from ten percentage points) above the latest available industry average NPL for banks wishing to avail of the rediscounting facility."
Thailand,2010-03-10,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 10 March 2010 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Assistant Governor. Bank of Thailand, announces the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, as follows. The global economic outlook has improved compared to the last MPC meeting, as reflected by upward revisions in growth forecasts. As a result, some countries have begun to normalize their monetary policy stances. However the MPC views that several risk factors remain, such as high unemployment and sovereign debt problems in some countries, that could hamper the sustainability of economic recovery going forward. The Thai economy expanded at a faster pace than market expectations in the fourth quarter of last year. Latest indicators also confirm that the expansion continued into January and has become more broad-based. Exports and tourism improve, while private consumption is now close to the pre-crisis level. Among key supporting factors are higher farm income and consumer confidence, as well as continued impetus from fiscal policy. The MPC views that downside risks to growth have declined from the last meeting. Inflation over the past three months has picked up pace, with latest headline inflation in February at 37 per cent owing to energy and fresh food components, while core inflation remains low. The MPC expects core inflation to rise in the periods ahead in line with economic expansion. The MPC views that the lower downside risk to growth has significantly lessened the need for an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy stance at present. However given uncertainties surrounding the sustainability of global economic recovery as well as domestic risk factors that could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence, the MPC has decided to maintain the policy interest rate at 125 per cent per annum, and will consider adjusting the policy interest rate to more normal levels in the periods ahead."
South Korea,2010-03-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. Domestic economic activity has continued on a recovering trend, which is expected to be maintained. Exports have risen and domestic demand has steadily increased. There still, however, remains uncertainty as to the economic growth path due to the problems of excessive government debt in some countries. Consumer price inflation has decelerated somewhat. It is anticipated to be stable for some time given the recent movements of international raw material prices. In the real estate market, transactions have remained inactive even though prices have risen moderately. In the financial markets, stock prices have rebounded and the Korean won has appreciated in line with alleviation of international financial market unrest, such as the government debt crises in some european countries. Mortgage lending has increased slightly due to seasonal factors. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain the accommodative policy stance for the time being in such a way as to help sustain the trend of recovery in economic activity."
Peru,2010-03-11,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2010 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 1.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference interest rate at 1.25 percent. This decision has been made considering that the recent evolution of inflation does not show demand pressures, but rather the transitory impact of supply shocks. Inflation in February recorded a rate of 0.3 percent, due mainly to the increase of the prices of some foodstuffs and readjustment of electric rates. As a result, the rate of annual inflation went from 0.44 percent in January to 0.84 percent in February, below the lower band of the target range (1 percent). Advanced indicators of economic activity show clear signs of recovery of dynamism, but no signals of inflationary pressures in the short term. The Board keeps a close watch on inflation forecasts and inflation determinants and, if required, will adopt preventive adjustments in the monetary policy stance to guarantee that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 2.05 percent. Overnight deposits: 0.45 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for March on its session of April 8, 2010."
United States,2010-03-16,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market is stabilizing. Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly. However, investment in nonresidential structures is declining, housing starts have been flat at a depressed level, and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth. Although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for a time, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability. With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve has been purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt; those purchases are nearing completion, and the remaining transactions will be executed by the end of this month. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability. In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve has been closing the special liquidity facilities that it created to support markets during the crisis. The only remaining such program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, is scheduled to close on June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and on March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A Duke; Donald L Kohn; Sandra Pianalto; Eric S Rosengren; Daniel K Tarullo; and Kevin M Warsh. Voting against the policy action was Thomas M Hoenig, who believed that continuing to express the expectation of exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period was no longer warranted because it could lead to the buildup of financial imbalances and increase risks to longer-run macroeconomic and financial stability."
Georgia,2010-03-17,"17.03.10 The NBG Keeps its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) unchanged at 5 Percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on March 17, 2010 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 5 percent. Several positive trends have been observed in February: money transfer inflows increased by annual 17.9 percent and preliminary data of trade statistics has shown significant increase in export volume. The volume of FDI comprised USD 759.1 mil. in 2009 and is expected to increase even more this year based on the current trends. CPI has increased in February 2010 by 1.5% mainly due to the seasonal factors. The Annual rate of inflation stands at 5.6 percent. However, the inflation forecast has not changed much after the committee's last meeting. Inflation is expected to remain around 6 percent mark in the medium term. The unemployment rate has increased insignificantly on an annual basis and stands at 16.3% Credit to the real economy has followed an increasing trend over the last two months and the growth rates of broad money aggregates have also increased significantly stimulating the aggregate demand and providing a basis for this year's expectations of economic growth. In order to enhance domestic currency denominated lending and contribute to the development of the money market the NBG is planning to introduce new instruments in the next few weeks. Namely, the NBG will enact standing facilities, overnight credits and overnight deposits, aimed at reducing the volatility of the interbank money market rate. The NBG also plans to widen the eligible collateral base for refinancing loans. These instruments will make lending in Lari more attractive for the banks than lending in FX, thus creating incentives for the reduction of credit risk for the economy as a whole. The National Bank of Georgia will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on April 14, 2010."
Chile,2010-03-18,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 18 March 2010 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50% (annual). Up to the earthquake and tsunami of 27th February, the local outlook suggested a narrowing of the output gap and stronger demand and output than had been assumed in the latest Monetary Policy Report. This was confirmed with the publication of the National Accounts for the year 2009. In February, the CPI posted an increase that was consistent with private expectations, while core inflation showed higher figures than in the previous months. Internationally, financial markets' volatility has dropped, commodity prices have shown significant increases, and prospects for global economic recovery for 2010 have not changed. The earthquake and tsunami have macroeconomic consequences. The immediate disruptive effects of the catastrophe can be expected to result in reduced economic activity and higher inflation in the very short term. Into the medium term, the macroeconomic scenario will be determined by the evolution of productive capacity, and by the magnitude, timing and financing of the reconstruction efforts. Any quantification of these aspects is still premature. The Board considers that, in the present circumstances—marked especially by the uncertainty associated with the effects of the catastrophe—, holding the monetary policy interest rate at its minimum level of 0.50% at least until the second quarter of 2010 is consistent with projected annual inflation standing at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2010-03-18,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release March 18, 2010 In its meeting held on March 18, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 825 percent and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 85 percen. Annual headline CPI declined to 1278 percent in February compared to 1363 percent registered in January 2010, yet remains elevated reflecting the impact of last year's unfavorable shock related to fruits and vegetable. In the meantime, annual core CPI registered 69 percent in February down from the 739 percent in January and remains within the CBE's comfort zon. Meanwhile annual real GDP growth recorded 5 percent in 2009/10 Q2 compared to the four year low of 41 percent witnessed in 2008/09 Q2, reflecting a steady improvement in economic activit. Furthermore the ongoing recovery in the global economy coupled with the domestic fiscal and monetary measures undertaken so far will continue to provide a conducive environment for the domestic econom. Against this background, the MPC assesses that inflationary pressures remain subdued and that the current level of policy interest rate is appropriate and supportive of the economic recovery while consistent with maintaining core inflation within the CBE's comfort zone in the medium-ter. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Turkiye,2010-03-18,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep policy rates unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 6.50 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 2.50 percent, lending rate at 12 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent. Recent data releases suggest that a moderate recovery in economic activity is ongoing. Domestic demand displays a gradual growth trend while there are still uncertainties regarding the external demand, suggesting that it will take a while before the industry capacity utilization rates return to pre-crisis levels. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates remain at high levels. The Committee has noted that inflation would drop to single digits in March, yet hover significantly above the target for sometime. It would then revert back to a downward trend as the temporary factors taper off starting with the last quarter of the year, and decline to levels consistent with inflation targets by early 2011. Core inflation indicators would increase in the short term, especially in March and April, due to temporary tax cuts of the previous year, but would remain at levels below the target. Credit markets have continued to improve in response to the monetary easing. However, despite recent improvements, lingering problems across the global economy are not resolved completely. Accordingly, the Committee has reiterated that it would be necessary to keep policy rates at low levels for a long period of time. However, the Central Bank will not hesitate to tighten monetary policy sooner than envisaged in the baseline scenario of the Inflation Report, should the recent increase in inflation expectations lead to a deterioration in price setting behavior. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Czech Republic,2010-03-25,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 2nd Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments March 25, 2010 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided by a majority vote to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 1%. Four members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for lowering rates by 0.25 percentage point. Reasons for the decision Headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon. Consistent with the forecast is stability of short-term interest rates close to current levels in 2010 H1 and a gradual rise in rates thereafter.

South Africa,2010-03-25,"The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas returned to within the inflation target range sooner than expected, in February 2010, when it measured 5,7 per cent. The moderation in inflation was fairly broad-based. The main contributors to the inflation outcome were the categories of housing and utilities and miscellaneous goods and services. The former category was driven mainly by electricity price increases of 26,8 per cent, while the latter category was driven by insurance costs relating to housing, health and transport. Food price inflation declined to 1,0 per cent, while communication costs declined by 22,0 per cent. Administered prices excluding petrol and paraffin increased by 10,8 per cent. Producer price inflation increased to 3,5 per cent in February 2010, compared with 2,7 per cent in the previous month. Food price inflation at the producer level remained well contained. Agricultural food prices declined at a year-on-year rate of 13,5 per cent, while manufactured food prices declined by 1,2 per cent. The CPI forecast of the South African Reserve Bank (the Bank) indicates an improved inflation outlook during 2010 and a relatively unchanged outlook for 2011. Inflation is expected to average 5,3 per cent and 5,4 per cent in 2010 and 2011 respectively, and to reach a low point at an average of 4,9 per cent during the third quarter of 2010. There is now greater certainty with respect to electricity tariff increases following the decision by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) to grant price increases to Eskom in the order of 25 per cent per annum, which was in line with the Bank's previous assumptions. However, because lower increases were granted to municipalities, the current forecast makes provision for electricity tariff increases of 20 per cent during the third quarters of 2010 and 2011. Other factors contributing to the improved expected inflation trajectory include favourable food price developments as well as lower-than-expected inflation outcomes. The Survey of Inflation Expectations published by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at Stellenbosch University shows a significant improvement in the first quarter of 2010, although expectations remain on average above the upper end of the target range. Average headline CPI inflation expectations in respect of 2010 declined from 7,7 per cent during the final quarter of 2009 to 6,5 per cent during the first quarter of 2010. Inflation expectations in respect of 2011 declined from 7,7 per cent to 6,7 per cent, and the expectation for 2012 is 6,8 per cent. The improved outlook was mainly due to the favourable change in the expectations of business sector and labour union respondents. The expectations of analysts remained more or less unchanged. Inflation expectations in the financial markets also reflected a more favourable inflation outlook. The Reuters survey of financial analysts shows some improvement relative to the previous month. Inflation expectations as measured by the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation-linked bonds across all maturities declined since January and reflect expectations within the target range over longer maturities. Growth in domestic expenditure appears to be recovering at a modest pace but does not currently pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook. Following five consecutive quarters of negative growth, real household consumption expenditure increased at an annualised rate of 1,4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2009. While expenditure growth on non-durable and semi-durable goods contracted, expenditure on durable goods, particularly motor vehicles, increased. Wholesale and retail trade sales in January appear to confirm this trend as positive month-on-month growth was experienced. Consumer confidence, as reflected in the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index, showed a significant recovery. The turnaround in household consumption expenditure is expected to continue at a slow pace. The improvements in the domestic equity markets appear to have reversed the negative wealth effects on consumption. Nevertheless the recovery in household consumption expenditure is expected to be constrained by the levels of household indebtedness, which increased to 79,8 per cent of disposable income of households in the fourth quarter of 2009. Other constraining factors include the strict credit criteria applied by banks, and persistently high levels of unemployment. Growth in total loans and advances to the private sector has been negative since September 2009, and declined further at a twelve-month rate of 1,2 per cent in January. Mortgage credit extension was again the only category that showed positive growth, while loans to companies declined further. The subdued credit extension data are a function of both demand and supply side effects. The strict credit criteria applied by banks have been partly a result of the rising levels of impaired advances which now appear to be leveling off. In January 2010, impaired advances as a percentage of total gross loans and advances declined slightly to 5,9 per cent. A significant proportion of these impairments relate to retail loans, reflecting continued pressure on the consumer. There are indications that the decline in employment in the formal non-agricultural sector appears to have slowed. According to the Quarterly Employment Survey, 18,000 jobs were created in the final quarter of 2009. However, on a seasonally adjusted basis, employment declined by 0,7 per cent, following the 5,1 per cent decline in the previous quarter. Cyclical employment trends tend to lag the upturn in the economy, and the impact of the recession on employment will take some time to be reversed. A countercyclical fiscal policy stance has been maintained. The national government deficit is projected to equal 7,2 per cent of GDP in the 2009/10 fiscal year and then to narrow over the next three years as the economy recovers, and to measure 4,7 per cent in the 2012/13 fiscal year. The public sector borrowing requirement is expected to reach 11,8 per cent of GDP, and the overall government debt to GDP ratio is expected to peak at 43 per cent in the medium term. Should this fiscal trajectory be maintained, the MPC does not foresee a possible conflict with monetary policy objectives. The economic growth outlook has improved somewhat over the past few months, although the output gap is expected to remain positive for some time. The 3,2 per cent annualised growth rate recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 confirmed that the economy has emerged from the recession, and the latest forecast of the Bank is that growth is likely to average 2,6 per cent in the current year. Although this compares favourably with the growth experienced in 2009, it is nevertheless still low. The manufacturing sector in particular grew relatively strongly in the last two quarters of 2009, although off a low base, following four consecutive quarters of negative growth. The Kagiso/BER Purchasing Managers Index indicates that this trend is likely to continue. Business confidence, as measured by the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index also showed an improvement but remains negative. The sustainability of the recovery in domestic growth will be influenced to a significant degree by the global growth trends. The pattern of the global economic recovery has remained unchanged with strong growth being recorded in Asia in particular, and more moderate growth in a number of countries in Latin America and Africa. The outlook for the United States and Europe is less positive with increased concerns about the sustainability of burgeoning fiscal deficits and government debt ratios. In the United States, the weak housing market also remains a constraint on household consumption expenditure. Although a number of countries have begun to normalise their policy rates, monetary and fiscal stimuli still remain in place in most industrialised economies, and indications are that there will not be an early reversal of these accommodative policies. Against this backdrop, the benign global inflation environment is expected to persist, and the risk of imported inflation is relatively low. While an appreciated rand exchange rate is a positive factor in the inflation outlook, an excessively strong exchange rate is a cause for concern from the perspective of overall macroeconomic balance. It is difficult to determine with precision an appropriate level of the exchange rate, but at recent levels the exchange rate may contribute to constraints in the recovery of export and import-competing sectors of the economy. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has appreciated from levels of around R7,60 against the US dollar to current levels of around R7,35. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand has appreciated by about 6 per cent since the previous meeting and by 3 per cent since the beginning of the year. The trade-weighted exchange rate was also influenced by the recent weakness in the euro and pound sterling against the US dollar. Since the previous meeting, the rand has appreciated by about 8 per cent and 11 per cent against the euro and pound sterling respectively. A number of factors continue to impact on the exchange rate of the rand. These include the sustained capital inflows into emerging markets in general in response to abnormally low interest rates in advanced economies, investor sentiment, and the recovery in commodity prices. The latter contributed to the narrowing of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments in the final quarter of 2009 to 2,8 per cent of GDP. Other supply side or exogenous factors are not expected to impart a significant upside risk to the inflation forecast. International oil prices have remained relatively stable in the US$70-US$80 dollar range, and moderate increases over the forecast period have been incorporated into the inflation forecast. Nevertheless an increase in the order of 50 cents per litre has been assumed for April, about half of which is due to increased fuel levies announced in the budget. Domestic food prices, which for most of last year were one of the main sources of upside risk to the inflation outlook, have recently contributed favourably to the inflation outlook. In the past few weeks, maize prices have declined significantly, despite an upward trend in other food prices globally. While it is not clear at this stage to what extent these price declines will be passed on to the consumer, these developments should at least constrain food price increases for some time. Wage settlements continue to indicate some moderation but remain positive in real terms. The ratio of total compensation of employees to real GDP declined from 10,1 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 2009 to 9,2 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter. Nominal unit labour costs increased from 5,7 per cent in the third quarter to 8,8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2009, but this figure was distorted by significant once-off adjustments to some public sector pay scales. Despite the reduced uncertainty associated with the electricity tariff increases, electricity and other administered price increases remain a threat to the inflation outlook. Of concern is the apparent trend towards greater reliance on high tariff increases to finance long term infrastructural expenditure projects. These increases are in effect relative price changes or implicit tax increases. However they contribute to the general inflation environment and remain a challenge for monetary policy. The assessment of the Monetary Policy Committee is that despite clear signs that the economy has emerged from the recession, the pace of recovery is expected to remain slow. The improved inflation environment has provided some space for an additional monetary stimulus to reinforce the sustainability of the upswing without jeopardising the achievement of the inflation target. The MPC has therefore decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 6,5 per cent per annum with effect from 26 March 2010. The MPC will continue to assess developments, and will adjust the monetary policy stance when necessary in order to achieve the inflation target."
India,2010-03-27,"Reserve Bank Announces Monetary Policy Measures There have been significant macroeconomic developments since the Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy in January 2010. On the growth front, the advance estimates by the CSO for 2009-10 and for Q3 of 2009-10 suggest that the recovery is consolidating. Data on industrial production currently available up to January 2010 show that the uptrend is being maintained. The manufacturing sector, in particular, has recorded robust growth. The sharp acceleration in the growth of the capital goods sector points to the revival of investment activity. After contracting for 13 straight months, exports have expanded since November 2009. That the recovery is gaining momentum is also evident from the sustained increase in bank credit and the resources raised by the commercial sector from non-bank sources. Even as this is happening against the backdrop of improving global conditions, recent real GDP and industrial production clearly suggest that the positive trend is predominantly due to domestic factors. The developments on the inflation front, however, are a source of growing concern. Notwithstanding some moderation in recent weeks, food prices remain at elevated levels. In fact, consumer price inflation, as measured by various consumer price indices, has accentuated further. The acceleration in the prices of non-food manufactured goods and fuel items in recent months has been of particular concern. In the Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy in January 2010, the Reserve Bank had raised the CRR by 75 basis points in two stages. This reflected the growing confidence in the economy and the risk of supply side inflation spilling over into a wider inflationary process. However, the policy rates were left unchanged as it was felt that the recovery was still to fully take hold and that pre-mature tightening might undermine the recovery process. Subsequent developments show that the recovery is increasingly taking hold. On the other hand, inflationary pressures have accentuated and have been spilling over to the wider inflationary process. The recent industrial production data suggest revival of private demand, which could potentially add to inflationary pressures. Anchoring inflation expectations and containing overall inflation have become imperative. Headline WPI inflation on a year-on-year basis at 9.9 per cent in February 2010 has exceeded our baseline projection of 8.5 for end-March 2010 set out in the Third Quarter Review. Year-on-year WPI non-food manufacturing products (weight: 52.2 per cent) inflation, which was negative (-0.4 per cent) in November 2009, turned marginally positive (0.7 per cent) in December 2009 and rose sharply thereafter to 2.8 per cent in January 2010 and further to 4.3 per cent in February 2010. Year-on-year fuel price inflation also surged from (-)0.8 per cent in November 2009 to 5.9 per cent in December 2009, to 6.9 per cent in January 2010 and further2 to 10.2 per cent in February 2010. With rising demand side pressures, there is risk that WPI inflation may cross double digits in March 2010. To sum up, since the Third Quarter Review in January 2010, while the recovery in growth has proceeded broadly along expected lines, the inflationary pressures have intensified beyond our baseline projection. Even as food prices are showing signs of moderation, they remain elevated. More importantly, the rate of increase in the prices of non-food manufactured goods has accelerated quite sharply. Furthermore, increasing capacity utilisation and rising commodity and energy prices are exerting pressure on overall inflation. Taken together, these factors heighten the risks of supply-side pressures translating into a generalised inflationary process. Policy Measures The Third Quarter Review had mentioned that our instruments of monetary policy are all currently at levels that are more consistent with a crisis situation than with a fast recovering economy. In the emergent scenario, low policy rates can complicate the inflation outlook and impair inflationary expectations, particularly given the recent escalation in the prices of non-food manufactured goods. The Third Quarter Review had also indicated that the Reserve Bank would take further action as warranted. Our assessment is that at the this juncture further policy action is warranted. Given the lags in monetary policy, it is better to respond in a timely manner, even if it is outside the scheduled policy reviews, than take stronger measures at a later stage when inflationary expectations have accentuated. Therefore, as a part of the calibrated exit strategy, initiated in the Second Quarter Review in October 2009 and carried forward in the Third Quarter Review in January 2010, it has been decided : to raise the repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 4.75 per cent to 5.0 per cent with immediate effect. to raise the reverse repo rate under the LAF by 25 basis points from 3.25 per cent to 3.5 per cent with immediate effect. These measures should anchor inflationary expectations and contain inflation going forward. As liquidity in the banking system will remain adequate, credit expansion for sustaining the recovery will not be affected. The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions, particularly the price situation, and take further action as warranted.

Pakistan,2010-03-27,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 27th March 2010 Building on initial gains in macroeconomic stability the economy is looking to further its traction for sustainable recovery. Inflationary pressures have dampened but continue to persist, mainly due to alignment of energy sector prices with market factors. Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) has consistently grown since October 2009 after contraction for almost 20 months but remains fragile. Reduction in the external current account deficit has allowed SBP to rebuild foreign exchange reserves, despite shortfalls in external financial flows. However uncertainty has increased in some areas, particularly the fiscal sector, with implications for the rest of the economy, including monetary policy. Although CPI inflation (YoY) has come down to 13. percent in February 2010, it is high and exhibits persistence. After low of. percent in October 2009, inflation slipped back largely due to increases in electricity tariffs, adjustments in the prices of domestic petroleum products, and administered prices of commodities like wheat. To which extent these factors will influence other prices in the economy and expectations of inflation in the coming months remain difficult to assess. Nonetheless SBP expects the average CPI inflation for FY10 to remain close to 12 percent. Despite presence of high inflation, crippling electricity shortages, and challenging security conditions, domestic economic activity has picked up in recent months. cumulative growth of. percent during the first seven months of FY10 in the Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) is encouraging. Sustainability of this trend in LSM and overall economic growth would depend on improvements in the availability of electricity and security situation. In addition, this would need supportive growth in private sector credit, which in turn depends on reduction in the scale of government and public sector's reliance on bank borrowings. The balance of payments position has improved considerably. The external current account deficit has come down to $2. billion during July February. FY10 compared to $8 billion in the same period last year. This has allowed SBP to accumulate foreign exchange reserves, $11. billion as on 26th March 2010, and has facilitated stability in the foreign exchange market. However other developments in the external sector, such as Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) and workers' remittances, need to be monitored closely, especially when prospects of foreign official flows remain unclear. The key source of uncertainty, however, lies in the weak fiscal position. Burdened by significant security related expenditures and shortfalls in revenues, keeping the fiscal deficit for FY10 within target would be challenging. Partial phasing out of subsidies and reduction in development expenditures have helped in containing expenditures but has lead to surge in domestic prices and is hurting crucial public sector investment. Similarly increased Petroleum Development Levy (PDL) receipts, due to higher oil imports, have cushioned the lower tax revenues to some extent but have contributed towards inertia in domestic inflation. During the remaining months of FY10, uncertainty regarding non-tax revenues on Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN account of foreign reimbursements and extent of remaining power sector subsidies adds to fiscal complications. The financing mix of the fiscal deficit also seems uncertain. The external financing for budget, especially the part pledged by the Friends of Democratic Pakistan (FoDP), has mostly been elusive. Of the Rs110 billion net external budget financing received during H1-FY10. Rs93 billion were provided by the IMF. With an understanding that this part of IMF money, provided in lieu of FoDP flows, is for short term, the importance of the timing of external budgetary flows cannot be overemphasized. Not surprisingly, therefore, government borrowing from the SBP has been substantial in Q3-FY10. According to provisional figures the outstanding stock of government borrowing from SBP (on cash basis), as on 25th March 2010, stands at Rs1240 billion, which is Rs110 billion higher than the quarterly ceiling limit. With less than expected retirement of credit availed by the government for commodity operations and commencement of the 2010 wheat procurement season, pressure will build on the banking system resources. Continued borrowings by the Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs), partly because of the lingering energy sector circular debt, are also straining systemic liquidity. Further the high infection ratio of credit to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) at 2 percent and Agriculture at 17 percent may lead banks to show reluctance to extend credit to the private sector even when the pace of growth of incremental Non-performing Loans (NPLs) has slowed considerably in the last quarter of 2009. In this environment, with resources tied up in both commodity and circular debt and risk averse behaviour, banks will tend to negotiate higher rates on risk-free or government guaranteed debt. For instance, the first issuance of the Term Finance Certificate (TFC) in March 2009 was priced at KIBOR plus.75 percent, while the second issuance in September 2009 was at KIBOR plus percent. Similarly the rates for financing commodity operations were around KIBOR plus. to.75 percent. This reflects that banks are building in the cost of ongoing rollover, instead of repayment, of outstanding credit. Thus the attractively priced government borrowing may lead to stagnation in private sector credit growth. Government will have to revisit its commodity intervention strategy, sooner than later, so that commodity operation requirements may go back to normal levels. Similarly complete resolution of the circular debt would be essential. Apart from releasing banking system resources and easing pressure on market rates, it will alleviate some constraints impeding production of electricity in the country thus paving way for sustainable economic recovery. Given the uncertainties pertaining to the fiscal and quasi-fiscal sectors, present stance of monetary policy is striking difficult balance between reducing inflation, ensuring financial stability, and supporting economic recovery. An upward adjustment in SBP's policy rate, at this juncture, runs the risk of impeding the still nascent recovery, while downward adjustment runs the risk of fuelling an already high inflation. Hence SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 12. percent. Page of."
Israel,2010-03-28,"28.03.2010 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for April 2010 by 25 basis points The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for April 2010 will be increased by 25 basis points to 1.5 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The CPI for February declined by 0.3 percent, theupper limit of the range of forecasts, which were of declines between 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent. The index was affected by the cut in electricity prices and the reduction in VAT in January. The housing component dropped for the third month in succession, giving a cumulative reduction of 1.4 percent. In the last twelve months the index rose by 3.6 percent, and excluding the effect of government actions, by 3.1 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Forecasters expect inflation as reflected in the indices in the next twelve months (March 2010 to February 2011) to average 2.6 percent; and their expectations of inflation in 2010 average 1.8 percent. They forecast that inflation measured over the previous twelve months will return to within the target range with the publication of the April index. Inflation expectations for the next twelve monthsderived from the capital market remained steady, close to the upper limit of the target inflation range. With regard to the Bank of Israel interest rate, most forecasters do not expect an increase for April, but on average they expect that in a year's time it will be 2.9 percent. Expectations derived from the capital market suggest that the interest rate could increase even for April, and that in a year's time it will be 2.5 percent. Real economic activity: Most indicators show that real economic activity continued to expand in the first quarter of 2010, but it seems likely that the rate of increase will be lower than that in the previous quarter. The continued increase in activity was reflected in the composite state-of-the-economy index for February, which rose by 0.2 percent, in domestic VAT receipts, and in various indices of activity, including the index of manufacturing production, the index of trade and services revenue, indices of consumer confidence, and the index of the probability of a slowdown calculated by the Bank of Israel Research Department based on Google search data. Initial findings of the Bank of Israel Companies Survey for the first quarter indicate continued expansion and expectations that it will continue in the next quarter. In contrast, in the last few months the increases in direct tax revenues, goods and services exports, and consumer goods imports all moderated. The labor market and wages: Most recent data from the labor market showed continued recovery, but with differences between industries. The ManpowerSurvey for the fourth quarter of 2009 pointed to a further decline in the unemployment rate, to 7.4 percent. National Insurance Institute figures forthe fourth quarter of 2009 indicate a 0.5 percent increase in employment compared with the previous quarter. The real wage fell by 2.2 percent compared with its level in the fourth quarter of 2008, and the nominal wage fell by 0.7 percent The upward trend in health tax receipts that started in July 2009 persisted in February, with an increase of 3.6 percent compared with February 2009 (excluding the increased revenues resulting from the doublingin August 2009 of the upper limit on wages on which employees' National Insurance payments are payable). Budget data: The domestic budget deficit in February, excluding credit, was NIS 2.4 billion, compared with a deficit of NIS 2.7 billion in February 2009. This continues the trend following the turnaround in the deficit in November 2009. In January and February there wasa cumulative surplus of about 0.2 percent of GDP, lower than the surplusesin the first two months of the years 2005 to 2008. In the first two monthsof 2009, however, there was a deficit. The surplus since the beginning of 2010 is higher than the surplus given by the seasonal path consistent with the budget deficit ceiling, and is due to the upward trend in tax revenues.Budget expenditure accelerated in February, and the monthly expenditure was consistent with the seasonal path representing full performance of the budget. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the previous monetary policy discussions of February 21 and March 25, the shekel appreciated by 0.3 percent against the dollar, and by 1.3 percent against the euro.In this period the nominal effective exchange rate of the shekel appreciated by 0.5 percent. During the month the euro weakened markedly against mostcurrencies. The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of February 21 and March 25, the Tel Aviv 25 index rose by 4.2 percent, and the Tel Aviv 100 index by 3.7 percent. This was similar to the trendin the major stock exchanges. The Tel Aviv 25 index has returned to its previous peak level. Israel government bonds showed mixed trends, with an increase in yields in unindexed shekel, mainly medium term, bonds, which led to a flattening of the yield curve, in contrast to a drop of about 10-20 b.p in the return on indexed, also mainly medium term, bonds. The yield gap between Israeli and US unindexed 10-year government bonds contractedsignificantly, to less than 100 b.p., for the first time since the end of 2007. The yield to maturity on twelve-month makam increased, and passed the 2 percent mark, returning to the levels prevailing in January. The positive trend in the Tel-Bond indices persisted, with the Tel-Bond 20 index rising by 1.2 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 0.4 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, remained steady at 1.16 percent. CDS spreads of other economies also remained stable, with a slight downward tendency. The money supply: The M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) decreased by 1.2 percent in February, following its decline of 1.9 percent in January. The M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits up to one year) declined by 1.3 percent in February, after increasing by 0.5 percent in January. The credit market: Total outstanding bank credit dropped in January, with a 0.6 percent decline in credit to the business sector and a modest increase of 0.2 percent in credit to households. Total credit to the business sector fell by about 1 percent in January, to NIS 729 billion. Housing credit continued upwards in January, but at a moderate pace of 0.7 percent, to NIS 157 billion. Against the background of the rising interest rate path, total borrowing via new mortgages declined in February, following an even steeper drop in January. The increase in corporate bond issues continued, but with a greater proportion of lower-rated issuing companies. At the same time the balances of funds specializing in corporate bonds increased, at the expense of money market funds and those specializing ingovernment bonds. The world economy: Most macroeconomic data published this month indicate that the recovery in the global economy continued, with further growth in the services sector and in employment. Questions remain regarding the sustainability of global growth without governmental support. Inflation and inflation expectations remain low in the advanced economies, mainly in light of the persistent weakness of labor markets and the large output gaps.In the emerging market countries, however, inflationary signs are becomingvisible, and some of the large ones are expected to increase their interest rates soon. Central banks and governments face the conflict between the need to continue with monetary and fiscal incentives on the one hand and ballooning deficits and debt/GDP ratios on the other. At the same time, share markets around the world are rising, supported by companies' sound situation, favorable macroeconomic data, and the relative calm with regard to Greece's debt crisis. Nonetheless, the main boost to the markets is still provided by the low levels of interest, which are expected to remain low for the next few months. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to increase the interest rate for April to 1.5 percent is part of the gradual process of returning interest to a more normal level, intended to return inflation to within the target range and to keep it there, and to contribute to the further recovery of economic activity, while supporting financial stability. The path of the interest rate will be determined in accordance with the inflation environment, the entrenchment of growth, in Israel and globally, the rate at which the major central banks increase their interest rates, and in light of developments in the exchange ratesof the shekel. The current increase is made against the background of growth that continues to become more firmly based, inflation expectations that are close to the upper limit of the target inflation range, and the rise in asset prices. However, monetary policy continues to be expansionary even after this increase. Forecasters' average expectations regarding the indices over the next twelve months are for inflation of 2.6 percent. Twelve-month expectations derived from the capital market are close to the upper limit of the target inflation range. Forecasters predict that inflation measured over the previous twelve monthswill come within the target range a month from now. Most indicators, including preliminary findings from the Bank of Israel Companies Survey, suggest that economic activity continued to expand in the first quarterof 2010. There is still uncertainty, however, regarding the strength of the expansion. Interest rates of the central banks of the leading advanced economies are very low, and are expected to remain so during the coming months. Nonetheless, some of them are continuing to reduce their use of special instruments of monetary accommodation, and other central banks are starting to increase their interest rates. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic and financial developments, and will use the instruments available to itto achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decisionwill be published on 12 April 2010. The decision regarding the interest rate for April 2010 will be published at 17:30 on 26 April 2010. 28.03.2010 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for April 2010 by 25 basis points.

Romania,2010-03-29,"In its meeting of March 29, 2010, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR will continue to closely monitor domestic developments and the global economic evolutions so as to adequately adjust its instruments to ensure the achievement of its objectives related to both price stability and financial stability, while fulfilling the commitments under the agreements with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions. The analysis of macroeconomic developments show the resumption of the disinflation process amid a drop in adjusted CORE 21 annual inflation rate and an appreciation of the leu, together with the existence of signs of recovery in some sectors, while for others uncertainties persist. The annual inflation rate fell to 4.49 percent in February after it surged to 5.2 percent in January under the temporary impact of the exogenous shock of the adjustment of excise duties on tobacco. Statistical data reveal a slightly slower decline in final private consumption, an improved export performance while the current account deficit has remained at sustainable levels. Meanwhile, the annual dynamics of credit to the private sector, especially of leu-denominated loans, have remained in negative territory. A significant improvement of the liquidity in the banking sector is worth noting, while the average rates on banks' new deposits as well as lending rates on new loans, despite their downward adjustment, have remained relatively high in relation to the monetary policy rate. The monetary policy stance stayed prudent seeking to ensure the convergence of inflation towards medium-term objectives as well as the normalization of money market and banking interest rates. This aims to consolidate favorable conditions for a sustainable revival of lending and the achievement of a solid economic recovery. The outlook shows a continuation of disinflation as well as persistent uncertainties related to trends on the global economy, capital flows, administered prices as well as of some volatile prices. In this context, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 6.5 percent per annum from 7.0 percent. Consequently, starting March 30, 2010, the rate on the deposit facility will be cut to 2.5 percent per annum from 3.0 percent and the rate on the lending facility (Lombard) will be 10.5 percent per annum versus 11.0 percent. At the same time, the penalty rate for deficits of leu-denominated minimum reserve requirements will drop to 15.75 percent starting with the April 24-May 23, 2010 maintenance period. The NBR Board has also decided to ensure an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu-denominated and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR will continue to closely monitor domestic developments and global economic evolutions so as to adequately adjust its instruments to ensure the achievement of its objectives related to both price stability and financial stability, in the context of achieving the commitments made under the agreements with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for May 4, 2010, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1) The adjusted annual CORE2 inflation rate is calculated by excluding the administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) as well as of prices of tobacco and alcohol from the headline consumer price index."
Poland,2010-03-31,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 31 March 2010 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 30-31 March 2010 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate at 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) discount rate at 4.00% on an annual basis. Growth in economic activity in the United States and a slow improvement in economic conditions in the euro area continue. However, the labour market situation in the developed economies remains unfavourable, which is in line with expectations. At the same time, the largest emerging economies see noticeable recovery in economic activity accompanied by a rise in inflation. The global economic recovery has so far been supported by strongly expansionary macroeconomic policies based on both conventional and non-standard instruments. However, negative consequences of those policies, mostly those related to public debt accumulation, are becoming increasingly visible. Over the recent period, currencies of many emerging economies, including the zloty, have appreciated. Nonetheless, uncertainty in the international financial markets remains elevated, mostly driven by the fiscal crisis in Greece. The measures undertaken by international institutions seem to restrain this uncertainty only to a moderate degree. GUS data on GDP have confirmed earlier estimates according to which 2009 Q4 saw a recovery in economic activity. Monthly data on the situation of the Polish economy at the beginning of 2010 point to a continued improvement in some sectors, primarily in manufacturing. At the same time, however, the most recent data on retail sales as well as construction and assembly output may signal slightly weaker than expected economic activity in Poland in 2010 Q1. It cannot be ruled out, though, that this is a temporary phenomenon related to unfavourable weather conditions. The small scale of decrease in employment in the enterprise sector may signal a gradual deceleration of the unfavourable labour market tendencies, despite further growth in unemployment rate largely driven by increasing labour force participation. The growth in loans to the non-financial sector remains low. At the same time, the improvement in the financial results of enterprises for 2009 may reduce their demand for bank loans. In line with expectations, in February 2010 annual CPI inflation decreased markedly (to 2.9% as compared with the revised downwards 3.5% in January 2010), moving closer to the inflation target of 2.5%. The fall in the annual inflation rate was primarily driven by lower annual rates of fuel and energy carriers prices, largely due to a statistical base effect. Core inflation also declined. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. In line with available forecasts, in the months to come the annual CPI will be lowered by negative base effects connected with the surge in prices of excise goods and food prices in 2009. Other factors conductive to lower inflation include: low current demand pressure, the hitherto considerable zloty appreciation and moderate growth of labour costs. In turn, inflation decline in 2010 may be curbed by rises in commodity prices in the world markets and in administered prices, including gas prices and fees subject to decisions of local government units. In the Council's assessment the probabilities of inflation running below or above the inflation target in the medium term are balanced. In the Council's view, however, the impact of the hitherto pursued expansionary macroeconomic policies abroad and their prospective reversal are an important risk factor which may affect this assessment. An important factor affecting monetary policy is the situation of the public finance sector. Introducing measures aimed at permanently reducing the deficit of the general government sector and at curbing the increase of the public debt will support macroeconomic stability and allow to meet the criteria for euro adoption. The Council maintains the opinion that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organisational conditions. The Council has adopted a resolution changing the resolution on creating and unwinding provisions against the FX risk of the zloty against foreign currencies at the National Bank of Poland."
Euroarea,2010-04-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 March 2010, price developments are expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010. Overall, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to expand at a moderate pace in 2010, in an environment of uncertainty, with the growth pattern possibly being uneven owing to a number of special factors. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressures over the medium term. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Benefiting from the ongoing recovery in the world economy, the significant macroeconomic stimulus provided and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the banking system, the euro area economy grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2009, after a period of sharp decline, while in the fourth quarter real GDP was flat, according to Eurostat's second release. Available indicators, in particular further positive information from business surveys, suggest that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010, although it may have been affected by a number of special factors, including adverse weather conditions. As a consequence, euro area real GDP growth is likely to have remained uneven around the turn of the year, making it advisable to look through the quarterly volatility and to compare growth developments on a half-yearly basis. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects real GDP growth to continue to expand at a moderate pace in 2010, owing to the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and the expectation that low capacity utilisation is likely to dampen investment and that consumption is being hampered by weak labour market prospects. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced, in an environment of uncertainty. On the upside, the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected and confidence may improve more than expected. Furthermore, there may be greater than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. On the downside, concerns remain relating to renewed tensions in some financial market segments, a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and the intensification of protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.5% in March 2010, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 0.9% in February. While no breakdown of overall HICP developments is available yet, this higher than expected outcome may be related in particular to the energy component as well as food prices, possibly partly as a result of weather conditions. Inflation is expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon In line with a slow recovery in domestic and foreign demand, overall price, cost and wage developments are expected to stay subdued. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. They relate, in particular, to further developments in economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 was -0.4% in February. Annual growth in loans to the private sector also remained weak, at -0.4%, despite a positive flow in the month. Overall, the latest data continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that, in the medium term, the inflationary pressures associated with monetary developments are low. The growth of M3 and loans is likely to remain weak also in the coming months. The continued steep yield curve fosters the allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside M3 and implies that actual M3 growth is weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion. At the same time, the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different M3 instruments imply low opportunity costs of holding funds in the most liquid components included in M1, which continued to grow at a robust annual rate of 10.9% in February. However, the monthly flows in the components of M3 were generally small in February, suggesting that the strong impact of the prevailing interest rate constellation may be progressively waning. The negative annual growth of bank loans to the private sector continues to conceal countervailing developments: positive, strengthening annual growth in loans to households on the one hand, and negative annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations on the other hand. At the same time, the flow of loans to firms in February was positive for the first time since August 2009 and halted the decline in the annual growth rate. Such positive short-term developments need to be assessed with caution, owing to the volatility in monthly data. In addition, it is a normal feature of the business cycle that loans to non-financial corporations remain weak for some time after economic activity has picked up. The reduction in the size of banks' overall balance sheets appears to have come to a halt in the early months of 2010. However, the challenge remains for them to manage possible further adjustments while at the same time ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector. To address this challenge, banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen their capital bases further, and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 March 2010, price developments are expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010. Overall, the Governing Council expects the euro area economy to expand at a moderate pace in 2010, in an environment of uncertainty, with the growth pattern possibly being uneven owing to a number of special factors. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressures over the medium term. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, it is now essential that governments reduce budget imbalances and correct excessive deficits by the agreed deadlines. In a number of euro area countries, fiscal consolidation will start this year and in all others corrective measures will need to be in place by 2011 at the latest. Fiscal consolidation will need to exceed substantially the annual structural adjustment of 0.5% of GDP set as a minimum requirement by the Stability and Growth Pact, and there is a need to fully define and implement credible fiscal adjustment strategies. This requires determined efforts, notably on the part of countries with high government deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios, not least in view of the expected rising budgetary costs associated with an ageing population. The Governing Council welcomes the statement on Greece made by the Heads of State and Government of the euro area countries on 25 March. We fully support the intention to strengthen surveillance of economic and budgetary risks and the instruments for their prevention as well as the excessive deficit procedure. We also welcome the decision to work on a robust crisis resolution framework. Progress in these fields should aim to support the sustainability of public finances and promote the smooth functioning of EMU. Regarding structural reforms, the agreements reached at the European Council on 25 and 26 March on the Europe 2020 strategy should help to reinforce job creation, competitiveness and sustainable growth. To this end, policies should now focus on increasing competition, while sectoral support schemes implemented during the crisis should be phased out. In labour markets, sufficient wage flexibility and a reinforcement of incentives to work are required, in order to avoid higher structural unemployment over the coming years. In the same vein, an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector remains essential. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks' resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability. Regarding our collateral framework, the Governing Council has decided to keep the minimum credit threshold for marketable and non-marketable assets in the Eurosystem collateral framework at investment-grade level (i.e. BBB-/Baa3) beyond the end of 2010, except in the case of asset-backed securities (ABSs). In addition, the Governing Council has decided to apply, as of 1 January 2011, a schedule of graduated valuation haircuts to the assets rated in the BBB+ to BBB- range (or equivalent). This graduated haircut schedule will replace the uniform haircut add-on of 5% that is currently applied to these assets. The detailed haircut schedule will be based on a number of parameters which are specified in the press release to be published after today's press conference."
South Korea,2010-04-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. In the global economy, emerging market economies have shown favorable performances, and the trend of improvement in the economies of major advanced countries, such as the US and Japan, has gathered pace to some degree. However, there are latent risk factors present, including the government debt problems in some European countries. Domestic economic activity has sustained a trend of recovery. Even though construction investment has been somewhat inactive, exports have shown buoyancy, and consumption and facilities investment have steadily increased. This recovery trend is expected to be maintained. Considering the overseas risk factors, however, there still remains uncertainty as to the economic growth path. Consumer price inflation has decelerated, led by the prices of services, and is anticipated to be stable for some time. In the real estate market, the upward trend of prices has been blunted, with transactions remaining inactive. In the financial markets, with the expansion in inflows of foreign portfolio investment funds, stock prices have risen, and long-term and short-term market interest rates have decreased. The scale of the increase in mortgage lending has widened slightly due to the decline in lending interest rates, and the increase in the numbers of newly occupied and lotting-out apartments. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain the accommodative policy stance for the time being in such a way as to help sustain the trend of recovery in economic activity, taking into overall consideration financial and economic conditions domestically and abroad."
Turkiye,2010-04-13,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep policy rates unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 6.50 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 2.50 percent, lending rate at 12 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent. Recent data releases suggest that the recovery in economic activity is ongoing. Domestic demand is following a gradual growth trend despite lingering uncertainty regarding external demand, suggesting that it would take a while before industrial capacity utilization rates return to pre-crisis levels. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates remain at high levels. The Committee has noted that annual inflation rate would hover significantly above the target for sometime before reverting back to a downward trend as the temporary factors taper off starting in the last quarter of the year. Inflation rate would converge to levels consistent with the targets by early 2011. Core inflation indicators would increase in April as well, due to temporary tax cuts of the previous year, but would continue to remain at levels below the target. The Committee has indicated that elevated levels of inflation, albeit temporary, warrants close monitoring of price setting behavior. Observing these developments and the normalization in the money and credit markets, the Committee has decided to gradually remove the liquidity measures implemented during the crisis. However, despite recent improvements, lingering problems across the global economy are not resolved completely. Accordingly, the Committee has stated that it may be necessary to maintain policy rates at current levels for some time, and to keep them at low levels for a long period. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Georgia,2010-04-14,"14.04.10 The NBG Keeps its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) unchanged at 5 Percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on April 14, 2010 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 5 percent. An annual growth rate of the gross domestic product of 0.4 percent was recorded in the last quarter of 2009, following a recession that lasted for a year-and-a-half. The annual rate of inflation in March of 2010 was 5.8 percent. Inflation dynamics are in accordance with the existing forecasts. Inflation forecast parameters have not changed noticeably since the Committee's last meeting and in the medium term, inflation should stay within the six percent range. The fast pace of growth in the monetary aggregates is worth noting. In April, the annual growth rate of M3 and M2 money aggregates exceeds 30 percent, which is largely due to growth in deposits over the last several months. Time deposits are the main driving factor behind the growth in deposits. In the first quarter of the current year, a growth tendency has also been observed in lending by banks to the economy. Despite the fact that the current growth in lending has been relatively sluggish, it is expected that the banking system will become more active in the credit markets over the coming months. From April, the National Bank is planning on implementing several important steps that are aimed at re-invigorating monetary policy. In particular, the minimum reserve requirements on Lari- denominated deposits will be raised to 10 percent, which is aimed at the development of the money markets and giving an incentive to the interbank credit market. At the same time, the NBG will remunerate additionally required amount on mandatory reserves with interest rate equal to policy rate. At the same time, the NBG will make available guaranteed refinancing instruments with variable interest rates, which are aimed at boosting lending in domestic currency and increase the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Simultaneously, changes in the legal framework envisage the expansion of eligible collateral (collateral base) for use with the abovementioned instruments, which is yet another step towards aiding the larization of the economy. In addition. NBG will use the Bloomberg trade platform for refinancing loan instruments. Moreover the National Bank will introduce standing facilities from April 29 in the form of overnight loans and overnight deposits, which should reduce the fluctuation of interest rates in the interbank market. Changes in reserve requirements also incorporate and cover funds borrowed from non-residents, in order to place funds borrowed from foreign sources on equal footing with funds borrowed in domestic markets. The aforementioned change will go into effect in September and its goal is to aid the larization of the banking system, which is vital for the effective implementation of monetary policy and as a result, to achieve a stable economic environment. The NBG will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on May 25, 2010."
Chile,2010-04-15,"P RESS RELEASE Santiago, 15 April 2010 Monetary Policy Meeting  April 2010* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50% (annual). Internationally, volatility in financial markets has tended to decline despite turbulences in some European economies. The prices of copper and oil have remained high. Prospects for the recovery of global output for this year are still favorable. Domestically, available information on output does not differ from that contained in the last Monetary Policy Report. In March, the CPI posted a smaller increase than had been foreseen by the market. However, private inflation expectations consider this to be a temporary phenomenon. In the longer term, they are consistent with the baseline scenario in the Report. It is estimated that the gleaning of accurate short-term statistics will continue to be problematic because of the disruptions associated with the earthquake of February 27th. The Board considers that macroeconomic conditions and private expectations are consistent with the monetary policy normalization contained in the recent Report. It reiterates that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Nigeria,2010-04-15,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 69 of the Special Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. April 15, 2010 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held a special meeting on April 15, 2010 to, among other things, consider the modalities for the injection of N500 billion into the real economy in continuation of the current quantitative easing policy. It also reviewed domestic economic conditions during the first quarter of 2010 against the backdrop of the global economic and financial developments with a view to guiding monetary and financial sector policies for the rest of 2010. The MPC noted the persisting tight credit conditions and the continuing under-performance of key monetary aggregates which had informed its earlier decision to embark on a quantitative easing policy to be implemented through investment in debentures to be issued by the Bank of Industry (BOI). The Committee commended the co-operation of key stakeholders in preparing the modalities for the injection of the N500 billion financing facility for the emergency power projects dedicated to industrial clusters and restructuring/refinancing of DMBs' exposures to the manufacturing sector and SMEs. It stressed the need for even greater co-operation in fast-tracking on-going reform efforts in the banking sector to ensure the smooth flow of credit to the real sector of the economy as well as energizing reforms in the power and other economic infrastructure sectors, to promote private sector/foreign investment and employment-generating growth. In this regard, the MPC welcomes the attention to the power sector by the Federal Government. The Committee emphasized that while economic reforms and human capital development remain key ingredients for economic growth, 1 the Bank is mindful of the supportive role that macroeconomic and financial stability plays in achieving sustainable growth and, will continue to focus attention on these two areas. On the global scene, the Committee noted that the rebound in global economic activity which started in the second half of 2009, has been sustained. The rebound was driven largely by the fiscal policy stimuli undertaken in both the developed and emerging market economies in response to the global financial crisis and the ensuing economic slowdown. In the wake of the financial and economic crises, monetary policy was considerably eased with interest rates down to record levels in most advanced and emerging markets, and central bank balance sheets expanded considerably to accommodate the stimulus packages. The key concerns, however, remain the speed and sustainability of the recovery process which is progressing at varying degrees across the different regions. The recovery in the advanced economies is still weak with real output projected to remain below its pre-crisis level until late 2011. However growth in the emerging and developing economies is expected to recover faster given their stronger initial economic conditions and swift policy responses. The MPC also noted the continuing rebound in commodity prices, particularly crude oil prices, which is helping to support growth in commodity producing regions, including Nigeria. However the inflation risk of the rebound in energy prices appears to be mitigated by the subsisting low 2 levels of capacity utilization, weak private demand and well-anchored inflation expectations. The MPC further observed that while financial markets have recovered remarkably faster than expected, financing conditions, especially for businesses and firms, were likely to remain weak in the near-term as financial institutions continue to maintain a cautious approach to credit extension. It noted the relative stability prevailing in most segments of the market and the need for policies to ensure their sustenance. Key Domestic Macroeconomic and Financial Developments Output and Prices: The robust output growth recorded in 2009 continued in 2010. Provisional data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicates that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 668 percent in the first quarter of 2010, down from 744 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2009, but up from the 450 per cent recorded in the first quarter of 2009. The growth was largely driven by the non-oil sector. Overall GDP growth for 2010 was projected at 753 per cent which is higher than the revised estimate of 666 per cent recorded in 2009. Quarterly GDP growth rates of 724, 736 and 851 per cent was projected for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2010, respectively. The non-oil sector was expected to remain the main driver of overall economic growth, with agriculture, wholesale and retail trade, and services contributing 201 per cent, 210 per cent and 209 per cent, respectively. The Committee noted that the impressive growth forecasts reflected prospects for moderate rainfall in 2010, which would boost crop production and the 3 relative peace in the Niger-Delta, which could enhance crude oil and natural gas production. The year-on-year headline inflation rose from 120 per cent in the last quarter of 2009 to stabilize at 123 per cent in January and February 2010. Similarly core inflation stabilized at 101 per cent in January and February 2010, up from 97 per cent recorded in the last quarter of 2009. The stability in the domestic price level could be attributed to a number of factors, namely, the continuing monetary contraction, the delay in the passage of the 2010 federal budget and the improvement in the supply of petroleum products, amongst others. Notwithstanding these developments, the Committee restated its earlier position that the threat of inflationary pressure in the near-to-medium term remains real, but that it will continue to monitor price developments in the months ahead with a view to creating an enabling environment for sustainable growth and employment. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments: Provisional data showed that relative to end-December 2009, broad money (M2) declined by 023 per cent at end-February 2010, which, when annualized represented a decline of 138 per cent, compared to the indicative growth target of 2926 per cent for 2010 and the annualized M2 decline of 516 per cent in the corresponding February of 2009. The reserve money (RM), which stood at N1,,66850 at end-December 2009, declined to N1,,57433 and N 1,,63660 billion in January and February 2010, respectively, but rose to N 1, 78221 billion in March 2010. As at April 8, 2010, the RM level of N1, 7100 billion was just below the provisional 2010 4 second quarter indicative benchmark of N1, 87280 billion by N16276 billion or 869 per cent. Available data showed that in February 2010, aggregate domestic credit (net) grew by 266 per cent over the December 2009 level, and by 1596 per cent when annualized, which is higher than the annualized decline of 556 per cent recorded in the corresponding period of 2009, but below the 2010 indicative target of 5554 per cent. Credit to government (net), which grew by 1784 per cent, was the major contributor to the growth in aggregate credit (net) in February 2010, as credit to the private sector declined, by 197 per cent. The annualized growth rate of credit to the private sector as at February 2010, was -1182 per cent, as against the provisional benchmark of 3154 per cent for 2010. The substantial growth of credit to government (net) reflects the risk aversion of the DMBs and suggests the possible crowding out of private sector credit. During the first quarter of 2010, the downward slide in interest rates in the domestic money market, which began in July 2009, following the Bank's decision to guarantee interbank transactions, continued. The low rates provide ample evidence of the surplus funds in the banking system that resulted from the huge volume of funds injected through fiscal operations. The weighted average interbank call rate, which was 289 per cent as at end- December 2009, declined to 248, 217, and 150 per cent in January. February, and March, 2010, respectively. Similarly the securitized open- buy-back (OBB) rate, which was 264 per cent at end-December 2009, declined to 246, 220, and 131 per cent in January. February, and March 5 2010, respectively, compared with the monetary policy rate (MPR) of 600 per cent and Standing Deposit Facility rate of 10 per cent. Notwithstanding the falling interbank rates, the DMBs' interest rates structure failed to reflect this trend as the high retail lending rates persisted. The average maximum lending rate increased to 2332 percent in February, 2010 from 2318 per cent in the preceding month compared with 2345 and 231 per cent in December and November 2009, respectively. The average prime lending rate, on the other hand, declined marginally to 1828 per cent in February 2010 from 1838 per cent in January. It was 1903 and 1893 per cent, respectively, in December and November, 2009. The weighted average savings rate rose to 338 per cent in February 2010 from 333, 336 and 335 per cent in January 2010. December and November 2009, respectively. The consolidated deposit rate, which remained unchanged at 613 per cent in December 2009 and January 2010 dropped to 553 percent in February 2010. Thus the spread between the average maximum lending rate and the average consolidated deposit rate widened to 1779 per cent in February 2010 from 1705 per cent in January 2010 and 1734 per cent in December, 2009. The Committee noted that the key policy challenges remain the negative growth in credit to the private sector, high lending rates and widening interest rate spread despite the declining interbank rates and relative surplus liquidity in the banking system. Compared to the last quarter of 2009, the Nigerian capital market is showing signs of recovery. Market Capitalization (MC) also increased, by 321 per cent, from N498 trillion at end-December 2009 to N658 trillion on 7th April 2010. The number of deals, volume and value of shares traded increased by 1156, 1346 and 3261 per cent, respectively, during the review period. The increase in ASI and MC was partly due to share price increases in the Banking. Food & Beverage and Oil/Gas sectors. The Committee welcomed the improvements in the stock market, and noted further prospects for continuing recovery with the passage of the Asset Management Corporation Bill. It however, emphasized that the recovery of the capital market does not necessarily translate to economic recovery as the reforms initiated in the other sectors of the economy needed to be carried through in order to grow the economy. The Committee, therefore, called for the political will and commitment to see these reforms through. External Sector Developments: The foreign exchange market remained relatively stable in the first three months of 2010. At the WDAS, the review period opened with an exchange rate of N14908/US$1 (1% commission inclusive) and closed at N14978/US$1, with an average closing rate of N14994/US$1 for the quarter. When compared with the average closing rate of N14687/US$1 recorded during the first quarter of 2009, this represented a depreciation of N307 (205 percent). The average exchange rate depreciated marginally at the inter-bank market from N15035/$ in the fourth quarter of 2009 to N15043/$ in the first quarter of 2010. In the same vein, the premium between the WDAS average exchange rate and the inter-bank market rate 7 remained low at N198/$ (131%) in the first quarter of 2010, while that between the WDAS average exchange rate and the BDCs rate narrowed from N458 (30%) in the fourth quarter of 2009 to N402 (263%) in the first quarter of 2010. The Committee observed that the naira exchange rate has remained stable in all segments of the market during the first quarter and believes that if the current exchange rate policy stance of liberalizing the foreign exchange market, with a view to enhancing foreign exchange supply, remains in place, the relative stability in the foreign exchange market and the exchange rate, is likely to be sustained in the near term. The Committee will, however, continue to monitor developments in the market to ensure that measures are taken to eliminate speculative demand. The gross external reserves stood at US$4068 billion as at 31st March, 2010, representing a decrease of US$071 billion or 171 per cent relative to the level of US$4139 billion as at 28th February 2010. Although the Committee noted that the external reserves were sufficient to finance 17 months of imports, which were well above the internationally recommended 3-months import cover, it believed that with the rising price of crude oil in the international market in recent months, coupled with the improvement in output with peace in the Niger Delta, there is likely to be an improvement in the level of foreign exchange reserves in the near term. The Committee's Considerations The principal concerns of policy at this point in time were identified as the following: 8 1. Ensuring that the quantitative easing adopted by the Committee actually translate to injection of credit to the private sector players in the real economy; 2. Establishing some correspondence between the monetary policy rate (MPR) and prime and maximum lending rates of DMBs in order to establish a proper transmission channel from policy rate movements to market interest rates; and 3. Maintaining macroeconomic stability and stimulating growth while remaining vigilant with respect to inflation and capital market asset price bubbles. In considering the modalities for the restructuring/refinancing programme, the Committee was concerned about the need for a proper definition of SMEs that will not exclude many potential beneficiaries thereby limiting the effectiveness/impact of the intervention. In this regard, the MPC noted the existence of several definitions of SMEs, but felt that by providing a limit to the size of the loan per borrower from an institution more potential borrowers would be covered. The Committee also reviewed developments in the economy during the first quarter of 2010. The MPC noted with concern the persisting high lending rates despite the current low inter-bank and deposit rates, and as a consequence the wide spread between lending and deposit rates. This the Committee attributed to inefficiency in cost management and unrealistic profit expectations and targets. It believed that promoting transparency in the pricing and setting of rates by DMBs could help to drive down lending rates. In this regard. DMBs would be required to regularly publish and submit their 9 risk-based interest rate pricing model to the CBN. In addition, the banks would be required to provide a statement showing the relationship between the MPR and their prime and maximum lending rates. For the avoidance of doubt, the MPC will not fix lending and deposit rates by fiat. However every bank will be required to disclose the maximum spread it charges above the MPR to its prime customers and the risk premium it charges between prime and maximum lending rates. The pricing model would also disclose the basis for the spread and principal components covered. The articulation of the pricing model in this mode and its disclosure to the general public will serve two purposes. First by providing visibility on relative efficiency of financial institutions, banks will be encouraged to seek profitability by driving down costs and charging competitive rates rather than charging excessive rates of interest. Second by explicitly stating prime and maximum lending rates as a fixed spread over MPR, the policy rate becomes an effective tool for driving lending rates up or down as policy stance dictates. The MPC noted with satisfaction the existing macroeconomic conditions. In this regard, the Committee restated its commitment to monitoring developments in the economy and stands ready to take appropriate action when the need arises. 10 Decisions In the light of the above, the MPC: 1. Approved the technical committee's recommendations with respect to modalities for the Refinancing/Restructuring of DMBs facilities to manufacturers with N1Billion as the maximum loan size a bank may refinance for a single borrower. The guidelines will be released shortly. Directed that banks be required to submit their Risk-based Interest Rate Pricing Model to the Central Bank of Nigeria on a monthly basis which will be published. circular to this effect will be issued shortly. Loan pricing, henceforth be stated as fixed spread above MPR, and shall be adjusted along with MPR movements. Retained the MPR at 6 per cent and existing asymmetric corridor around the MPR at +20 per cent and -50 per cent. Endorsed complementary policies being put in place by the Board of the CBN, especially the revised guidelines for loan loss provisioning for preferred sectors, the N200 billion guarantee for real sector credit and regulations governing margin lending. Noted with satisfaction the progress of the AMCON Bill through the National legislature and urged the CBN to continue in its effort towards expedited passage of the Bill and speedy implementation.

Peru,2010-04-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2010 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 1.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 1.25 percent. The decision of maintaining monetary stimulus is made considering that the recent evolution of inflation is basically the result of the transitory impact of supply shocks and seasonal factors. Inflation in March recorded a rate of 0.28 percent, due mainly to the increase of the prices of education. With this, annual inflation went from 0.84 percent in February to 0.76 percent in March, below the lower band of the target range (1 percent  3 percent). Advanced indicators of economic activity show clear signs of a recovery of its dynamism, but no signals of inflationary pressures. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants to adopt preventive adjustments in the monetary policy stance in order to ensure that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 2.05 percent. Overnight deposits: 0.45 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for May on its session of May 6, 2010."
Philippines,2010-04-21,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision was based on the latest BSP baseline projections, which show that while inflation forecasts have somewhat risen, the inflation path remains within the target for 2010 and 2011. The Board noted that the second-round effects of supply-side pressures, notably from higher energy prices, are manageable at the moment, and inflation expectations are well-contained. In addition, while the global recovery is proceeding faster than expected, world economic activity remains dependent on macroeconomic stimulus policies, and therefore the self-sustaining nature of the global expansion remains to be seen. Current policy settings therefore remain appropriate. The Monetary Board also noted that the BSP's disengagement from crisis intervention measures should continue as economic conditions steadily show signs of improvement and as financial markets have remained stable. In the light of favorable credit and liquidity conditions, and to reduce potential inflationary risks, the Monetary Board decided to further reduce the peso rediscounting budget from P40 billion to the pre-crisis level of P20 billion, effective on 3 May 2010. At the same time, the Monetary Board observed that the balance of risks to future inflation is tilted to the upside because of supply-side factors. With growth expected to improve over the policy horizon and inflows from abroad anticipated to strengthen, monetary authorities resolve to remain vigilant against inflation pressures and are prepared to take timely and preemptive monetary policy actions to safeguard price stability."
Thailand,2010-04-21,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 21 April 2010 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Assistant Governor. Bank of Thailand, announces the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, as follows. The Thai economy shows sign of robust growth in the first quarter, driven by continued growth in exports, consumption and investment. The global economic recovery, improved confidence of the private sector, and strong economic fundamentals should provide a foundation for firm economic expansion this year. Nonetheless the heightened political risk is a key factor clouding the economic outlook at the moment. Macroeconomic stability remains favourable. Core inflation is low at present, but projected to rise in the periods ahead in line with economic expansion and increase in the costs of raw materials. External balances are strong, while the risk to financial stability is low. The MPC views the heightened political risk as a key factor affecting confidence, tourism, private consumption and investment. The MPC will closely monitor its impact on the economy, and has therefore decided to maintain the policy interest rate at 125 per cent for the time being."
Hungary,2010-04-26,"At its meeting on 26 April 2010, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 25 basis points from 5.50% to 5.25%, with effect from 27 April 2010. In the Monetary Council's judgement. Hungarian growth is likely to resume this year as the economy recovers from the sharp downturn of 2009. Inflation is expected to fall below the Bank's target next year, reflecting the effect of weak domestic demand. There remains considerable uncertainty about future conditions in global financial markets. The Hungarian economy is likely to continue to show the structural divergences in activity observed in 2009. Exports are expected to pick up, in contrast to domestic demand, which is unlikely to grow materially this year. In consequence, the recovery in the domestic economy is likely to lag behind that in the global economy and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Developments in the prices of products determining the medium-term outlook for inflation continue to reflect the downward effect on prices of weak domestic demand. Services inflation has been falling steadily for some time. The tradables price index fell in March for the second consecutive month. In light of these developments, the Council continues to judge that inflation may begin to fall back towards the target from the middle of this year and then dip below it next year. Global investor sentiment has improved further in the past month. This has also been reflected in the fall in risk premia on Hungarian financial assets. However, investor concerns over the sustainability of government debt in some euro area countries have remained, posing a threat to the persistence of the improvement in global conditions. The improvement in the country's external balance has led to a reduction in Hungary's earlier external vulnerability; however, its high aggregate indebtedness and generally weak indicators of economic activity continue to pose risks. In order to reduce the country's vulnerability to external shocks, it is particularly important to maintain a disciplined, long-term sustainable fiscal policy. Based on the above considerations, the Monetary Council has decided to lower the central bank base rate by 25 basis points. Even though justified by the outlook for inflation and the economy, interest rates may only be reduced further if changes in perceptions about the risks associated with the economy allow it."
Israel,2010-04-26,"26.04.2010 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for May 2010 unchanged at 1.5 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for May 2010 will remain unchanged at 1.5 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The CPI for March rose by 0.1 percent, in line with the forecasts. The housing component rose by 0.6 percent, following three months of decline that totaled about 2 percent. In the last twelve months the CPI rose by 3.2 percent, and excluding the effect of the changes in indirect taxes and the water surcharge, by 2.7 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Forecasters expect that inflation as reflected in the CPI in the next twelve months (April 2010 to March 2011) will average 2.7 percent; and on average they expect inflation in 2010 to be 1.8 percent. They forecast that with the publication of the April index, inflation measured over the previous twelve months will return towithin the target range. Inflation expectations for the next twelve monthscalculated from the capital market declined from close to the upper limit of the target inflation range to 2.7 percent. With regard to the Bank of Israel interest rate, the forecasters expect, on average, an increase of 0.3 percentage points over the next three months, and a rate of 3.0 percent in a year's time. Expectations calculated from the capital market are for an interest rate of 2.6 percent in a year's time. Real economic activity: Many indicators show that the expansion of real economic activity is continuing, but some show that the rate of increase has slowed. On the positive side, the Bank of Israel's Companies Survey for the first quarter of 2010 shows that business activity continued to expand, and the leading index in the Survey reflects expectations of furtherexpansion in the second quarter, and foreign trade data for March point torenewed acceleration in goods imports and exports. The Bank of Israel composite state-of-the-economy index for April rose by 0.6 percent. In contrastto these indications, the rate of increase of direct and indirect tax revenues moderated somewhat, the expectations component of consumers' confidence indices declined, and the probability of a slowdown in demand in April increased (based on the Google search index calculated in the Bank's ResearchDepartment). The Bank of Israel's forecast of growth in 2010 was revised upwards last week from 3.5 percent to 3.7 percent, and the forecast for 2011 is of 4 percent growth. The labor market and wages: The various labor market indicators taken together suggest a gradual improvement. Seasonally adjusted National Insurance Institute figures show that the number of employee posts in January 2010 was 0.5 percent higher than in December, and 1.9 percent higher thanin January 2009. The real wage fell by 1.7 percent in the period November 2009 to January 2010 compared with the same period a year previously, the nominal wage increased by 2 percent, and the number of employee posts increased by 0.2 percent. The upward trend in health tax receipts that started inJuly 2009 continued in March. Budget data: In the first quarter of 2010 the domestic deficit was NIS 1.9 billion, compared with NIS 3.8 billion in the first quarter of 2009. In the first quarter of the years 2005-08, however, there was abudget surplus. The deficit in the first quarter of 2010 is NIS 2 billion lower than that given by the seasonal path consistent with the budget deficit ceiling. This deviation from the path is due mainly to the fact that taxrevenues were NIS 2.5 billion higher than in the budget forecast. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the previous monetary policy discussions of March 25 and April 25, the shekel appreciatedby 0.2 percent against the dollar, and by 0.9 percent against the euro. Nevertheless, in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel depreciated marginally, by 0.1 percent, as a result of the strengthening of the other currencies included in the currency basket against which the rate is calculated. During the month the euro continued to weaken against most major currencies, in light of Greece's debt crisis. The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of March 25 and April 25, the Tel Aviv 25 index and the Tel Aviv 100 index both dropped by 1.9 percent. This was in contrast to the positive trend in the major stock markets. In the course of the period, the Tel Aviv 25 index surpassed its previous peak level, but as stated, at the end of the period it declined. The yields on Israeli government bonds were relatively stable this month, with a slight flattening of the nominal and indexed yield curves. The yield gap between Israeli and US unindexed 10-year government bonds widened again this month, by 15 b.p., to 115 b.p. There was continued lively interest in makam, also among foreign investors, who continued to expand their activity in the primary market and also in the secondary market, which recorded high levels of trade. Yields to all terms increased by about 15-25 b.p. this month along the entire curve Over the period the Tel-Bond 20 index and the Tel-Bond 40 index edged down by about 0.1 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, declined, in line with the reductions in the premiums of the emerging market economies, and reached 109 b.p, a drop of about 7 basis points from the previous month. The money supply: The M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 2.4 percent in March, following its decline of 1.8 percent in February. The M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits up to one year) declined by 0.8 percent in March, further to its fall of 1.4 percent in February. The credit market: Outstanding business sector bank credit increased in February by 0.9 percent, to NIS 389 billion. Total business sector debt grew by 0.7 percent in February, to NIS 737 billion. New mortgages granted increased again in March, to NIS 3.6 billion. The world economy: The recovery trend in the global economy continued this month. Most incoming data indicate that the recovery in the global economy is becoming more firmly entrenched, due in part to the continued strong growth in East Asian countries and positive signs of recovery in theUS. Against this background the IMF revised its growth forecast upwards. Reports also showed that the probability of the start of another recession has receded. Nevertheless, in the advanced countries, growth is heavily influenced by extremely expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. The exit from these policies could pose a threat to the strength of the recovery. Additional risks persist, particularly the global debt crisis, which became evenmore severe towards the end of the period, against the background of Greece's debt crisis. The monetary policy of the main central banks continues tobe expansionary. Concurrently, in other countries the trend towards a tighter monetary policy persists. Nonetheless, global inflation is still low, and there is no concern over an inflationary spurt in the coming year. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for May unchanged at 1.5 percent is part of the gradual process of returning interest to a more normal level, intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to contribute to the further recovery of economic activity, while supporting financial stability. The path of the interest rate will be determined in accordance with the inflation environment, the entrenchment of growth in Israeland globally, the rate at which the major central banks increase their interest rates, and in light of developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. At the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues tobe expansionary. The inflation rate over the past twelve months declined to 3.2 percent, and since the beginning of 2010 the price level has declined by 0.9 percent. Seasonally adjusted and excluding the reduction in indirect taxes and the abolition of the water surcharge, inflation since the beginning of the year was 0.6 percent. It is expected that after the publication of the April CPI, inflation over the previous twelve months will enter the target range and later in the year is even expected to fall below the midpoint of the range. Inflation expectations calculated from the capital market declined to 2.7 percent, after several months when they rose slowly and were close to the upper limit of the target range. Forecasters' predictions of inflation one year ahead remained stable at an average of 2.7 percent. Data that became available this month, in particular the Bank of Israel Companies Survey and foreign trade data, support the assessment that economic growth in Israel is becoming more firmly entrenched. At the same time, according to the updated Bank of Israel forecast, the process of closing the output gap isexpected to be a gradual one. Interest rates of the central banks of the leading advanced economies are very low, and are expected to remain so during the coming months. Nonetheless, some ofthem are continuing to reduce their use of unconventional instruments of monetary accommodation, and other central banks are starting to increase their interest rates. These three factors support a gradual increase in the interest rate, andtherefore, following the increase in the rate last month, the Governor decided to leave the interest rate unchanged for May. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic and financial developments, and will use the instruments available to itto achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on May 10, 2010. The decision regarding the interest rate for June 2010 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. May 24, 2010. 26.04.2010 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for May 2010 unchanged at 1.5 percent. The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for May 2010 unchanged at 1.5 percent. The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for May 2010 will remain unchanged at 1.5 percent. Background conditions. Inflation data: The CPI for March rose by 0.1 percent, in line with the forecasts. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for May unchanged at 1.5 percent is part of the gradual process of returning interest to a more normal level, intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to contribute to the further recovery of economic activity, while supporting financial stability."
Poland,2010-04-28,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 28 April 2010 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 27-28 April 2010 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate at 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) discount rate at 4.00% on an annual basis. Further signs of recovery are appearing in the world economy, even though the scale of improvement in economic activity varies across regions. In developed economies the recovery is proceeding at a relatively slow pace and  as expected in a post-recession period  is mainly observed in manufacturing. In the United States, a gradual revival in consumption demand is recorded alongside some signals pointing to improvement in the labour market situation. In the euro area, economic activity remains weak in most sectors and labour market developments are still unfavourable. At the same time, fast economic growth is recorded in the largest emerging economies. The ensuing risk of increasing economic imbalances leads to a gradual macroeconomic policy tightening in those countries. The signs of recovery are conducive to the growth of commodity prices, including oil prices. High annual growth of energy prices, which also results from a low reference base, is raising the annual inflation rate in developed countries, though core inflation indices remain at low levels in those countries. The negative consequences  mainly those related to public debt accumulation  of strongly expansionary macroeconomic policies, which have so far supported the global economic recovery, are becoming more and more evident. The fiscal crisis in Greece is increasing the uncertainty in international financial markets. The data on the Polish economy in 2010 Q1 indicate a continuing economic recovery in some sectors, including primarily a significant rise in activity in industry. At the same time, 2010 Q1 brought a strong fall in the construction and assembly output. After a two-month decline mainly related to  similarly as in the case of the construction output  unfavourable weather conditions, in March the growth of retail sales increased. Consumer confidence indicators are still improving together with enterprises' expectations with regard to economic conditions  among others, expectations about demand, including foreign demand for Polish goods. After a decline in investment in 2009 Q4, currently most enterprises do not envisage an increase in their investment activity, though at the same time they do not reduce their previous investment plans, which is a favourable development in comparison to previous quarters. A slight employment rise in the enterprise sector, stabilisation of the unemployment rate (adjusted for seasonal factors), an increase in the number of new vacancies and accelerated wage growth in March 2010 as well as enterprises' ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, expectations concerning their employment level and pay rises may all signal a gradual deceleration of the unfavourable labour market tendencies. Bank loans to enterprises continue to fall, which is primarily due to low demand for credit on the part of large enterprises. At the same time, the latest data point to some recovery in lending to households. The recovery is particularly visible in housing loans. In line with expectations, in March 2010 annual CPI inflation decreased again (to 2.6%) approaching the level of the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. The inflation decline was largely driven by lower annual growth of food prices. At the same time core inflation continued to decrease. In line with available forecasts, in the months to come the annual CPI will still be lowered by negative base effects connected with the surge in the prices of excise goods and food prices in 2009. Other factors conducive to lower inflation include: currently low demand pressure, the hitherto considerable zloty appreciation and moderate growth of labour costs. In turn, inflation decline in 2010 may be curbed by rises in commodity prices in the world markets as well as by persistently elevated growth of some administered prices, including the prices of energy carriers and services related to house maintenance. On 9 April 2010, the National Bank of Poland purchased a certain amount of foreign currencies in the market. This operation was consistent with the Monetary Policy Guidelines for the Year 2010. In the Council's assessment the probabilities of inflation running below or above the inflation target in the medium term are balanced. An important factor affecting monetary policy is the situation of the public finance sector. Introducing measures aimed at permanently reducing the deficit of the general government sector and at curbing the increase of the public debt will support macroeconomic stability and allow to meet the criteria for euro adoption. The Council maintains the opinion that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organisational conditions. The Council adopted the financial statement of the National Bank of Poland for the year 2009."
United States,2010-04-28,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market is beginning to improve. Growth in household spending has picked up recently but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly; however, investment in nonresidential structures is declining and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Housing starts have edged up but remain at a depressed level. While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth. Although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for a time, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability. With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability. In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve has closed all but one of the special liquidity facilities that it created to support markets during the crisis. The only remaining such program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, is scheduled to close on June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities; it closed on March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A Duke; Donald L Kohn; Sandra Pianalto; Eric S Rosengren; Daniel K Tarullo; and Kevin M Warsh. Voting against the policy action was Thomas M Hoenig, who believed that continuing to express the expectation of exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period was no longer warranted because it could lead to a build-up of future imbalances and increase risks to longer run macroeconomic and financial stability, while limiting the Committee's flexibility to begin raising rates modestly."
Romania,2010-05-04,"In its meeting of May 4, 2010, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for May 6, 2010. The analysis of developments in macroeconomic indicators reveals a continued disinflation and an annual upward dynamics in exports as well as a current account deficit which remains at sustainable levels. At the same time, aggregate demand deficit and the declining annual lending to the private sector both persist. The annual inflation rate dropped to 4.2 percent in March from 4.47 percent in February, coming down within the variation band around the target, mainly due to the favourable trends in food prices against the background of relatively low volatility of the leu exchange rate. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation1 slid further, remaining below two percent. In the monetary area, it is worth noting the continued downward trend of average interest rates on various segments of the domestic financial market following the successive cuts in the monetary policy rate and an improvement of liquidity in the banking system, while the adjustment of interest rates applied by credit institutions to non-bank customers is ongoing. The monetary policy stance was aimed at ensuring real broad monetary conditions appropriate for a convergence of inflation towards medium-term objectives as well as for the sustainable revival of lending in the Romanian economy. The updated forecast shows a continuation of disinflation but also a relative heightening of domestic risks related to the fulfilment of fiscal and incomes policy objectives in the public sector and of uncertainties related to developments in external markets amid recent tensions regarding the public finance crisis in Greece. These factors may complicate the recovery prospects for the Romanian economy. In this context, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 6.25 percent per annum from 6.5 percent. Consequently, starting May 5, 2010, the rate on the deposit facility will be lowered to 2.25 percent per annum from 2.5 percent and the rate on the lending facility (Lombard) will be 10.25 percent per annum versus 10.5 percent. At the same time, the penalty rate for deficits of leu-denominated minimum reserve requirements will drop to 15.5 percent starting with the May 24-June 23, 2010, maintenance period. The NBR Board has also decided to pursue an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu-denominated and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses evolutions in the recent macroeconomic environment and the inflation outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for May 6, 2010. The NBR Board reaffirms that further compliance with commitments set under the multilateral external financing arrangement with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions would ensure a consistent implementation of the macroeconomic policy mix, which is essential for achieving sustainable disinflation, maintaining financial stability and restarting a lasting economic recovery. The NBR will continue to closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so that, by using its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. According to the calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for June 30, 2010. 1) The adjusted annual CORE2 inflation rate is calculated by the NBR by excluding the administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) as well as prices of tobacco and alcohol from the headline consumer price index."
Czech Republic,2010-05-06,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 3rd Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments May 6, 2010 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast Six out of seven Bank Board members attended the meeting. At the close of the meeting the Bank Board decided by a majority vote to lower the two-week repo rate by 0.25 percentage point to 0.75 %. At the same time, it decided to cut the Lombard rate by the same amount, to 1.75 %. Four board members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for leaving interest rates unchanged. Reasons for the decision Headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation will be slightly below the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon. Consistent with the forecast is initially a moderate decline in market interest rates followed by stability and gradual rise in rates since 2011. The message of the forecast Headline inflation will rise during 2010 and will exceed the CNB's target at the end of the year due to already realized indirect taxes changes. In 2011 inflation will decline slightly below the CNB‘s inflation target. Monetary-policy relevant inflation will initially be lower than headline inflation and will be approaching the target from below over the monetary policy horizon (2011 Q2 and Q3). GDP will grow over the entire forecast horizon, but the growth rate in 2010 will be hampered by a temporary decline in domestic consumption and slowdown in foreign demand. Both factors will unwind in 2011 and GDP growth will start to accelerate. Nominal exchange rate is gradually appreciating over the forecast horizon. Consistent with the forecast is initially a moderate decline in market interest rates followed by stability and a gradual rise in rates since 2011. Upside risk relates to exchange rate developments Downside risk stems from the global economic outlook with respect to Czech exports. Uncertainty going in both directions exists regarding current financial market developments in connection with the fiscal situation. 13 Thank you for your attention More information about the forecast can be found at _policy/forecast/ and in Inflation Report II/2010, to be published 14th May, 2010."
Euroarea,2010-05-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference here in Lisbon. I would like to thank Governor Constâncio for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Taking into account all new information since our meeting on 8 April 2010, we expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. Global inflationary pressures  driven mainly by price developments in commodity markets and in fast-growing economic regions of the world  are still being counteracted by low domestic price pressures. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010. We expect the euro area economy to expand at a moderate pace in 2010, but growth patterns could be uneven in an environment of high uncertainty. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Monetary policy will do all that is necessary to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009, after a period of sharp decline. Notably, the economy has benefited from the ongoing recovery in the world economy, the significant macroeconomic stimulus provided and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the banking system. Recent economic data  including positive survey indicators  support the view that the economic recovery in the euro area is continuing in 2010. While adverse weather conditions, in particular, dampened growth in the early part of the year, some strengthening appears to be taking place during the spring. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects real GDP to expand at a moderate pace. The ongoing recovery at the global level, and its impact on the demand for euro area exports, should provide support to the euro area economy. At the same time, the financial crisis is expected to have a dampening effect on economic growth given the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and the expectation of low capacity utilisation and weak labour market prospects. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced, in an environment of high uncertainty. On the upside, the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected and confidence may improve more than expected, with the result that the recovery becomes self-sustained. On the downside, concerns remain relating to renewed tensions in some financial market segments. In addition, a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and the intensification of protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances, may weigh on the downside. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.5% in April 2010, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 1.4% in March. This is somewhat higher than expected a few months ago and appears to be related, in particular, to upward pressure in energy prices. Looking ahead, global inflationary pressures may increase, driven mainly by price developments in commodity markets and in fast-growing economic regions of the world, while euro area domestic price pressures are still expected to remain contained. As a result, overall inflation rates are expected to be moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In the near term, given the developments in energy prices, risks to earlier projections for HICP inflation are tilted somewhat towards the upside, while risks to price stability over the medium term are viewed as still remaining broadly balanced. Upside risks over the medium term relate, in particular, to the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. Overall, we need to monitor closely the future evolution of all available price indicators. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 remained slightly negative, at -0.1%, in March 2010. Together with the continued negative annual growth in loans to the private sector  -0.2% in March  the latest data further support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that the inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. Shorter-term developments in M3 and loans have also remained muted. The actual growth in M3 is seen as weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion, as the rather steep yield curve continues to foster the allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside M3. At the same time, the still narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different M3 instruments imply low opportunity costs of allocating funds to overnight deposits rather than other M3 instruments. This is reflected in the continued marked difference between weak annual growth in M3 and strong annual growth in M1, which was 10.9% in March. However, with the current interest rate constellation already in place for some time, the latest data suggest that the large shifts in the allocations of funds are waning. The annual growth of bank loans to the private sector remained negative in March, but this conceals a further positive monthly flow. It also conceals ongoing opposite developments at the sectoral level, with positive, increasing annual growth in loans to households on the one side, and negative annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations on the other side. While the lagged response of loans to non-financial corporations to economic activity is a normal feature of the business cycle, the data over the past few months point to a possible discontinuation of the earlier downward trend in annual loan growth. The latest data also confirm that the reduction in the size of banks' overall balance sheets has not continued since the turn of the year. However, further adjustments cannot be ruled out and the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up. To address this challenge, banks should turn to the market and use present funding conditions to strengthen further their capital bases. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all new information since our meeting on 8 April 2010, we expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon. Global inflationary pressures  driven mainly by price developments in commodity markets and in fast-growing economic regions of the world  are still being counteracted by low domestic price pressures. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the early months of 2010. We expect the euro area economy to expand at a moderate pace in 2010, but growth patterns could be uneven in an environment of high uncertainty. A cross- check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Monetary policy will do all that is necessary to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. As regards fiscal policies, we call for decisive actions by governments to achieve a lasting and credible consolidation of public finances. The latest information shows that the correction of the large fiscal imbalances will, in general, require a stepping-up of current efforts. Fiscal consolidation will need to exceed substantially the annual structural adjustment of 0.5% of GDP set as a minimum requirement by the Stability and Growth Pact. The longer the fiscal correction is postponed, the greater the adjustment needs become and the higher the risk of reputational and confidence losses. Instead, the swift implementation of frontloaded and comprehensive consolidation plans, focusing on the expenditure side and combined with structural reforms, will strengthen public confidence in the capacity of governments to regain sustainability of public finances, reduce risk premia in interest rates and thus support sustainable growth over the medium term. In this context, the Governing Council welcomes the economic and financial adjustment programme which was approved by the Greek government following the successful conclusion of the negotiations with the European Commission, in liaison with the ECB, and the International Monetary Fund, with a view to safeguarding financial stability in the euro area as a whole. For all euro area countries, structural reforms leading to higher growth and employment are crucial to support a sustainable recovery. In view of the recent rise in unemployment, tax and benefit systems that set effective incentives to work, improved training schemes and sufficient flexibility in labour contracts are required in order to avoid an increase in structural unemployment. At the same time, existing competitiveness problems, as well as domestic and external imbalances, need to be urgently addressed by the countries concerned. To that end, wage-bargaining institutions that allow wages to adjust appropriately to losses in competitiveness and the unemployment situation are indispensable. Likewise, measures that increase price flexibility and non-price competitiveness are essential. Finally, an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks' resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability."
Egypt,2010-05-06,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release May 6, 2010 In its meeting held on May 6, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 825 percent and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 85 percen. Annual headline CPI declined to 1220 percent in March compared to 1278 percent registered in February 2010, yet remains elevated reflecting the impact of last year's unfavorable shock related to fruits and vegetable. In the meantime, annual core CPI inched up to 704 percent in March from 690 percent in February and remains within the CBE's comfort zon. Meanwhile annual real GDP growth recorded 5 percent in 2009/10 Q2 compared to the four year low of 41 percent witnessed in 2008/09 Q2, reflecting a steady improvement in economic activit. Furthermore the ongoing recovery in the global economy coupled with the domestic fiscal and monetary measures undertaken so far will continue to provide a conducive environment for the domestic econom. Against this background, the MPC assesses that inflationary pressures remain subdued and that the current level of policy interest rate is appropriate and supportive of the economic recovery while consistent with maintaining core inflation within the CBE's comfort zone in the medium-ter. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Nigeria,2010-05-10,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 70 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. May 10-11, 2010 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 10th and 11th May, 2010 to review domestic economic conditions during the first four months of 2010 and the challenges facing the Nigerian economy against the backdrop of developments in the international economic and financial environments in order to reassess the course for monetary policy for the remainder of the year. On the global scene, the Committee noted that the recovery in global economic activity, which started in the second half of 2009, has evolved better than expected although large fiscal deficits continue to pose a threat. The recovery, which was driven largely by the unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy stimuli undertaken in both the developed and emerging market economies in response to the global economic slowdown, was progressing at varying degrees across the different regions. In the advanced economies, recovery is progressing. Among emerging and developing economies. Asia is taking the lead although growth is solidifying in key Latin American countries. Sub-Saharan African countries have thus far, weathered the global crisis well, and their recoveries are expected to be stronger than in previous global downturns. Across the globe, real and financial activities have been mutually supportive in their recovery. Although the money markets have stabilized, and corporate bond and equity markets have rebounded, access to credit remained difficult for some sectors, especially small firms and households 1 that lack access to the capital markets. Although the tightening of bank lending standards and the credit crisis appear to be bottoming out, the resumption of credit growth in many emerging and developing countries has been weak. In the advanced economies, eroded bank capital is likely to remain a constraint on growth as banks continue to repair their balance sheets. In a few advanced economies, particularly the Euro area, rising public sector deficits and debts accumulated in the wake of the crises as part of measures to stimulate growth, have heightened sovereign risk premia, thereby posing additional risks to the recovery process. The MPC observed that the domestic financial markets have recovered remarkably faster than expected, though still fragile, and urged greater efforts in accelerating the reforms in the different segments of the financial system to promote financial sector stability which is critical to economic growth. In particular, deep and liquid capital markets and strong and effective insurance companies, pension funds and other institutional investors are critical for establishing the balance required for the attainment of financial system stability. While noting that financial market inefficiencies and supervisory and regulatory failures were at the root of the current crisis, it welcomed the relative stability that has been achieved in most segments of the market in response to the various measures taken by the regulatory authorities and emphasized the need for its sustenance. The MPC also noted the continuing rebound in commodity prices, particularly crude oil prices, which is helping to support growth in commodity producing regions, including Nigeria. However the inflation risk of the rebound in energy prices appears to be mitigated by the subsisting low 2 levels of capacity utilization, weak private demand and well-anchored inflation expectations. Key Domestic Macroeconomic and Financial Developments Output and Prices: The Committee observed that the robust output growth recorded in 2009 continued in 2010. Provisional data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicates that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 668 per cent in the first quarter of 2010, down from 744 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2009, but up from the 450 per cent recorded in the first quarter of 2009. NBS also projected that the GDP is expected to grow by 724, 736 and 851 per cent in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2010, respectively. Overall GDP growth for 2010 was projected at 753 per cent which is higher than the revised estimate of 666 per cent recorded in 2009. The non-oil sector is expected to remain the main driver of overall growth, with agriculture, wholesale and retail trade, and services contributing 261, 209 and 214 per cent, respectively. The Committee noted that the impressive growth forecasts reflect prospects for moderate rainfall in 2010, which is expected to support the production of major crops across the country, and the sustained peace in the Niger-Delta, which would boost crude oil and natural gas production. The MPC, however, noted that at a mere 4 percent share of GDP, the manufacturing sector needed revamping to enhance its role in boosting growth and employment generation. In this context, it called for appropriate sector-specific policies to drive manufacturing growth. The year-on-year headline inflation rose from 120 per cent in the last quarter of 2009 to stabilize at 123 per cent in January and February 2010 and declined to 118 per cent in March 2010. Similarly core inflation rose from 97 percent in the last quarter of 2009 to stabilize at 101 per cent in January and February 2010, before declining to 95 per cent in March 2010. The downward trend in the domestic price level could be attributed to a number of factors, including the continuing underperformance of monetary aggregates, with the associated constrained demand, availability of food stuff, and improvement in the supply of petroleum products, amongst others. Notwithstanding these developments, the Committee restated its earlier position that the threat of inflationary pressure in the near-to-medium term remains real given the expansionary stance of the 2010 Federal Government budget and the anticipated increase in spending usually associated with the run-up to election across the country. In this regard, the MPC confirmed that it will continue to monitor price developments in the months ahead with a view to ensuring that the downside risk of inflation to growth is minimized. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments: Provisional data showed that relative to end-December 2009, broad money (M2) grew by 23 per cent at end-March 2010, which, when annualized represented a growth of 902 per cent, compared to the indicative growth target of 2926 per cent for 2010. Reserve money (RM), which stood at N1,,66850 billion at end-December 2009, declined to N1,,57433 billion and N 1,,63660 billion in January and February 2010, respectively, but rose to N 1, 78221 billion in March 2010. As at April 27, 2010, the RM level of N1, 4971 billion was below the provisional 2010 second quarter indicative benchmark of N1, 87280 billion by N37552 billion or 2006 per cent. Available data showed that in March 2010, aggregate domestic credit (net) grew by 61 per cent over the December 2009 level, and by 245 per cent when annualized, which is far below the 2010 indicative target of 5554 per cent. Credit to government (net), which grew by 284 per cent (or 1136 per cent on annualized basis), was the major contributor to the growth in aggregate credit (net) in March 2010, as credit to the private sector declined, by 17 per cent ( or 68 per cent on annualized basis). The annualized growth rate of credit to the private sector of -68 per cent was far below the provisional growth benchmark of 3154 per cent for 2010. The substantial growth of credit to government (net) reflects the risk aversion of the DMBs to lending to non-government borrowers, implying the crowding out of private sector credit. During the first four months of 2010, the downward trend in interest rates in the domestic money market, which began in July 2009, following the Bank's decision to guarantee interbank transactions, continued. The low rates provide ample evidence of sufficient liquidity and restored confidence in the money market. The weighted average interbank call rate, which was 289 per cent as at end-December 2009, declined to 248, 217, and 150 per cent in January. February and March 2010, respectively. The downward trend continued to 127 per cent on April 30, 2010. Similarly the securitized open-buy-back (OBB) rate, which was 264 per cent at end-December 2009, declined to 246, 220, and 131 per cent in January. February and March 2010, respectively. The rate further declined to 111 per cent on April 30, 2010, compared with the monetary policy rate (MPR) of 600 per cent and Standing Deposit Facility rate of 10 per cent. The falling interbank rates appear to reflect marginally on the DMBs' lending rates. The retail lending rates have started declining albeit by far lower magnitudes than the decline in inter bank rates. The average maximum lending rate dropped to 2288 percent in March 2010 from 2332 and 2318 per cent in February and January 2010, respectively. The rate was 2345 per cent in December 2009. Also the average prime lending rate dropped to 1806 per cent in March 2010 from 1828 and 1838 per cent in February and January 2010, respectively. In December 2009 the rate was 1903 per cent. Similarly the weighted average savings rate dropped to 320 per cent in March 2010, from 333 per cent in January 2010 and 338 percent in February. As at end-December 2009, the average savings rate stood at 336 per cent. The consolidated deposit rates declined to 388 percent in March 2010, down from 544 per cent in February and 613 percent in January 2010. As at end-December 2009, the consolidated rate was 613 per cent. Despite the decline in deposit rates, the spread between the average maximum lending rate and the consolidated deposit rate widened to 1899 percentage points in March 2010, up from 1788, 1705 and 1734 percentage points in February and January, 2010, and December 2009, respectively. The Committee noted that the key policy challenges remain the negative growth in credit to the private sector, and subsisting high lending rates in the face of declining inter-bank rates and relative liquidity surfeit in the banking system. Compared to the last quarter of 2009, the Nigerian capital market is recovering. Market Capitalization (MC) also increased, by 283 per cent, from N498 trillion at end-December 2009 to N639 trillion over the same period. The number of deals, volume and value of shares traded increased by 581, 877 and 2160 per cent, respectively, during the review period. The increase in ASI and MC was partly due to share price increases in the Banking. Food & Beverage and Oil/Gas sectors. The Committee welcomed the continuing improvement in the stock market, and noted the potentials for further recovery with the passage of the Asset Management Corporation (AMCON) Bill. It however, emphasized that the recovery of the capital market does not necessarily translate to economic recovery as the reforms initiated in other sectors of the economy needed to be carried through to complement financial sector reforms in order to grow the economy. The Committee would, however, continue to monitor the recovery of the capital market to ensure that a bubble is not once again being formed. External Sector Developments: The foreign exchange market remained relatively stable in the first four months of 2010. At the WDAS, the review period opened with an exchange rate of N14908/US$1 and closed at N15010/US$1, with an average closing rate of N14992/US$1 for the period. When compared with the average closing rate of N14736/US$1 recorded in April 2009, this represented a depreciation of N256 (0017 per cent). The average exchange rate depreciated at the inter-bank market from N15035/$ in the fourth quarter of 2009 to N15080/$ in April 2010. The premium between the average WDAS closing rate of N14994/US$1 and the average selling rate of N15080/US$1 7 at the inter-bank foreign exchange market widened to N086/US$1 (057 per cent), from N051/US$1 (035 per cent) recorded in the first quarter of 2009, while that between the WDAS average exchange rate and the BDCs rate narrowed to N253/US$1 (169 per cent), from N1361/US$1 (927 per cent) in the first four months of 2009. The Committee observed that the naira exchange rate has remained stable in all segments of the market during the review period, reflecting increased confidence in the Naira and the efficacy of the current exchange rate policy stance of liberalizing the foreign exchange market which has enhanced foreign exchange supply from autonomous sources. It believes that the relative stability in the foreign exchange market is likely to be sustained in the near term. The Committee will, however, continue to monitor developments in the market to ensure that measures are taken to eliminate speculative demand and volatility in the market. The gross external reserves stood at US$4031 billion as at 30th April, 2010, representing a marginal decrease of US$037 billion or 091 per cent relative to the level of US$4068 billion as at 31st March 2010. The MPC noted that although the level of external reserves were sufficient to finance 17 months of current imports, which is well above the internationally recommended benchmark of 3-months import cover, it believed that with the rising price of crude oil in the international market in recent months, coupled with the improvement in output with peace in the Niger Delta, there is likely to be an accretion in the level of foreign exchange reserves in the near term. The Committee's Considerations The key concerns for policy in this era of global recovery were identified as follows: 1. Ensuring that the growing risk of fiscal deficit accumulated in the wake of the abating global financial and economic crises does not endanger the stability of financial markets. In most of the affected countries, the huge fiscal deficits arose not only from increased spending but also from reduced revenues, thus suggesting the need for greater focus on revenue generation in the finances of government. Monitoring imbalances in capital flows across industrial and emerging markets resulting in different rates of recovery. This is to ensure that inflows of capital into the country are sustainable and thus avoid formation of asset price bubbles. The continuing global credit crunch despite unprecedented measures taken by central banks to inject liquidity in troubled financial institutions/markets. This underscores the need for focus on both supply side (monetary) and demand side (fiscal factors) in unlocking the credit markets. With regards to the continuing credit crunch, the MPC reemphasized that credit growth is a function of demand and supply factors. As the Central Bank is working to improve the supply side through the various reform measures to strengthen the DMBs' balance sheets, remove toxic assets, and generally repair the banking system to promote the flow of credit, the demand side would necessarily require critical reforms in the real sector, particularly power, energy, and key infrastructure to reduce the cost of doing business and improve investment climate to generate bankable projects. The MPC noted with satisfaction that, overall, the Bank has achieved its mandate of price and financial stability, as reflected in relatively stable exchange rates, interest rates and moderating inflation. By the time the 9 AMCON Bill is harmonized and finally passed by the National Assembly and implemented, the repair of banks' balance sheets would unlock the flow of credits to the real economy. In this regard, the MPC enjoins other stakeholders in government to undertake complementary measures to enable economic agents translate the stable macroeconomic environment into economic growth and development. Overall the Committee decided that there is a need to maintain and extend the focus on stability and avoid decision that may cause disruption. In view of the inflation outlook in the short-term, it was felt that the reversal of accommodative monetary stance at this time would be premature. The Committee however, noted that in the next quarter monetary expansion may be driven by increased government spending, the purchase of toxic assets by the AMCON and recapitalization of distressed banks. These expansions may translate into the risk of higher inflation, asset price bubbles or pressure on exchange rate and foreign reserves. The next MPC in July will assess these risks and take appropriate actions. Decisions In the light of the above, the MPC decided as follows: 1. Leave the MPR unchanged at 60 per cent. Retain the asymmetric corridor of interest rates at 200 basis points above the MPR and 500 basis points below the MPR for the Standing Lending Facility and Standing Deposit Facility, respectively 3. Extend the CBN guarantee for all interbank transactions and foreign credit lines as well as pension funds' placements with banks from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011. This is to provide ample time for the conclusion of the banking sector resolution and the publication 10 of audited accounts for the period up to December 2010. It is expected that by June 2011 all creditors and investors will have sufficient information to take an independent view of the risk of individual counterparties. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi Governor.

South Korea,2010-05-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. In the global economy, emerging market economies have sustained their favorable performance, while the economies of major advanced countries such as the US and Japan have shown an improving trend. There is, however, an underlying risk that the international financial markets may be destabilized at any time, because no fundamental solution of government debt problems in certain Southern European countries has yet been reached. The trend of recovery in domestic economic activity has become more evident. Even though construction investment has still been inactive, exports have sustained their buoyancy, and facilities investment and consumption have steadily increased. Labor market conditions have improved, led by the private sector. This recovery trend is expected to be maintained. Considering the overseas risk factors, however, there still remains uncertainty as to the economic growth path. Consumer price inflation has accelerated temporarily, driven by the rise in farm and fisheries product prices due to unseasonably cold weather. It is anticipated to be stable for some time, but the demand-pull pressure is expected to increase due to the recovery in economic activity. In the real estate market, housing sales prices have exhibited weakness, dragged down by prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas, with transactions remaining inactive. In the financial markets, with the expanded inflows of foreign portfolio investments, long-term and short-term market interest rates have decreased, however, the volatility of price variables has greatly expanded in response to the government debt problems in certain Southern European countries. The scale of the increase in mortgage lending has remained almost unchanged, due to lackluster house transactions, even though lending interest rates have declined. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain the accommodative policy stance in such a way as to help sustain the trend of recovery in economic activity, and in carrying out policy, it will take overall account of financial and economic conditions at home and abroad."
Chile,2010-05-13,"Central Bank of Chile Press Release* Santiago, 13 May 2010 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50% (annual). Internationally, the high volatility of the markets has been mitigated by fiscal announcements and financial support measures in Europe. Global growth prospects continue to be favorable, but the effects of recent financial turbulences on world output are still uncertain. The prices of copper and oil have declined, but are still at historic highs. Domestically, available information on economic activity suggests that the immediate effects of the earthquake exceeded earlier estimates. Demand indicators, meanwhile, show more dynamism than expected in the March Monetary Policy Report. Lending conditions have continued normalizing. Unemployment has kept on falling. In April, the CPI posted a somewhat smaller increase than had been forecast by the market, while longer term private inflation expectations are consistent with the last Report's baseline scenario. The Board considers that the time to begin the process of monetary policy normalization is approaching. At the same time, it reiterates that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Malaysia,2010-05-13,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to raise the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 2.50 percent. The floor and ceiling rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly raised to 2.25 percent and 2.75 percent respectively. The global economy registered a stronger than expected recovery in the first quarter, underpinned by favourable growth performance in emerging market economies and some of the advanced economies. Policy initiatives and improvements in financial conditions have continued to support the economic recovery in many countries. While economic activity in the advanced economies has generally improved, growth in these economies is still expected to remain modest. Considerable uncertainties remain due to heightened concerns over the sovereign debt problems in Europe and the expected diminishing effects of fiscal policy support. In the emerging market economies, in particular Asia, growth is expected to be stronger, supported by robust domestic demand and increased intra-regional trade. In the domestic economy, the strong and broad-based growth of 10.1% in the first quarter affirms that economic recovery is firmly established. Going forward, growth will be supported by continued expansion in domestic demand and the improvement in external demand, especially from the region. However, despite this upside potential to growth, there are uncertainties arising from recent developments in the international financial and economic environment. Domestic inflation recorded a modest increase during the first quarter and will continue to experience a gradual rise during the year, in line with broad-based improvements in economic activity and taking into account possible adjustments in administered prices. Although external factors, including rising global commodity and food prices, may exert some additional upward pressure on domestic prices, overall inflation is expected to remain moderate in 2010. The MPC decided to adjust the OPR towards further normalisation of monetary conditions. At the new level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy continues to remain accommodative and supportive of economic growth. Bank Negara Malaysia 13 May 2010."
South Africa,2010-05-13,"The risks to this relatively favourable growth outlook have changed somewhat in the past few days as a result of recent global developments. The uncertainty related to the sustainability of fiscal deficits in a number of euro area countries, and the reaction of the financial markets to these events, has renewed fears of possible contagion which could affect the tentative recovery that has been taking place in most regions, including in South Africa. The concerted efforts by European governments, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the IMF have had some effect on calming the markets. However, significant risks to the global and domestic recovery remain. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas declined to 5,1 per cent in March 2010 from 5,7 per cent in the previous month. The category of housing and utilities remained the single biggest driver of inflation, having contributed 1,6 percentage points, mainly as a result of the impact of a 26,8 per cent year-on-year increase in electricity prices. Food price inflation continued to contribute favourably to the average inflation outcome, having increased by 0,5 per cent. Administered prices excluding petrol and paraffin increased by 10,4 per cent, compared with 10,8 per cent in the previous month. Producer price inflation increased to 3,7 per cent in March 2010, compared with 3,5 per cent in February. This upward trend was driven mainly by primary commodity price increases that do not impact directly on the CPI. Food price inflation at the producer level remained well contained and should constrain food price inflation at the consumer price level in the coming months. Agricultural food prices declined at a year-on-year rate of 6,2 per cent, while manufactured food prices declined by 1,5 per cent. The CPI forecast of the South African Reserve Bank (the Bank) indicates a slightly improved outlook compared with that presented at the previous meeting of the MPC, with a lower projected inflation for 2010 and 2011. CPI inflation is still expected to reach a low point in the third quarter of 2010 when it is forecast to average 4,7 per cent. Inflation is then expected to increase moderately, and remain within the inflation target range until the end of the forecast period, which has been extended to the end of 2012, at 5,3 per cent. Recent surveys indicate that inflation expectations of analysts are within the inflation target range for most of the forecast period. According to the Reuters CPI survey, respondents expect inflation to average 5,3 per cent in 2010, and 5,8 per cent and 6,0 per cent in the following two years. Inflation expectations as indicated by inflation-linked bonds also reflect an improvement since the previous meeting of the MPC, and are within the inflation target range. According to the World Economic Outlook published by the IMF in April, global growth is now expected to average 4,2 per cent in 2010, compared with the October 2009 forecast of 3,1 per cent. However the recent developments in Europe have raised the possibility of a renewed crisis that could threaten the global recovery. The reaction of the financial markets to the downgrading by the rating agencies of some euro area countries was reminiscent of the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Apprehension about a possible default on Greek sovereign debt sparked concerns of a contagion effect on other European economies with high fiscal deficits and debt ratios. There were also fears of a spill-over to the European banking sector which has significant exposures to the sovereign debt of these countries. The financial markets initially reacted positively to the concerted and significant policy interventions announced on 8 May by the euro area governments and the ECB. However the markets were subsequently less convinced that the measures taken would be sufficient to resolve the underlying solvency problem of these countries, or that the required fiscal consolidations would be politically and socially feasible. These developments demonstrate the fragility of the global environment, and the related uncertainties pose a downside risk to the global recovery. The global inflation outlook, however, is expected to remain benign, and is not expected to pose an upside risk to domestic inflation. For much of the period since the previous MPC meeting, the exchange rate of the rand had remained relatively stable within a range of around R7,23 and R7,48 against the US dollar. The turbulence in the global financial markets resulted in a brief but significant depreciation of the rand against the US dollar, as risk aversion returned to the markets. Following the announcement of the proposed government interventions in Europe, the rand appreciated to current rates of around R7.50 against the US dollar. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand is relatively unchanged since the beginning of the year. Over the same period the rand has depreciated by over 1 per cent against the US dollar, but has appreciated by around 11 per cent against the euro. At current levels the rand remains a positive factor in the inflation outlook, but this is contingent on developments in the euro area and general risk aversion. The global developments also highlight the current focus of the financial markets on the sustainability of fiscal deficits and debt ratios. The South African national government deficit measured an estimated 6,7 per cent of GDP in the 2009/10 fiscal year, compared with the projected 7,2 per cent announced in the February budget. The deficit is expected to narrow over the next three years as the economy recovers, and to measure 4,7 per cent in the 2012/13 fiscal year. The overall government debt to GDP ratio is expected to peak at 43 per cent in the medium term. This fiscal trajectory is consistent with fiscal sustainability and the MPC does not foresee a possible conflict with monetary policy objectives should this trend be maintained. The moderate recovery in domestic economic growth appears to be sustained. Both the composite leading and coincident business cycle indicators of the Bank continued their upward trend in the first two months of 2010, confirming the positive short-term outlook for domestic economic activity. The various business confidence indices are also relatively favourable. The most recent GDP forecast of the Bank is for growth of 2,7 per cent in 2010 and 3,6 in 2011. At these rates of growth, the output gap is not seen to be an upside risk to the inflation outlook. The main risks to the growth outlook are seen to emanate from possible adverse global economic developments. The growth outlook is underpinned by the continued recovery in the manufacturing sector, which grew at a broad-based year-on-year rate of 6,3 per cent in March. The Kagiso/BER Purchasing Managers Index declined in April, but still reflects a continued expansion of this sector. Total mining production increased at a year-on-year rate of 11,0 per cent in March. Private sector demand pressures remain benign from an inflation perspective. There is some evidence of an improvement in household consumption expenditure. Real retail sales declined on a year-on-year basis in February, but the shorter-term trends were more positive. When the three months to February are compared with the previous three months, an increase of around 3 per cent was recorded. New vehicle sales also maintained their favourable trends, increasing at a year-on-year rate of 36 per cent in April. Domestic bank credit extension to the private sector continues to reflect weak demand conditions despite evidence of some loosening of credit supply constraints. Twelve-month growth in loans and advances contracted by 0,3 per cent in March 2010. Growth in mortgage advances declined from 3,9 per cent in February to 3,6 per cent in March, but nevertheless remained the only category of credit extension to register positive growth. The most recent Ernst and Young/BER Financial Services Index shows that the banks have moved to a more neutral position with respect to credit standards applied to new loans. Consumption is also determined to some extent by the wealth effects in the economy. House prices appear to have recovered somewhat, and the various indices now all reflect positive house price growth. The equity markets have also improved significantly since their lows in March 2009. However, in the five trading days to 7 May, the JSE all-share index declined by almost 10 per cent, demonstrating the vulnerability of the market to changes in sentiment. Despite the more favourable growth outlook, employment trends appear to be lagging the domestic recovery. The Quarterly Labour Force Survey indicates that 171,000 jobs were lost in the first quarter of 2010. These adverse trends are expected to constrain household consumption expenditure somewhat, and offset to some extent the positive impact on consumption of higher real wage increases. Notwithstanding these job losses, there is a concern about the possible impact of the level of wage increases in the economy. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average wage settlement rate in the first quarter of 2010 moderated to 8,4 per cent, compared with the 9,3 per cent increase measured in 2009. However the MPC noted that a number of wage negotiations are at significantly higher levels, and well above the current and expected inflation rate. Should a general upward trend in wage settlement rates transpire, in the absence of compensating increases in productivity, it could pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook. Other factors that have a significant impact on the inflation outlook include food and petrol prices. As noted earlier, food price inflation is expected to remain subdued as a result of the recent decline in the domestic maize price. The international oil price, having remained in the range of US$70-US$80 per barrel for some time, appeared to have resumed its upward trend since late April. However the recent uncertainty in the financial markets, which cast doubts about the sustainability of the global recovery, resulted in a decline in the international price of Brent crude oil to below the US$80 per barrel level. The assessment of the Monetary Policy Committee is that inflation is likely to remain within the inflation target range over the forecast period, and that the economy is expected to continue on a recovery path. The risks to the inflation forecast are seen to be more evenly balanced than at the previous meeting of the MPC. The main risks to the inflation outlook emanate from administered price developments and from the risks emanating from the global economy. The domestic growth outlook will continue to be affected by the global developments. The MPC will continue to monitor these developments closely. For these reasons, the MPC deems it appropriate to maintain the current stance of monetary policy. Accordingly the repurchase rate remains unchanged at 6,5 per cent per annum."
Peru,2010-05-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2010 BCRP RAISED THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE TO 1.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy reference rate from 1.25 percent to 1.50 percent. The nature of this measure is mainly preventive given that the clear indicators about the growth of production, in a context without inflationary pressures, allow reducing monetary stimulus. This decision does not necessarily imply the beginning of a sequence of rises in the reference interest rate, which will depend on the evaluation of inflation determinants. Several current and advanced indicators of production show a highly favorable evolution. Indicators worth pointing out include the growth of manufacturing, increased demand for electricity and for imports, greater dynamism in the construction sector, the re-initiation of important investment projects, and investors' optimistic outlook. Moreover, the global economy is also showing signs of recovery, as a result of which growth forecasts are being revised upwards. Nonetheless, there are still some risk factors associated with the fiscal soundness of some developed economies. Inflation in April recorded a rate of 0.03 percent, as a result of which annual inflation remains at 0.76 percent. Core inflation, which showed a rate of 0.23 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 1.85 percent, reflecting that no inflationary pressures are observed to date. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to raise the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 2.30 percent. Overnight deposits: 0.70 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.30 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for June on its session of June 10, 2010."
Turkiye,2010-05-18,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep overnight rates unchanged as follows, and to implement the technical rate adjustment by setting the one week repo auction rate at 7 percent: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 6.50 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 2.50 percent, lending rate at 12 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent. Recent data suggest that the recovery in economic activity is ongoing. Domestic demand is following a stable growth trend, while recent developments indicate that uncertainties regarding external demand would last for a long period. Therefore, it would take a while before industrial capacity utilization rates return to pre-crisis levels. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates remain at high levels. The Committee indicated that core inflation would continue to remain at levels below the end-year target. It was also noted that unprocessed food prices may display a significant fall in May. However, it was stated that the significant gap between inflation expectations and the medium term targets necessitates close monitoring of the pricing behavior. The Committee stated that market liquidity conditions have evolved as envisaged, and therefore, conditions are appropriate to implement the first step of the technical rate adjustment described in the “Monetary Policy Exit Strategy” published on the 14th of April 2010. Observing that current rates for one week repo auctions fluctuate around 7 percent, the Committee decided to start conducting one week repo auctions via quantity auction with fixed interest rate, in order to eliminate such fluctuations. In this respect, the one week repo rate, which becomes the new policy rate, is set at 7 percent—50 basis points above the overnight borrowing rates, as indicated in the exit strategy document. Considering the lingering uncertainties regarding global economy, the Committee reiterated that it may be necessary to maintain policy rates at current levels for some time, and to keep them at low levels for a long period. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Israel,2010-05-24,"24.05.2010 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for June 2010 unchanged at 1.5 percentThe Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for June 2010 willremain unchanged at 1.5 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The CPI for March rose by 0.9 percent, slightly more than the forecasts, which were for an increase of between 0.6 percent and 0.8 percent. The most notable rise was that of the housing component, which increased by 1 percent. Inflation in the last twelve months was 3 percent--the upper limit of the target inflation range--and excluding the effects of government actions (the changes in indirect taxes and the water surcharge), inflation was 2.6 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts:The rate of inflation expected over the next twelve months (May 2010 to April 2011), both by forecasters and as derived from the capital market, did not change from the previousmonth, and averaged 2.7 percent. Forecasters' expectations of inflation in 2010, however, increased slightly, to 1.9 percent. In the next three months the forecasters, on average, expect a cumulative increase of 1 percent in the CPI, so that inflation measured over the previous twelve months will continue to decline towards the midpoint of the target range. With regard the expected Bank of Israel interest rate a year hence, expectations calculated from the capital market are for an interest rate of 2.6 percent, and forecasters', on average, expect a rate of 3.0 percent. Real economic activity: Most indicators show that real economic activity continued to expand this month, with some indications that the rateof increase has slowed somewhat. According to the recently published National Accounts data for the first quarter of 2010. GDP grew at an annual rateof 3.3 percent, and business sector product at a rate of 4.8 percent. The GDP growth rate is slightly below the forecasts, but it is important to bear in mind that this is an initial estimate of a quarterly figure. The National Accounts figures show a decline in services exports, a continued reduction in investments, and a continued slowdown in the increase of private consumption that resulted from a drop in purchases of durables. The Bank of Israel composite state-of-the-economy index for April rose by 0.1 percent, indicating continued, but slower, expansion. Concern mounted this month that the debt crises of several European countries would have an adverse impact on the recovery in the eurozone and in the global economy. The share of Israel's total exports directed towards the countries under market pressure isrelatively small (5 percent), but if the crisis spreads to the whole of the EU, which constitutes an important market for Israel's exports (28 percent of exports), it could have a significant impact on Israel's exports. The labor market and wages: Various indicators taken together suggest continued improvement in the labor market. Data from the Ministry of Industry. Trade and Labor Employers' Survey shows that the demand for workers increased in the first quarter of 2010, for the third quarter in succession. That said, demand remains significantly lower than its level in the years 2006-08. The data on Health Tax revenues in April indicate continuing increases in wage payments. The real wage rose by 2.2 percent, annualrate, in the period December 2009 to February 2010 compared with the previous three months, the nominal wage increased by 4.2 percent, and the numberof employee posts increased by 2.3 percent. Budget data: In the first four months of 2010 the domestic deficit was NIS 3.2 billion, compared with NIS 6.6 billion in the first four months of 2009. The deficit in January-April 2010 is NIS 3 billion lower than that given by the seasonal path consistent with the budget deficit ceiling. Based on the expenditure of the budget since the beginning of the year, it is expected that the deficit in 2010 will be markedly lower than the ceiling specified in the budget--5.5 percent of GDP. The foreign exchange market: In the period from the previous monetary policy discussions of April 25 to May 23, the shekel depreciated by 2.1 percent against the dollar, and appreciated by 3.6 percent against the euro. The background to this development was the relatively rapid strengthening of the dollar against the euro, as a result of the debt crises in Europe. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel strengthened by about 1.6 percent, as a result also of its appreciation against the other currencies included in the currency basket against which the rate is calculated. The capital and money markets:Between the monetary policy discussions of April 25 and May 23, the Tel Aviv 25 index dropped by 7 percent, and the Tel Aviv 100 index by 8 percent, in line with the reductions in the major stock markets around the world. The yields on Israeli government bondsdeclined this month along both the nominal and indexed yield curves, mainly in the short part of the curves, so that the curves became steeper. The yield gap between Israeli and US unindexed 10-year government bonds widened again this month, by 44 b.p., to 158 b.p., as a result of sharp drops in yields in the US. There was continued lively interest in makam among foreign investors, who continued to expand their activity in the secondary market, in which there is active trade. Yields to terms up to 9 months increased, while those to longer terms declined, and the curve flattened. The Tel-Bond 20 index rose by about 0.3 percent over the period, while the Tel-Bond 40 index fell by about 0.6 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, increased a little this month, in line with the increases in risk premiums around the world, and reached 125 b.p, an increase of about 14 basis points from the level in the previous month. The money supply: The M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 1.9 percent in April, following its increase of 1.8 percent in March; in the last twelve months it increased by 14.9 percent. The M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits up to one year) expanded by 1.2 percent in April, following its fall of 1.1 percent in March; in the last twelve months it increased by 3.9 percent. The credit market: Total outstanding business sector credit decreased in March by 1.2 percent, to NIS 727 billion. Of this, bank credit accounted for NIS 387 billion, a drop of 0.5 percent compared with the Februarylevel. Outstanding nonbank credit declined by 2 percent. The housing market: Housing prices continued to increase: betweenMarch 2009 and February 2010 they rose by 21.9 percent, according to the house price survey, and the housing index in the CPI (based on the rental cost of apartments) increased by 5.1 percent. The rapid rate of increase of the price of housing was due both to the low rate of interest and to the supply constraint. Housing credit increased in March by 0.9 percent, to NIS 159 billion; in the last twelve months it increased by 13.5 percent. At the beginning of 2010 unindexed floating interest rate mortgages constituted 30.5 percent of all mortgages, compared with 15.6 percent at the beginning of 2008; the share of CPI-indexed floating interest rate mortgages was 25.6 percent, compared with 22.6 percent at the beginning of 2008. The global economy: During the last month the debt crises in someEuropean countries cast a cloud over the recovery trend evident in the global economy since the second half of 2009. The reversal in the markets occurred with the downgrading of the credit ratings of Greece. Portugal and Spain. As a result, there were steep falls in share markets and sharp increases in bonds yields in several European countries, in contrast to large declines in yields on German and US bonds. On May 10, the EU and the ECB, in conjunction with the IMF, produced a program that calmed the markets somewhat.As part of the program, the ECB injected liquidity into the bond markets. In contrast to these financial developments, real economic activity--led by the business sector--in the US. Europe and other leading economies, continued to increase, and companies' financialstatements for the first quarter of the year were good. Among the investment houses the consensus is that the European debt crises are expected to lead to a decline in demand, fiscal tightening in many countries, and a negative impact on the recovery. The crisis led to a significant decline in energy and commodity prices, and inflation in most advanced economies remains low. The weakness of European currencies and sterling, however, is likely toboost inflation to some extent in those countries, while also increasing their exports. The major central banks kept their interest rates basically unchanged, and even reintroduced some of their unconventional instruments. It appears that the increases in interest rates that were expected to take place in the next few months will be delayed. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for June unchanged at 1.5 percentis consistent with the gradual process of returning the interest rate to amore normal level, intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to contribute to the further recovery of economic activity, while supporting financial stability. The path of the interest rate will be determined in accordance with the inflation environment, the entrenchment of growth in Israel and globally, the rate at which the major central banks increase their interest rates, and in light of developments in the exchangerates of the shekel. At the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. Following the publication of the April CPI, inflation since the beginning of the yearwas 0 percent, and in the last twelve months was at the upper limit of thetarget inflation range. The inflation rate over the last twelve months is expected to decline to the middle of the range in the next few months. Twelve-month forward inflation expectations, both of forecasters and those calculated from the capital market, remained unchanged from the previous month,and average 2.7 percent. The reductions in commodity and oil prices aroundthe world are expected to moderate inflation in the coming months. Data regarding real economic activity in Israel that became available this month, in particular business sector product in the first quarter of the year and labor market data, continue to support the assessment that economic activity is on a rising trend, although there are signs of a slowing in the rate of increase in activity. The level of uncertainty increased this month against the background of concern that the debt crises in some European countries would cast a cloud over the recovery in the advanced economies, and would thus have a negative impact on economic activity in Israel. Interest rates of the central banks of the leading advanced economies are very low, and in light of the latest developments are expected to remain so longer thanoriginally anticipated. In addition, some of the unconventional instruments of monetary accommodation have been reintroduced. In light ofthe continued rapid increase in housing prices and the steep rise in housing credit, due partly to the low level of interest, and in order to moderate these trends and to support financial stability, the Supervisor of Banks today issued draft guidelines to banks to exercise strict checks on housingcredit, and imposing additional provisions for housing loans with high a loan-to-value ratio. Taking into account the above considerations, the Governor decided to leave the interest rate unchanged. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic and financial developments, and will use the instruments available to itto achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on June 7, 2010. The decision regarding the interest rate for July 2010 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. June 28, 2010. 24.05.2010 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for June 2010 unchanged at 1.5 percent. The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for June 2010 unchanged at 1.5 percent.

Pakistan,2010-05-24,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 24th May 2010 The economy is recovering but it lacks the necessary infrastructure and sufficient macroeconomic stability to build on the momentum. Stabilization efforts over the last one and half year have brought dividends in the shape of contraction in the external current account deficit, containment of excessive money growth, and reduction in inflation. However the worsening power crisis, which has severely hampered economic activity in the economy, and fiscal weaknesses, continue to impede sustainable recovery and comprehensive macroeconomic stability. At the same time, inflation has started to increase gradually. In this scenario, monetary policy, being stabilization tool, has to remain focused on its ultimate target of monetary and financial stability. Encouraged by an increase in exports, over $1. billion in each of the last two months, supported by steady workers' remittances, and helped by the realization of $656 million from the Coalition Support Fund (CSF) in May 2010, the external current account deficit will be close to. percent of GDP for FY10. The variables of concern, however, are uncertain official foreign flows and declining Foreign Direct Investments (FDI). Thus, despite significant contraction in the external current account deficit, $3. billion during July-April. FY10. SBP's foreign exchange reserves have largely remained unchanged, around $11. billion on average, during the course of the current fiscal year. With an expected export and import to GDP ratios of 10. and 17 percent for FY11, keeping SBP's foreign exchange reserves stable in the medium term without discernable increase in financial inflows would be challenging. Moreover since the financial inflows are, and expected to remain, heavily skewed in favour of borrowings, sustainability of external debt would require manageable current account deficit and dependable financial inflows. positive implication of the strengthened balance of payment position is gradual build-up in the Net Foreign Asset (NFA) component of broad money. After experiencing an outflow of Rs150 billion in FY09. NFA now shows an inflow of Rs90 billion during July May 14. FY10. This has facilitated market liquidity; although most of the increase in NFA took place in Q1-FY10. SBP's Open Market Operations provided the necessary support to adequately manage the market liquidity from September 2009 onwards. More importantly, this ‘correction' in the components of M2, in favour of NFA, has helped purchasing power of the rupee in the domestic economy and in the foreign exchange market. For instance, the ratio of outstanding stocks of Net Domestic Assets (NDA) to NFA has come down from high of 14 in November 2008, when inflation peaked at 25 percent, to around. by end-April 2010. The NDA continues to be driven by government's borrowings for budgetary support. In fact, for Q3- FY10, government breached its quarterly borrowing limits from SBP by about Rs30 billion. Since the beginning of Q4-FY10, government borrowing has increased by another Rs150 billion, reaching Rs1310 billion (on cash basis) on 14 May 2010 against the end-June target of Rs1130 billion. Similarly government borrowing (net of deposits) of Rs206 billion from scheduled banks during July May 14. Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN FY10 is also substantial. This persistent borrowing from the banking system for budgetary support coupled with expected borrowings for commodity operations in Q4-FY10 is jeopardizing the space for private sector credit, causing inertia in market interest rates, running the risk of excess domestic credit creation, and increasing the debt burden of future generations. The need for heavy government borrowings for budgetary support from the banking system emanates from the unsustainable equation of revenues and expenditures and uncertain external borrowings of the fiscal authority. The Federal Bureau of Revenue's (FBR) provisional tax collection figures, during the first ten months of the current fiscal year, were Rs1026 billion. This implies that, to meet the yearly target of Rs1380 billion, collection of another Rs354 billion is required in the next two months. This would be quite challenging given monthly average of Rs102 billion in the last ten months. Even if the target is met, the FBR tax-GDP ratio is likely to be less than 10 percent, which is one of the lowest in the world. There is risk that the government may miss the revised fiscal deficit target of. percent of GDP, which will be inconsistent with the objectives of macroeconomic stability. Moreover further deterioration of the fiscal account will have consequences for debt sustainability and the external balances. For medium term fiscal sustainability, necessary for overall macroeconomic stability, it is of utmost importance that effective measures are taken to increase the tax-GDP ratio and reduce the current expenditures of the government. Revenue deficit, the difference between total revenues and current expenditure, must be brought down to zero as stipulated in the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation (FRDL) Act of 2005. It was. percent of GDP in FY09 and may cross percent of the expected GDP in FY10. Cutting development expenditures may provide immediate relief but damages the prospects of much needed investment in infrastructure such as electricity generation and human capital. This in turn, limits the future productive capacity of the economy and adversely affects the inflation outlook as the gap between aggregate demand and aggregate supply widens. All inflation indicators, whether it is Consumer Price Index (CPI). Wholesale Price Index (WPI). Sensitive Price Index (SPI), or Non-food Non-energy (NFNE) and trimmed measures of core inflation, have shown an upward movement in recent months. The year-on-year CPI inflation, for instance, was recorded at 13. percent for the month of April with month-on-month growth of. percent. While adjustments in electricity prices, increase in domestic prices of petroleum products, and volatile movements in various food items have given spurt to inflation, its persistence at high level indicates that fall in productivity has played role as well. This signifies an entrenchment of expectations of double digit inflation, which must be checked to improve the prospects of sustainable economic growth. The cumulative growth of. percent in Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) during July-March. FY10 is encouraging. However its sustainability would require supportive growth in private sector credit and improvement in the availability of electricity. The former would be difficult to achieve without reduction Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN in the scale of fiscal and public sector borrowings from the banking system and the latter requires forward looking infrastructure investment and resolution of energy sector circular debt. In these circumstances, with inflation on the rise and the fiscal position not responding to the current monetary policy stance. SBP will closely monitor developments to ensure stability of aggregate prices and support nascent recovery of private economic activity. Therefore SBP has decided to maintain the policy discount rate at 12. percent. Page of."
Georgia,2010-05-25,"25.05.10 The NBG Keeps its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) unchanged at 5 Percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on May 25, 2010 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 5 percent. The annual inflation rate in April of 2010 was 5.6 percent. Inflation dynamics are in accordance with the existing forecasts. Inflation forecast have not changed significantly since the Committee's last meeting and in the medium term, inflation should stay around the six percent. Lending by banks to the economy has increased considerably over the last period, due to lending in domestic currency. Loans issued in foreign currency are still decreasing. The growth in domestic currency lending will be an important determining factor for current-year economic growth, and should reduce external risks to the economy in the future. A marked increase in imports in the March-April period is worth noting, which is a result of the pick-up in economic activity and the growth in lending. Export dynamics are optimistic; during the first four months of the year, exports grew faster than imports, although in absolute terms, the trade account deficit increased over the last two months. The growth in exports was mainly due growth in prices of large, export commodities. Compared to March, remittances decreased in April, although the annual growth rate is still high and stands above 20%. The NBG will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on June 23, 2010."
Poland,2010-05-25,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 25 May 2010 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 24-25 May 2010 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate at 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) discount rate at 4.00% on an annual basis. Further signs of recovery are appearing in the world economy. However, the outlook for improvement in economic activity has been diverging across regions. The data released since the last MPC's meeting, including the data on GDP in 2010 Q1, point at a growing investment activity and a revival in consumption demand in the United States. The rise in consumption has been supported by the improvement in the labour market situation in the United States. Preliminary estimates indicate a slight increase in the euro area GDP in 2010 Q1. Yet, as a result of the fiscal crisis in Greece and high uncertainty regarding the pace of curbing public finance imbalances in some other euro area countries, the short-term outlook for economic growth in this region has deteriorated. At the same time, fast economic growth is recorded in the largest emerging economies. The ensuing risk of strong increase in economic imbalances resulting from a boom leads to a gradual macroeconomic policy tightening in those countries. Uncertainty connected with the fiscal crisis in Greece contributed to increasing volatility of asset prices in the international financial markets, including the prices of energy commodities. Growing risk aversion in the financial markets was also conducive to a marked depreciation of the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar and to the depreciation of currencies of emerging economies, including the zloty. The data on the Polish economy indicate a continuing economic recovery. An upward trend in manufacturing has continued. Rise in employment in the corporate sector, decline in unemployment rate suggested by preliminary estimates (in seasonally adjusted terms) and the number of new job offers running at a high level might point to a gradual improvement in the labour market situation. At the same time, real wages in the corporate sector grew in annual terms, albeit still moderately, for the second consecutive month. Both the investment of enterprises as well as the capacity utilisation in the economy remain on a low level. The decline in bank loans to enterprises continues, yet, lending criteria to those entities are gradually and slightly eased. The growth in household loans stabilized at a moderate level. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. The annual CPI inflation in April 2010 decreased again (to 2.4%), running slightly below the level of the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. The inflation decline was largely driven by the lower annual growth of food prices. At the same time, core inflation also fell, yet, to a lesser extent than the CPI inflation. The factor limiting the decline in CPI inflation was the increase in the annul growth of energy prices. In line with available forecasts, in the months to come the annual CPI will still be lowered by negative base effects connected with the surge in the prices of excise goods and food prices in 2009. Also economic factors will be conducive to lower inflation: currently low demand pressure and moderate growth of labour costs. In turn, inflation decline in 2010 may be reduced by rises in commodity prices in the world markets  though recently curbed  as well as by persistently elevated growth of some administered prices, including the prices of energy carriers and services related to house maintenance. In the Council's assessment the probabilities of inflation running below or above the inflation target in the medium term are balanced. An important factor affecting monetary policy is the situation of the public finance sector. Introducing measures aimed at permanently reducing the deficit of the general government sector and at curbing the increase of the public debt will support macroeconomic stability and will allow to meet the criteria for euro adoption. The Council maintains the opinion that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organisational conditions. The Council approved the Report on the Operations of the NBP in 2009. At its meeting held on 18 May 2010, the Council adopted the Report on Monetary Policy Implementation in 2009 and positively assessed the Management Board of the National Bank of Poland as regards the implementation of monetary policy guidelines for the year 2009."
Philippines,2010-06-02,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision was based on its assessment that the prevailing inflation outlook supports keeping monetary settings unchanged. The latest BSP projections show headline inflation averaging within the target ranges for 2010 and 2011. These projections are slightly lower compared to those of the previous policy meeting as a result of lower energy prices and slower domestic liquidity growth. Liquidity growth decelerated in recent months as a result of the BSP's withdrawal of liquidity-enhancing measures implemented at the height of the global financial crisis. The Board concluded that the upside risks surrounding the inflation projections associated mainly with supply-side factors relating to food and energy appeared to have lessened. On the other hand, the strong pickup in exports, consumer spending, and investments shown in the first quarter GDP data, if sustained, could point to potential demand-side pressures. Nevertheless, such pressures could be tempered by weaker external demand from major trading partners, including the potential impact of fiscal concerns in the euro area. In the face of uncertain global economic prospects and with recovery at different stages and speeds in various parts of the world, together with the flexibility provided by the inflation outlook, the Board views as prudent the move to keep policy settings unchanged. At the same time, it will continue to monitor closely the growth in liquidity as Asia's relatively strong cyclical position could attract significant private capital inflows. The Board is prepared to recalibrate monetary policy settings when necessary to safeguard price stability."
Thailand,2010-06-02,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 2 June 2010 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Assistant Governor. Bank of Thailand, announces the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, as follows. Global economic outlook has improved since the last MPC meeting, supported by continued growth in the US. Japan and particularly in Asia. However sovereign debt problems in some European economies may dampen the region's recovery and pose risks to the sustainability of global growth. The MPC will closely monitor the outcome of measures taken to resolve problems and restore confidence in Europe. The Thai economy expanded in the first quarter of 2010 at a stronger pace than anticipated. This was driven by strong growth in exports and tourism, on the back of global economic recovery. Also domestic demand, especially private investment, continued to expand. In April, economic activities slowed down somewhat, partly owing to adverse impacts of domestic political situation on tourism as well as confidence of consumers and businesses. Meanwhile inflation remains low at present but is projected to increase in the periods ahead. The MPC judges that Thailand's economic fundamentals are robust, and should enable the economy to continue growing in the second half of this year. However uncertainties related to the impact of sovereign debt problems in Europe and domestic political situation remain key risks to the growth outlook. The MPC therefore decided to maintain the policy interest rate at 125 per cent for the time being."
Euroarea,2010-06-10,"Ladies and gentlemen. Mr Constâncio, the new Vice-President of the ECB, and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Taking into account all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 6 May 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Global inflationary pressures may persist, while domestic price pressures are expected to remain low. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the first half of 2010, but quarterly growth rates are likely to be rather uneven. Looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace, in an environment of continued tensions in some financial market segments and of unusually high uncertainty. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Monetary policy will do all that is needed to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. This is the necessary and central contribution that monetary policy makes to fostering sustainable economic growth, job creation and financial stability. All the non-standard measures taken during the period of strong financial market tensions, referred to as “enhanced credit support” and the Securities Markets Programme, are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. We remain firmly committed to price stability over the medium to longer term, and the monetary policy stance and the overall provision of liquidity will be adjusted as appropriate. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. After a period of sharp decline, euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009. According to Eurostat's first estimate, euro area real GDP increased, on a quarterly basis, by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2010. While adverse weather conditions, in particular, dampened growth in the early part of the year, the latest economic indicators suggest that a rebound took place during the spring. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects real GDP to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace over time and across economies and sectors of the euro area. The ongoing recovery at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports, together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system, should provide support to the euro area economy. However, the recovery of activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and weak labour market prospects. This assessment is also reflected in the June 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, according to which annual real GDP growth will range between 0.7% and 1.3% in 2010 and between 0.2% and 2.2% in 2011. Compared with the March 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the range for real GDP growth this year has been revised slightly upwards, owing to the positive impact of stronger activity worldwide in the short run, while the range has been revised somewhat downwards for 2011, reflecting mainly domestic demand prospects. The June 2010 Eurosystem staff projections are broadly in line with forecasts by international organisations. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to the economic outlook are broadly balanced, in an environment of unusually high uncertainty. On the upside, the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected, thereby further supporting euro area exports. On the downside, concerns remain relating to renewed tensions in some financial market segments and related confidence effects. In addition, a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances, may weigh on the downside. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.6% in May 2010, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 1.5% in April. The rise in inflation over recent months mostly reflects higher energy prices. During the second half of this year some further slight increases in HICP inflation cannot be excluded. Looking further ahead, inflation rates should overall remain moderate. Upward pressures on commodity prices may persist, while euro area domestic price pressures are expected to remain low. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This assessment is also reflected in the June 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 1.4% and 1.6% for 2010 and between 1.0% and 2.2% for 2011. Compared with the ECB staff projections of March 2010, the ranges have been adjusted somewhat upwards, mainly reflecting higher euro prices for commodities. Available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture. Risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced. Upside risks over the medium term relate, in particular, to the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. Overall, the Governing Council will monitor closely the future evolution of all available price indicators. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 was unchanged at -0.1% in April 2010. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased somewhat further and turned positive, but remained weak at 0.1%. Together, these data continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. Shorter-term developments in M3 and loans have remained volatile and, given the renewed tensions in some financial market segments, volatility in M3 and its components may well continue. The actual growth in M3 continues to understate the underlying pace of monetary expansion, but the downward impact of the rather steep yield curve and the associated allocation of funds to longer-term deposits and securities outside M3 appear to be gradually waning. The same holds for the shifts within M3 that have been observed as a response to the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different M3 instruments. The still weak annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector conceals the fact that monthly flows have now been positive for a number of months. At the same time, these aggregate developments continue to reflect mainly an ongoing strengthening in the annual growth of loans to households, while the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained negative. A lagged response of loans to non-financial corporations to economic activity is a normal feature of the business cycle. The latest data confirm that the reduction in the size of banks' overall balance sheets has not continued since the turn of the year. However, further adjustments cannot be ruled out and the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up. To address this challenge, banks should turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 6 May 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Global inflationary pressures may persist, while domestic price pressures are expected to remain low. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the first half of 2010, but quarterly growth rates are likely to be rather uneven. Looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace, in an environment of continued tensions in some financial market segments and of unusually high uncertainty. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. As regards fiscal policies, the Governing Council welcomes the recent decision by euro area countries to formally establish a European Financial Stability Facility. This needs to be accompanied by decisive action at the level of governments. It is essential that all countries stick to their commitments to correct high budget deficits and government debt and reduce fiscal vulnerability. To this end, the concrete adjustment measures needed to achieve the budgetary targets should be fully specified. All countries must ensure that confidence in the sustainability of public finances is guaranteed. The Governing Council welcomes the fact that a number of euro area governments with the highest deficits and strongly increasing debt levels have adopted additional fiscal consolidation measures and set out more ambitious fiscal targets. In this context, we took note of the spring 2010 orientations for fiscal policies in euro area countries agreed by the euro area finance ministers on 7 June, and welcome the commitment to take additional measures, where needed, in order to ensure the achievement of the budgetary targets for 2010 and beyond. The Governing Council fully agrees with the ministers on the priority of halting and reversing the increase in the debt ratio and welcomes the commitment to take immediate action to that effect. For all euro area countries, structural reforms leading to higher growth and employment are crucial to support a sustainable recovery. Existing competitiveness problems, as well as domestic and external imbalances, need to be urgently addressed by the countries concerned. To that end, wage-bargaining should allow wages to adjust appropriately to the competitiveness and unemployment situation. Likewise, measures that increase price flexibility and non-price competitiveness are essential. Finally, an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should play an important role. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks' resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth, job creation and financial stability."
South Korea,2010-06-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. In the global economy, emerging market economies have sustained their favorable performance, while the economies of major advanced countries such as the US and Japan have continued improvement. There is, however, an underlying risk that the international financial markets may be destabilized at any time due to the government debt problems in some European countries, and that this could exercise an influence on the recovering trend in the global economy. The upward trend of domestic economic activity appears to have been maintained. Even though the increasing trend of domestic demand such as consumption and investment has temporarily faltered, exports have sustained their buoyancy and, led by the private sector, labor market conditions have improved further. This upward trend is expected to be maintained. Considering the overseas risk factors, however, there still remains uncertainty as to the economic growth path. Consumer price inflation has accelerated slightly, driven mainly by petroleum products, and demand-pull pressure is expected to increase gradually as the upward trend of economic activity continues. In the real estate market, housing sales prices have shown weakness, dragged down by prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas. In the financial markets, price variables such as stock prices and exchange rates have been highly volatile due to the government debt problems in some European countries and the increase in the geo-political risks surrounding the Korean Peninsula. The scale of the growth in mortgage lending has widened slightly in response chiefly to reduced lending rates, even though house transactions have been inactive. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain the accommodative policy stance in such a way as to help the economy sustain its sound growth on a foundation of price stability and, in carrying out policy, it will take overall account of financial and economic conditions at home and abroad."
Chile,2010-06-15,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 15 June 2010 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points to 1.0% (annual). Internationally, volatility in financial markets associated with the economic situation in Europe remains high. In the most likely scenario, a limited effect from those turbulences is expected on the world economic outlook. Overall, uncertainty persists. The prices of copper and oil have declined but are still high. Domestically, available output data show that the immediate effects of the earthquake and tsunami of 27 February dissipated quickly and the economy returned to a recovery path. Demand indicators show significant dynamism and unemployment has kept on falling. In May, the CPI posted an increase in line with market expectations. Core inflation is still showing small variations. Private expectations at longer terms are consistent with y-o-y inflation rates around 3% in the policy horizon. The Board has deemed appropriate to start the withdrawal of the significant monetary stimulus in place, which will continue at a pace that depends on the unfolding of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions. Accordingly, the Board reiterates that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2010-06-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2010 BCRP RAISED THE REFERENCE RATE TO 1.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy reference rate from 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent This measure is mainly preventive given the strong dynamism of domestic demand and implies maintaining monetary stimulus in a context in which no inflationary pressures are observed. This decision does not necessarily imply a sequence of rises in the reference interest rate, which will depend on the evaluation of inflation determinants Current and advanced indicators of production show a highly favorable evolution of the economy in the second quarter. Indicators worth pointing out include the growth of manufacturing, increased demand for electricity and for imports, and greater dynamism in the construction sector. The global economy is also showing signs of recovery, even though uncertainty associated with the fiscal weakening of some European countries persists in international financial markets. The rate of inflation in May was 0.24 percent, as a result of which annual inflation increased to 1.04 percent. Core inflation, which showed a rate of 0.14 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 1.8 percent and remains around the 2 percent target. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to raise the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 2.55 percent. Overnight deposits: 0.95 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.55 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for July on its session of July 8, 2010."
Georgia,2010-06-16,"16.06.10 The NBG Raises its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) to 6.25 Percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on June 16, 2010 and decided to raise its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) to 6.25 percent. The annual inflation rate in May stood at 4 percent. Inflation forecast indicators have increased since the Committee's last meeting. According to the existing forecasts, if the monetary policy stance remains unchanged in the medium term, the increase in consumer prices may exceed six percent. The annual growth rate of the broad money M3 aggregate surpassed 40 percent in June. The growth of the money supply is on the one hand a result of economic fiscal stimulus while on the other hand, it is a product of the growth in lending to the economy since the start of the year. The growth rate in the money supply is not in accordance with the growth rate of the economy and creates inflation risks in the medium term. According to the preliminary data, just like April and March, the trade deficit in commodity products deepened in May which was a result of increasing domestic demand. The deepening trade deficit, coupled with lower than expected capital inflows during the first half of the year and the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar on the world markets resulted in the devaluation of the Lari. Taking into consideration the abovementioned factors, in order to keep inflation within the bounds of the inflation target, a need to tighten monetary policy has arisen. The NBG will closely monitor developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on July 7, 2010."
Egypt,2010-06-17,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release June 17, 2010 In its meeting held on June 17, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 825 percent and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 85 percen. Annual headline CPI declined to 1059 percent in May from 1138 percent registered in April 2010, yet remains elevated reflecting the impact of last year's unfavorable shock related to fruits and vegetable. In the meantime, annual core CPI increased slightly from 662 percent in April to 669 percent in May and remains within the CBE's comfort zon. Meanwhile annual real GDP growth recorded 58 percent in 2009/10 Q3 compared to the four year low of 41 percent witnessed in 2008/09 Q2, reflecting a steady improvement in economic activit. Looking ahead, unfolding global economic developments in Europe have created uncertainty about the nascent global recovery, which could potentially weigh on external demand and investment in Egyp. Against this background, the MPC assesses that inflationary pressures remain subdued and that the current level of policy interest rate is appropriate and supportive of the economic recovery while consistent with maintaining core inflation within the CBE's comfort zone in the medium-ter. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Turkiye,2010-06-17,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep one-week repo auction rate (the policy rate) and overnight rates unchanged as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 7 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 6.50 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 2.50 percent, lending rate at 12 percent, d) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent. Recent data suggest that the recovery in economic activity is ongoing. Domestic demand growth is relatively stable, while uncertainties regarding external demand have become more significant. Therefore, it would take a while before industrial capacity utilization rates return to pre-crisis levels. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates remain at high levels. The Committee has indicated that core inflation would continue to remain at levels below the year-end target and to follow a path consistent with the medium term targets. Moreover, it has also been noted that the fall in unprocessed food prices and easing commodity prices have led to a more favorable inflation outlook than envisaged in the April Inflation Report, which is also having a positive impact on inflation expectations. In light of these developments, the Committee reiterated that it may be necessary to maintain policy rates at current levels for some time, and to keep them at low levels for a long period. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."

United States,2010-06-23,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that the economic recovery is proceeding and that the labor market is improving gradually. Household spending is increasing but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly; however, investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Housing starts remain at a depressed level. Financial conditions have become less supportive of economic growth on balance, largely reflecting developments abroad. Bank lending has continued to contract in recent months. Nonetheless, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for a time. Prices of energy and other commodities have declined somewhat in recent months, and underlying inflation has trended lower. With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A Duke; Donald L Kohn; Sandra Pianalto; Eric S Rosengren; Daniel K Tarullo; and Kevin M Warsh. Voting against the policy action was Thomas M Hoenig, who believed that continuing to express the expectation of exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period was no longer warranted because it could lead to a build-up of future imbalances and increase risks to longer-run macroeconomic and financial stability, while limiting the Committee's flexibility to begin raising rates modestly."
Israel,2010-06-28,"28.06.2010 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for July 2010 unchanged at 1.5 percentThe Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for June 2010 willremain unchanged at 1.5 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The CPI for May rose by 0.4 percent, within the range predicted by forecasters, which was between 0.2 percent and 0.5 percent. The housing index continued to rise relatively rapidly, by 0.7 percent, and by 1.6 percent since the beginning of the year. Inflation in the last twelve months was 3 percent--the upper limit of the target inflation range--and adjusting for the effects of changes inindirect taxes and surcharges, it was 2.7 percent. Since the beginning of the year prices have risen by 0.4 percent--below the middleof the seasonal path consistent with an annual inflation rate of 2 percentfor 2010. Inflation and interest rate forecasts:On average, forecasters expect the rate of inflation over the next twelve months (June 2010 to May 2011) to be 2.6 percent. Inflation expectations derived from the capital market rose after the publication of the May CPI, and in the last week they varied around the upper limit of the inflation target. In the next three monthsthe forecasters, on average, expect a cumulative increase of 1 percent in the CPI (seasonally adjusted, this increase is consistent with the lower half of the target inflation range), and of 1.9 percent in 2010 as a whole. According to these assessments, the inflation rate, measured over the past twelve months, will continue to decline towards the midpoint of the target range. With regard to the Bank of Israel interest rate expected for a year hence, expectations calculated from the capital market are for an interest rate of 2.4 percent, while forecasters, on average, expect a rate of 3.0 percent. According to predictions based on assessments by the Bank of Israel'seconomists and model, inflation in the last twelve months is on a declining trend, and is expected to approach the lower limit of the inflation target at the end of the year, and its mid-point in another twelve months. Concurrently, according to the model, the Bank of Israel's key interest rate is expected to reach an average of 2.1 percent in 2010:IV. Real economic activity: Indicators of economic activity that havebecome available during the past month, present a mixed picture, with somedata suggesting a slowdown of growth. Assessments of continued expansion are supported by preliminary data from the Companies Survey for 2010:II and the GDP growth rate, which increased from 3.3 to 3.6 percent in the reviseddata for 2010:I. Additional support for this view was provided by the new reading of the growth in exports, in annual terms, in 2010 which was revised from 7.3 to 7.4 percent, as well as by the 4.8 percent rise in business-sector product in 2010:I. Assessments regarding the moderation of the rate of expansion are supported by monthly indicators of private consumption, which point to its continued increase, with some moderation in 2010:II (April-May data), by the Bank of Israel's composite state-of-the-economy index forApril and May, which rose by 0.1 percent, and by gross VAT receipts on domestic production, whose rate of increase continued to moderate. In addition, data on export orders in the services and manufacturing sectors for 2010:III, from the Companies Survey, point to stagnation in exports. According to the Google Search Index, calculated by the Bank of Israel's Research Department, the probability of a moderation in demand continued to rise, and reached 80 percent. The sharp decline in the Purchasing Managers Index, as well as in the Globes newspaper's index of consumer confidence, also attest to the same trend. The labor market and wages: Various indicators taken together suggest that there was a slowdown in the rate of recovery of the labor market in 2010:I. Data from the labor force survey for 2010:I indicate a further contraction in unemployment, for the third consecutive quarter, to 7.2 percent. However, the rate of decline was slower than in the previous two quarters, and was based on a fall in the participation rate rather than on a risein employment. Real and nominal wages were up by 5.2 percent and 6.8 percent respectively, at annual rates, in the period January to March relative to the previous three months. In the same period the number of employee posts increased by 3.1 percent in annual terms. Budget data: From the beginning of 2010 until May the domestic deficit was NIS 3.3 billion, compared with NIS 8.2 billion in the equivalent period in 2009. The deficit in this period was NIS 1.7 billion lower than that given by the seasonal path consistent with the budget, a deviation which stemmed primarily from revenues that were NIS 1.4 billion higher than in the budget forecast. Consequently, the deficit in 2010 is expected to be about 4 percent of GDP. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion, held on May 23, and until June 27, the shekel depreciated by 1.1 percent against the dollar, and appreciated by 0.4 percent against the euro, at a time when most currencies worldwide rallied markedly against both the dollar and the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, theshekel weakened by about 1.2 percent, as a result also of its depreciationagainst the other currencies included in the currency basket against whichthe rate is calculated. The capital and money markets:Between the monetary policy discussions of May 23 and June 27, the Tel Aviv 25 index dropped by 1.4 percent, and the Tel Aviv 100 index by 0.8 percent, despite the rise in the major stock markets around the world during that period. Yields on Israel governmentbonds declined this month along both the nominal and indexed yield curves,mainly in the short term. The yield gap between Israel and US unindexed 10-year government bonds narrowed this month, to stand at 147 b.p., as a result of sharper declines in yields in Israel. There was continued lively interest in Makam among foreigninvestors, but in May the extent of their accrual of Makam was significantly lower than in April. The Tel-Bond 20 index rose by about 2.2 percent over the period, and the Tel-Bond 40 index went up by about 1.8 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, dippeda little this month, in line with the trend in risk premiums around the world, and reached 115 b.p. The money supply: The M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) fell by 0.2 percent in May, following its 2.2 percent increase in April; in the last twelve months it increased by 12.2 percent. The M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) declined by 0.2 percent in May, following its 1.3 percent rise in April; in the last twelve months it increased by 4.2 percent. The credit market: Total outstanding business sector credit rose in April by 0.7 percent, to NIS 740 billion, after declining by 0.5 percentin March. Of this, bank credit accounted for NIS 392 billion, up by 1.1 percent over March. Outstanding nonbank credit expanded by 0.2 percent in April, compared with a 2 percent decline in March. The housing market: There was some moderation in the rise in housing prices in March 2009, according to the house price survey, and they were up by 21 percent over the past twelve months. Since the beginning of the year there has been a steady decline in the supply of new apartments for purchase, continuing the long-term trend. However, the number of building starts in the last twelve months is up by 6 percent over the preceding twelve-month period. The global economy: The global recovery is continuing. In 2010:I growth accelerated against the backdrop of positive developments in inventories, the persistent positive effect of fiscal stimulus packages, and the ongoing monetary expansion. Some recovery was also evident in private demand. Nevertheless, the level of uncertainty regarding the persistence and extent of economic growth has increased, and it is generally expected that the growth rate will slow in the second half of 2010, mainly against the backdrop of the dissipation of the positive effects of government activity and the expected economic slowdown in Europe. In most countries the fiscal expansion is nearing its conclusion, and programs involving fiscal contraction have been introduced in Europe. Investors' apprehensions in view of the largedebts and deficits of many countries, as well as of the stability of the banking system in Europe, have generated considerable uncertainty in the markets. Inflation and expected inflation remained moderate, primarily in the context of the continued weakness of the labor market and the high output gap. Thus, in view of the slowdown in Europe and indications of a loss of momentum in the US, combined with the low inflation rate, many central banks in the advanced economies are refraining from raising interest rates at present. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for June unchanged at 1.5 percent is consistent with the gradual process of returning the interest rate to a more 'normal' level, intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to contribute to the further recovery of economic activity, while supporting financial stability. The path of the interest rate will bedetermined in accordance with the inflation environment, the entrenchment of growth in Israel and globally, the rate at which the major central banksincrease their interest rates, and in light of developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. At the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. The trend of the inflation rate, measured over the past twelve months, has been downwards for several months. Since the beginning of the year inflation has been below the seasonal trend consistent with the middle of the target range for 2010. According to Bank of Israel assessments and forecasters' predictions, the retrospective twelve-month inflation rate will continue to decline tothe middle of the range, or even below it, in the next few months. According to twelve-month forward inflation expectations, both of forecasters and those calculated from the capital market, in another year the inflation rate will return to the upper part of the inflation target range, with a cumulative interest-rate increase of between 1 and 1.5 percent in the next twelve months. After a period of a year of relatively rapid growth, some data have turned negative, leading to greater uncertainty about the persistence of this trend. Preliminary data from the Companies Survey for 2010:II show that economic activity continues to expand, albeit at a somewhat slower pace, with indications of weakness in exports for the next quarter, in both the manufacturing and theservices sectors. The main negative indicators are: those for domestic activityC 2AD, export data and the Purchasing Managers Index; and for the global economy, developments in Europe and the US. The interest rates of the central banks of the leading advanced economies are very low, and in view of the increased concern over possible negative developments in the global economy and the continued moderation of inflation expectations, these interest rates are expected to remain low for significantly longerthan originally anticipated. In addition, in light of recent developments,some of the unconventional instruments of monetary accommodation have beenreintroduced. Taking into account the increased uncertainties in the global economy, and in Europe in particular, and the effect these have on Israel's economy, the Governor has decided to leave the interest rate unchanged this month. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic and financial developments, and will use the instruments available to itto achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on July 7, 2010. The decision regarding the interest rate for August 2010 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. July 26, 2010. 28.06.2010 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for July 2010 unchanged at 1.5 percent. The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for July 2010 unchanged at 1.5 percent. The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for June 2010 willremain unchanged at 1.5 percent. Background conditions. Inflation data: The CPI for May rose by 0.4 percent, within the range predicted by forecasters, which was between 0.2 percent and 0.5 percent. Concurrently, according to the model, the Bank of Israel's key interest rate is expected to reach an average of 2.1 percent in 2010:IV. Real economic activity: Indicators of economic activity that havebecome available during the past month, present a mixed picture, with somedata suggesting a slowdown of growth. Consequently, the deficit in 2010 is expected to be about 4 percent of GDP. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion, held on May 23, and until June 27, the shekel depreciated by 1.1 percent against the dollar, and appreciated by 0.4 percent against the euro, at a time when most currencies worldwide rallied markedly against both the dollar and the euro. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for June unchanged at 1.5 percent is consistent with the gradual process of returning the interest rate to a more 'normal' level, intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to contribute to the further recovery of economic activity, while supporting financial stability. The main negative indicators are: those for domestic activityC 2AD, export data and the Purchasing Managers Index; and for the global economy, developments in Europe and the US. The interest rates of the central banks of the leading advanced economies are very low, and in view of the increased concern over possible negative developments in the global economy and the continued moderation of inflation expectations, these interest rates are expected to remain low for significantly longerthan originally anticipated."
Poland,2010-06-30,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 30 June 2010 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 29-30 June 2010 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) discount rate 4.00% on an annual basis. Further signals of recovery can be seen in the world economy. However, the rate of economic growth varies across regions. The recovery in the United States has continued, even though some economic activity indicators (including the latest data on GDP growth in 2010 Q1, the real estate market and retail sales) have deteriorated in this country in the recent period. At the beginning of 2010 Q2 the level of economic activity in the euro area proved higher than in Q1. However, the slight worsening in the business climate indicators in subsequent months may be signalling the slower pace of activity improvement in this region. The short-term growth outlook for the euro area is negatively affected by the uncertainty regarding the pace of reducing public finance imbalance in the region, including the uncertainty connected with the fiscal crisis in Greece. At the same time, fast economic growth is continuing in the largest emerging economies. The ensuing risk of a significant deepening of economic imbalance as a result of the economic boom leads to a gradual tightening of macroeconomic policy in these countries. Disruptions in the international financial markets, connected with the uncertainty as to the reduction of fiscal imbalances in some of euro-area countries, continued. The scale of those disruptions has nevertheless decreased recently, which has contributed to halting the fall in prices of some financial assets. The data on the Polish economy indicate a stabilisation of the rate of economic growth. Robust increase in industrial output continued. Following a strong decline at the beginning of the year, construction output is also gradually increasing. In May retail sales rose as well. Employment growth in the enterprise sector (for the first time since January 2009 also in year-on-year terms) and stabilisation of the unemployment rate (in seasonally adjusted terms) observed in May 2010 are signs of a gradual improving labour market situation. At the same time, in May 2010 real wages in the enterprise sector increased (in year-on-year terms) for the third consecutive month. The growth of loans to households stabilised at a moderate level. The investment activity of enterprises is still limited and will probably remain so in the quarters to come, especially because the production capacity utilisation in enterprises  though rising  remains low. No revival in lending to the ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, corporate sector can be seen, which is characteristic amid a low investment activity and good financial situation of enterprises, including their good liquidity standing. In May 2010 the annual CPI inflation fell back again (to 2.2%), running below to the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. This decline in CPI inflation was mainly connected with a decrease in core inflation. In the coming period, inflation will be further lowered by negative base effects stemming from a strong increase in the prices of excise goods in 2009. The Council has got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute of the NBP, which is one of the inputs into the Council's decision-making on the NBP interest rates. In line with the June projection  under the assumption of constant NBP interest rates  there is a 50-percent probability of inflation running in the range of 2.3-2.9% in 2010 (compared to 1.3-2.2% in the February projection), 2.1-3.3% in 2011 (compared to 1.7-3.1%) and 2.2-3.7% in 2012 (compared to 2.6-4.6%). In turn, the June projection sees the annual GDP growth with a 50- percent probability in the range of 2.5-3.9% in 2010 (compared to 2.1-4.1% in the February projection), 3.3-5.9% in 2011 (compared to 1.8-4.0%) and 2.2-5.0% in 2012 (compared to 1.9- 4.3%). The Council has discussed factors that may fuel inflationary pressures in the medium term. An important factor affecting monetary policy is the situation of public finance, especially in the face of changing attitude in many European countries to high budget deficits and growing public debts. Introducing decisive measures aimed at permanently reducing the deficit of the general government sector and at curbing the increase of the public debt is necessary for macroeconomic stability and will allow the meeting of euro adoption criteria. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the ERM II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organisational conditions. The Council has adopted the Inflation Report  June 2010."
Romania,2010-06-30,"In its meeting of June 30, 2010, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR is vigilantly monitoring domestic and global economic developments so that, via an adequate use of its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. The annual inflation rate was 4.42 percent in May versus 4.28 percent in April in the context of a depreciating leu, amid worsening risk perception regarding the economies in the region and given that some domestic risks related to fiscal and income policies have materialized. Although headline inflation has dropped relatively slowly, the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation1 hovered around 2 percent over the past five months, being below the 2.8 percent level in December 2009. The analysis of macroeconomic developments shows a persistent economic decline in the first quarter of this year after the severe contraction in the year before, while the current account deficit is seen remaining at sustainable levels. As the increased value added tax will immediately trigger a significant rise of consumer price levels  and consequently a temporary pick-up in inflation  the NBR will act to limit the second-round effects of this measure and firmly anchor inflation expectations at low levels. The risk related to the above-mentioned effects, together with persistent uncertainties surrounding the results of fiscal consolidation efforts as well as of those regarding the developments in the world economy, requires a continued prudent monetary policy stance. In this context, the NBR Board has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 6.25 percent per annum and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. It also decided to ensure firm management of liquidity in the banking system. These decisions are aimed at ensuring further disinflation in line with the medium-term objectives, a sustainable revival of lending in the Romanian economy, especially of loans to the private sector, as well as avoiding excessive exchange rate volatility. These will create favourable conditions for a sustainable economic recovery. The NBR Board reaffirms that further compliance with the commitments set under the multilateral external financing arrangement with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions is essential in order to ensure a sustainable resumption of disinflation, to maintain financial stability and to achieve lasting economic recovery. According to the calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for August 4, 2010, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1) Calculated by the NBR by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index."
India,2010-07-02,"RBI announces Monetary Policy and Liquidity Management Measures Monetary Policy Measures On an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to take the following monetary policy measures as a part of the calibrated exit from the expansionary monetary policy: to increase the repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 5.25 per cent to 5.50 per cent with immediate effect. to increase the reverse repo rate under the LAF by 25 basis points from 3.75 per cent to 4.0 per cent with immediate effect. Liquidity Management Measures Also, on the basis of an assessment of the current liquidity situation, the Reserve Bank has decided to extend the following liquidity management measures: The additional liquidity support to scheduled commercial banks under the LAF to the extent of up to 0.5 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) currently set to expire on July 2, 2010 is now extended up to July 16, 2010. For any shortfall in maintenance of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) arising out of availment of this facility, banks may seek waiver of penal interest purely as an ad hoc measure. ii) The second LAF (SLAF) will be conducted on a daily basis up to July 16, 2010. Rationale for Monetary Policy Measures There have been significant macroeconomic developments since the April 2010 Monetary Policy Statement. At the global level, the recovery is strengthening. However, the outlook continues to be clouded by uncertainty in the Euro area. On the domestic front, the revised growth estimates by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) for 2009-10 and for Q4 of 2009-10 suggest that the recovery is consolidating. The manufacturing sector has recorded robust growth in recent months, aided among others, by expanding exports. The strong underlying growth momentum is also evidenced by the sharp upturn in the capital goods sector, acceleration in credit growth and the widening current account deficit. The monsoon situation so far has been decidedly better than during last year holding prospects for good agriculture growth. In its April policy review, the Reserve Bank projected real GDP growth for 2010- 11 at 8 per cent with an upside bias. More recent data suggest that the upside bias has largely materialised. The growth projection will be reviewed in the First Quarter Review on July 27, 2010. The developments on the inflation front, however, raise several concerns. Overall WPI inflation increased to 10.2 in May 2010, up from 9.6 per cent in April 2010. Food price inflation and consumer price inflation remain at elevated levels. There has2 been some moderation in food price inflation, but the price index of food articles continues to increase. More importantly, the prices of non-food manufactured goods and fuel items have accelerated in recent months. Year-on-year WPI non-food manufacturing products (weight: 52.2 per cent) inflation, which was (-) 0.4 per cent in November 2009 and 5.4 per cent in March 2010, rose further to 6.6 per cent in May 2010. Year-on-year fuel price inflation also surged from (-) 0.8 per cent in November 2009 to 12.7 per cent in March 2010 and further to 13.1 per cent in May 2010. Although entirely justified in terms of long-term fiscal and energy conservation objectives, the recent increase in fuel prices will have an immediate impact of around one percentage point on WPI inflation, with second round effects being felt in the months ahead. Significantly, two-thirds of WPI inflation in May 2010 was contributed by non-food items, suggesting that inflation is now very much generalised and that demand-side pressures are evident. Timing of the Action This mid-cycle policy action has been warranted by the evolving macroeconomic situation. Even as data for real GDP growth and WPI inflation became available by mid-June 2010, it was considered inadvisable to raise the policy rates as the financial system was dealing with liquidity pressures triggered by sudden build-up in government cash balances occasioned by the larger than anticipated level of 3G spectrum and broadband wireless access auction realisations. Through the month of June, liquidity under LAF operations remained in deficit mode. Consequently, the call rate moved up significantly, resulting in an effective tightening at the short end of the yield curve. The liquidity situation has since begun to ease. Rationale for Extension of Liquidity Management Measures In late May 2010, in anticipation of the liquidity pressures on account of payments for 3G spectrum and advance taxes, the Reserve Bank took certain liquidity easing measures. Even as the liquidity situation has begun to ease, these measures are being extended since liquidity tightness may persist. Expected Outcomes The above monetary measures should contain inflation and anchor inflationary expectations going forward, while not hurting the recovery process. Easing liquidity and raising rates at the same time may seem apparently inconsistent. It should be noted in this context that the liquidity easing measures have become necessary to manage what is essentially a temporary and unanticipated development. In no way should they be viewed as inconsistent with the monetary policy stance of calibrated exit, which remains focussed on containing inflation and anchoring inflationary expectations without hurting growth. The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor the macroeconomic conditions, particularly the price situation, and take further action as warranted.

Nigeria,2010-07-05,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 71 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. July 5, 2010 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 5th July, 2010 to review domestic economic conditions during the first half of 2010 and the challenges facing the Nigerian economy against the backdrop of developments in the international economic and financial environments in order to reassess the options for monetary policy for the remainder of the year. On the global scene, the Committee noted that market anxiety over the fiscal positions of several Euro Area countries was posing new challenges for the world economy even as global economic recovery remained fragile. In order to address the weak fiscal position, governments in these countries have started unwinding the fiscal stimuli by cutting government spending. Such cuts in public spending may have serious implications for growth and employment and may lead to a double dip recession with possible contagion effects on the global economy. If this were to happen, there may be an impact on global commodity prices, including prices of oil, with knock-on effects on the government's fiscal position and the foreign sector. However recovery remained robust in most developing and developed countries, with the exception of high-income European countries where it stagnated. In this regard, the Committee commended the recent commitment of the G-20 Summit in Toronto. Canada, which agreed to safeguard and strengthen the recovery process to lay the foundation for strong, sustainable and balanced growth, as well as strengthen the financial systems against risks. The G-20 leaders of the world's major industrialized and emerging market economies welcomed measures so far taken to sustain global recovery and strengthen the financial systems, while agreeing to work together to curb public deficits, enhance economic growth and job creation as well as global prosperity. The Committee believes that the decision of the G-20 Summit would refocus and galvanize global strategies towards the recovery process. On the domestic scene, the MPC observed that financial markets, though still fragile, have recovered faster than expected, urging greater efforts in accelerating reforms in the other sectors of the economy. This is critical for economic growth. The MPC also noted the sustained rebound in commodity prices which is helping to support growth in commodity producing regions, including Nigeria. However it underscored the need to diversify the economy to protect the country from the vagaries of oil price volatility. The Committee believes that the inflation risk of the rebound in energy prices appears mitigated by the continuing low levels of capacity utilization, weak private demand, good harvest, and well-anchored inflation expectations. In addition, as mentioned above, the European fiscal crisis and the recent slowdown in manufacturing output in China and other Asian countries may moderate the robustness of the markets. Key Domestic Macroeconomic and Financial Developments Output and Prices: The Committee observed that the impressive output growth recorded in 2009 continued in 2010. Provisional data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicates that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 723 per cent in the first quarter of 2010 up from 450 per cent recorded in the first quarter of 2009. GDP was projected to grow by 768, 776 and 813 per cent in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2010, respectively. Overall GDP growth for 2010 is projected at 774 per cent which is higher than the revised figure of 666 per cent recorded in 2009. The non-oil sector is expected to remain the main driver of overall growth, with agriculture, wholesale and retail trade, and services contributing 249, 203 and 211 per cent, respectively. The Committee believes that the impressive growth forecasts reflected prospects for moderate rainfall in 2010, which is expected to support the production of major crops across the country, coupled with the current peace in the Niger-Delta, which has led to an increase in crude oil and natural gas production. It however, cautioned that there is a thick cloud hanging over commodity producing countries because of the current crisis facing the Euro Area and emerging slowdown in manufacturing in major Asian countries 2 and the US as indicated above. In addition, the Committee highlighted the binding constraints on the domestic economy namely; infrastructure inadequacy, lack of access to finance, lack of requisite skills, unfavourable trade policy and a poor investment climate all of which have the potential to constrain economic growth. The MPC, therefore, stressed the need for government to pursue macroeconomic, structural and institutional reforms that appear to have slowed down in the past few years. The year-on-year headline inflation declined to 110 per cent in May 2010 from 125 per cent in April and 118 per cent in March. Similarly core inflation fell to 88 per cent in May 2010 from 98 per cent in April and 95 per cent in March. The downward trend in the domestic price level could be attributed to a number of factors, including the continuing underperformance of monetary aggregates, with the associated constrained demand, adequate food supply, stable exchange rates and improvement in the availability of petroleum products, amongst others. Notwithstanding these developments, the MPC reiterated its earlier position on the threat of inflationary pressure arising from several factors including the announcement effect of salary increase in the civil service and the rising food prices against the backdrop of the famine in neighboring Niger Republic. The Committee restated its commitment to continue to monitor price developments with a view to taking appropriate measures to stem any inflationary threat and ensure that the downside risk of inflation to growth is minimized. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments: Provisional data showed that relative to end-December 2009, broad money (M2) declined by 02 per cent in May 2010, which, when annualized represented a contraction of 048 per cent, compared with the indicative growth target of 2926 per cent for 2010. Reserve money (RM), which stood at N1,,66850 billion at end-December 2009, declined to N1,,51655 billion at end-April and N1,,53479 billion at end-May 2010. As at June 23, 2010, the RM level of N1,,61802 billion was below the provisional 2010 second quarter indicative benchmark of N1,,87280 billion by 136 per cent. Available data showed that in May 2010, aggregate domestic credit (net) grew by 1238 per cent over the December 2009 level, and by 2972 per cent when annualized, which was still below the 2010 indicative target of 5554 per cent. Credit to government (net), which grew substantially by 5087 per cent over end-December 2009 (or 1221 per cent on annualized basis), was the major contributor. Credit to the private sector declined by 188 per cent (or 451 per cent on annualized basis), in contrast to the growth benchmark of 3154 per cent for 2010. The substantial growth of credit to government (net) against the backdrop of declining private sector credit reflected the risk aversion of the DMBs to lending to non-government borrowers. The Committee believes that in order to provide the private sector with the necessary credit to grow the economy, further efforts are needed to unlock the credit market in order to enhance the flow of credit to the real economy. The rates at the inter-bank segments of the money market were much higher than what obtained in the preceding period owing to the short-lived tight liquidity conditions in May 2010. Consequently in May 2010, the average inter-bank call and Open-Buy-Back (OBB) rates rose significantly to 597 and 492 per cent, respectively, representing increases of 470 and 381 basis points above the 127 and 111 per cent recorded in the preceding month. In line with the increase in rates at the inter-bank call and OBB segments, the 7- and 30- day NIBOR rates increased by 397 and 311 basis points to 643 and 824 per cent, respectively, from 246 and 513 per cent in April. However with the release of statutory revenue in the last week of May, the banking system became liquid. As a result, the average inter-bank call and OBB rates declined from 771 and 707 per cent, respectively on May 25, 2010 to 117 and 110 per cent on June 1, 2010. Thereafter rates remained stable and low, hovering around an average of 120 per cent. Developments in interest rates structure indicated that the retail lending rates were still relatively high even though they were declining. The average maximum lending rate dropped to 2256 per cent in May 2010, from 2345 percent in December, 2009. Also the average prime lending rate dropped to 1877 per cent in May 2010, from 1903 per cent in December 2009. Similarly, the weighted average savings rate dropped marginally to 292 per cent in May 2010 from 336 per cent in December 2009. The consolidated deposit rates declined to 330 per cent in May 2010 from 613 per cent in December 2009. Thus the spread between the average maximum lending rate and the consolidated deposit rate widened to 1927 per cent in May 2010 from 1734 per cent in December, 2009. The Committee noted that the key policy challenges remained the negative growth in money supply and private sector credit as well as the subsisting high lending rates in the face of declining inter-bank rates. The Nigerian capital market is still showing some signs of recovery. Market capitalization (MC)—equities only, increased by 249 per cent from N498 trillion to N628 trillion over the same period. The number of deals, volume and value of shares traded increased by 1634, 1923 and 10000 per cent, respectively. The increase in ASI and MC was principally due to share price increases in the Banking. Food & Beverage and Oil/Gas sectors. The Committee welcomed the continuing improvement in the stock market, and noted the potentials for further recovery given the passage of the harmonized Asset Management Corporation (AMCON) Bill by both chambers of the National Assembly. External Sector Developments: The foreign exchange market remained relatively stable in the first half the year. During the period- January 01 - June 16, 2010, total sales at 45 bi-weekly WDAS auctions amounted to US$11,,15510 million, equivalent to an average of US$24789 million per auction. In the corresponding period of 2009, the sum of US$12,,99548 million was sold at 70 daily and bi-weekly RDAS auctions, equivalent to an average of US$18565 million per auction. In May 2010, the average foreign exchange demand of US$45926 million per auction was recorded against the average sales of US$39445 million, representing sales as a 5 percentage of demand of 8589. As at June 23, 2010 average demand for the month dropped to US$31573 million and, correspondingly, the average sales also declined, to US$29769 million, representing sales as a percentage of demand of 9429 In June 2010, the WDAS rate opened at N15027US$1 (inclusive of 1% commission) and closed at N15009/US$1, at an average exchange rate of N15024/US$1 for the month. This represented an appreciation of 6 kobo (004 per cent) compared with the average closing rate of N15030/US$1 recorded in May 2010. The BDC segment of the market recorded average selling rates of N15326/US$1 and N15386/US$1 in the months of May and June 2010 respectively, representing a depreciation of 04 per cent. At the inter-bank market, the average selling rates for May and June 2010 were N15148/US$ and N15135 respectively, representing a 009 per cent appreciation. The WDAS and interbank segments of the foreign exchange market witnessed mild naira exchange rate appreciation while the BDC segment experienced mild depreciation. Thus the stability of the naira exchange rate attained in the foreign exchange market since the first half of 2009 continued in the first half of 2010. The Committee observed that the naira exchange rate has remained stable in all segments of the market during the review period, reflecting increased confidence in the Naira and the efficacy of the current exchange rate policy stance. It believes that the relative stability in the foreign exchange market is likely to be sustained in the near term. The Committee will, however, continue to monitor developments in the market to ensure that measures are taken to eliminate speculative demand and volatility in the market. The Gross external reserves stood at US$3763 billion on 23rd June, 2010 representing a decrease of US$119 billion or 306 per cent when compared with the level of US$3882 billion as at 31st May 2010. The Committee, however, noted that the current external reserves level is still adequate as it would finance 16 months of import, compared to the internationally recommended benchmark of 3 months of import cover for a country's external reserves. The Committee's Considerations Against the backdrop of the foregoing, the MPC noted with satisfaction the continued macroeconomic stability. It however, stressed the need to grow the real sector on a sustainable basis. It also reiterated the possible inflation risks highlighted at the last MPC meeting, in the light of the anticipated budget deficit and the operationalisation of the proposed Asset Management Corporation. However monetary aggregates are still under- performing and the Asset Management Corporation is yet to take-off. On balance, therefore, the inflation threat remained subdued in the short to medium term. In addition, some of the approved quantitative easing measures are yet to be completely implemented. The Committee, therefore, considered it appropriate to continue to monitor developments with a view to intervening as the need arises. Decisions In the light of the above, the Committee decided that : 1. No changes are made to the current policy stance viz: the MPR should remain unchanged at 60 per cent; and 2. The asymmetric corridor of 200 basis points above and 500 basis points below the MPR, respectively, are to be retained. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria Abuja July 5, 2010 7."
Georgia,2010-07-07,"07.07.10 The NBG keeps its policy rate (refinancing rate) unchanged at 6.25 percent The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on July 7, 2010 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 6.25. Consumer prices fell by 0.3 percent in June 2010 as compared to the previous month mainly due to the influence of seasonal factors. The abovementioned decline stemmed from the seasonality of agricultural products, which was partially offset by the increase in medicine prices. The annual inflation rate stood at 3.7 percent. Notwithstanding the recent decline of the inflation rate, according to the current forecasts, the increase in consumer prices will equal around 6 percent in medium term. In spite of decline, the growth rate of monetary aggregates remains high. GDP grew at the rate of 4.5 percent during the first quarter of the current year. The turnover of the VAT paying companies and the export and import statistics point towards a growing trend in economic activity. According to the preliminary information, loans to the economy have grown at the rate of 10% from the beginning of the year up to June. Loans denominated in Lari have grown by 26% and FX denominated loans have decreased by 3.2% taking into account exchange rate changes. Crude oil prices have been showing a declining trend recently. According to the existing forecasts, significant changes in oil prices are not expected during the year. The inflation rates in Georgia's main trade partners have also shown a declining trend. The base effect has played a considerable role in the increase of economic indicators and monetary aggregates, therefore, the information at this stage was deemed not sufficient to tighten the monetary policy. Due to the abovementioned and the fact that the monetary policy rate (the refinancing rate) has been increased by 125 basis points at the previous Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, the MPC decided to keep the rate unchanged. The NBG will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on July 21, 2010."
Euroarea,2010-07-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council views the current key ECB interest rates as appropriate. Taking into account all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 10 June 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the first half of 2010. Looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace, in an environment of high uncertainty. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Monetary policy will do all that is needed to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. This is the necessary and central contribution that monetary policy makes to fostering sustainable economic growth, job creation and financial stability. All the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions, referred to as “enhanced credit support” and the Securities Markets Programme, are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. We remain firmly committed to price stability over the medium to longer term. The monetary policy stance and the overall provision of liquidity will be adjusted as appropriate. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. After a period of sharp decline, euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009. Euro area real GDP increased, on a quarterly basis, by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2010, according to Eurostat's second estimate. The latest economic data and survey-based indicators suggest that a strengthening in economic activity took place during the spring. The Governing Council expects real GDP to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace over time and across economies and sectors of the euro area. The ongoing recovery at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports, together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system, should provide support to the euro area economy. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and labour market prospects. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to the economic outlook are broadly balanced, in an environment of high uncertainty. On the upside, the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected, thereby further supporting euro area exports. On the downside, concerns remain relating to renewed tensions in financial markets, with possible further adverse effects on financing conditions and confidence. In addition, a stronger or more protracted than previously expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances, may weigh on the downside. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.4% in June, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 1.6% in May. In the next few months annual HICP inflation rates are expected to display some further volatility, with a tendency towards somewhat higher rates later in the year. Looking ahead, in 2011 inflation rates should overall remain moderate, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced. Upside risks over the medium term relate, in particular, to the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. Overall, the Governing Council will monitor closely the future evolution of all available price indicators. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 was unchanged at -0.2% in May 2010. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased slightly further but, at 0.2%, remained weak. Together, these data continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. Shorter-term developments in M3 and some of its components and counterparts have remained volatile and, given the continued tensions in some financial market segments, this volatility may well persist. The previously strong impact of the interest rate constellation on monetary dynamics appears to be gradually waning. This implies that actual M3 growth is less affected than before by the downward impact of the steep yield curve and the associated allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside M3. Moreover, the impact that the narrow spreads between the interest rates paid on different M3 instruments have on shifts within M3 towards M1 should be diminishing. The still weak annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continues to conceal countervailing developments, with positive growth in loans to households and negative growth in loans to non-financial corporations. While the monthly flow in bank loans to non-financial corporations was positive in May, in the light of the volatility observed in recent months it is too early to judge whether this signals a turning point. A lagged response of loans to non-financial corporations to developments in economic activity is a normal feature of the business cycle. The data up to May confirm that the size of banks' overall balance sheets has increased since the turn of the year. The challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up. Where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In this respect, we welcome the decision announced by the European Council to publish, with the consent of the banks involved, the individual results of the stress test exercise for banks in the European Union carried out by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) in cooperation with the ECB. Appropriate action will have to be taken where needed. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks' resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth, job creation and financial stability. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 10 June 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. The latest information has also confirmed that the economic recovery in the euro area continued in the first half of 2010. Looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace, in an environment of high uncertainty. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. As regards fiscal policies, the focus clearly needs to be on ensuring the sustainability of public finances. In the current environment, all euro area countries must, as a minimum, comply with their fiscal consolidation plans as foreseen under the respective excessive deficit procedures. More ambitious targets, as already adopted by a number of countries, may become necessary where current plans fall short of meeting the main objective of halting and reversing the increase in the government debt ratio. Moreover, all countries must specify credible adjustment measures that are sufficient to attain their budgetary targets for 2010, 2011 and beyond, and must live up to their commitment to take additional measures, where needed, over the coming years. For the proper functioning of the euro area, and to strengthen the prospects for higher sustainable growth, the pursuit of far-reaching structural reforms is essential. Major reforms are particularly needed in those countries that have experienced competitiveness losses in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. Measures should ensure a wage bargaining process that allows wages to adjust flexibly to the unemployment situation and losses in competitiveness. Reforms to strengthen productivity growth would further support the adjustment process of these economies. Let me finally refer to the proposals submitted by the Governing Council to the Task Force on Economic Governance established by the European Council under the chairmanship of President Van Rompuy. In the view of the Governing Council, a quantum leap in terms of progress towards strengthening the institutional foundations of EMU is needed. It is essential that governance and enforcement structures in the economic policy framework of the euro area be strengthened. Reinforcing surveillance of national budgetary policies and ensuring rigorous compliance with the fiscal rules will be key. Furthermore, it is extremely important that close oversight of relative competitiveness developments be implemented and that a surveillance mechanism be established to address imbalances in the euro area countries. At the same time, it is important to establish an appropriate euro area crisis management framework that minimises moral hazard."
Malaysia,2010-07-08,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to raise the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 2.75 percent. The floor and ceiling rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly raised to 2.50 percent and 3.00 percent respectively. The global recovery has continued in the second quarter, supported by robust and broad-based growth in most emerging economies, in particular Asia , and a moderate recovery in the advanced economies. Nevertheless, volatility in the international financial markets has increased following concerns over the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in several advanced economies. These developments have raised uncertainties on the potential impact on the international financial system and the global economic activity. Going forward, while the assessment is for the global recovery to continue, there is increased risk that the global growth momentum could moderate. In the domestic economy, recent trends in industrial production, financing activity, labour market conditions and external trade indicate that economic activity has remained robust in the second quarter. Going forward, while external developments may result in some moderation in the pace of growth, the domestic economy is expected to remain strong with continued improvements in private consumption and investment, and augmented by public investment spending. Domestic inflation recorded modest increases in April and May, mostly on account of supply factors. Prices are expected to rise at a gradual pace in the coming months, in line with the continued improvement in domestic economic conditions, and taking into account possible adjustments in administered prices. Overall, inflation is, however, expected to remain moderate going into 2011. The MPC considers the new level of the OPR to be appropriate and consistent with the current assessment of the growth and inflation prospects. The stance of monetary policy continues to remain accommodative and supportive of economic growth. Bank Negara Malaysia 08 July 2010."
Peru,2010-07-08,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2010 BCRP RAISED THE REFERENCE RATE TO 2.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy reference rate from 1.75 percent to 2.0 percent This measure is mainly preventive given the strong dynamism of domestic demand and implies maintaining monetary stimulus in a context in which no inflationary pressures are observed. Future adjustments in the reference interest rate will depend on new information on the evolution of macroeconomic indicators and their impact on inflation determinants. Uncertainty persists in international financial markets and so does uncertainty about the impact that this might have on global economic recovery. Private and public expenditure have been recording a significant growth so far this year, as reflected in current and advanced indicators of production which show a rapid recovery of the economy. Indicators worth pointing out include the growth of manufacturing, increased demand for electricity and for imports, and greater dynamism in the construction sector. Inflation in June registered a rate of 0.25 percent, mainly due to the rise of food prices associated with supply factors. With this, annual inflation increased to 1.64 percent. Core inflation, which showed a rate of 0.13 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 1.79 percent and remains around the 2 percent target. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to raise the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 2.80 percent. Overnight deposits: 1.20 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for August on its session of August 5, 2010."
Armenia,2010-07-09,"Press Release 07.09.2010 In the September 7, 2010 meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 7.25 percent. In August of 2010, 1.3 percent inflation was recorded, while the 12-month inflation indicator has grown by 1.8 pp against the previous month's respective indicator and amounted to 9.6 percent. The Board stated that acceleration of the 12-month inflation has been a result of price increases in items such as “Bread products”, “Vegetable and potato” and “Fruit” which were driven by developments in world food markets and in agriculture. The Board estimates that though the inflation indicator exceeds the upper border of the target it, however, derives from supply shocks, which is less likely to have a lasting character. It is expected that in the upcoming months the 12-month inflation would slow down gradually and reach the upper border of the target band within the forecast one-year horizon. Meantime, the Board's consensus is that slowly recovering domestic demand is not creating inflationary pressures yet. Even more so, the tightening of monetary conditions since the start of the year as well as current developments in currency market are further fostering moderation of the inflation environment. In consideration of inflation that accelerates totally due to supply-side factors as well as uncertainties over future developments in world food markets, the Board found it reasonable to further withhold from changing monetary conditions.

South Korea,2010-07-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate from 2.00% of its current level to 2.25%. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate from 2.00% of its current level to 2.25%. In the global economy, emerging market economies have sustained their favorable performance, while the economies of major advanced countries such as the US have largely continued their recovery trend. The risks that international financial market unrest due to the government debt problems in some European countries and heightened volatility of growth in economic activity in major countries recur at any time cannot be ruled out. The upward trend of domestic economic activity has been maintained. Exports have held to their strong upward track, domestic demand such as consumption and investment has steadily increased and, led by the private sector, labor market conditions have shown an improving trend. Domestic economic activity is expected to continue on an upward track, even with the presence of overseas risk factors. Consumer price inflation has so far remained in a range of somewhat above 2% but a little below 3%, but in the future, upward pressures are expected to build continuously owing to the increase in demand-pull pressures associated with the continued upturn in economic activity. In the real estate market, housing sales prices have declined in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while those in other areas have sustained a highly upward trend. In the financial markets, long term market interest rates have increased, reflecting domestic economic conditions and, stock prices and exchange rates have exhibited high volatility due to the influence of overseas risk factors. The scale of the growth in mortgage lending has widened in response chiefly to low lending rates, even though house transactions have been inactive. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain the accommodative policy stance in such a way as to help the economy sustain its sound growth on a foundation of price stability and, in carrying out policy, it will take overall account of financial and economic conditions at home and abroad."
Armenia,2010-07-13,"Press Release 13.07.2010 In the July 13, 2010 meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 7.25 percent. In June of 2010, 0.8 percent deflation was recorded, while the 12-month inflation has dropped by 0.5 pp against the previous month's indicator, ana amounted to 5.8 percent. The Board's consensus is that continued tightening of monetary conditions since the start of the year, falling international prices of raw materials and food products as well as diminishing effects of monetary and fiscal policies implemented in 2009 have all resulted in faster-than- forecast decline in the 12-month inflation, albeit it still outstrips the upper border of the band. The Board estimates that though the above factors will have their influence in the upcoming period of time, gradual recovery of aggregate demand and dynamics of prices of seasonal agricultural products, however, tend to create inflationary pressures. On the other hand, still uncertain is the behavior of the European currency and international prices of raw materials and food products. Under such circumstances the Board finds it reasonable to further withhold from changing monetary conditions. The Central Bank Public Relations."
Philippines,2010-07-14,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. The policy rates have been steady since July 2009. The Monetary Board's decision was based on its assessment that current monetary policy settings continue to be appropriate, given the favorable inflation outlook and on-target inflation expectations. The latest BSP projections show inflation staying within the target ranges of 4.5 ± 1 percent for 2010 and 4 ± 1 percent for 2011. Recent surveys also show that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored within the inflation targets over the policy horizon. The Monetary Board also noted that the uncertainty over the strength and pace of the global economic recovery warranted maintaining current policy settings. At the same time, the Monetary Board observed that upward inflation pressures are present, including stronger-than-anticipated domestic economic activity and buoyant consumer and business sentiment. Other upside risks include rising liquidity and strengthening credit activity, recovering global commodity prices, power rate hikes, and declines in agricultural output due to adverse weather conditions. Looking ahead, the BSP will continue to closely monitor emerging price pressures and coordinate as necessary with concerned government agencies on possible measures to address supply-side concerns. It will also continue to carefully keep track of domestic liquidity conditions given the prospect of strong foreign exchange inflows. The Monetary Board stands ready to adjust monetary policy settings as needed to safeguard the BSP's price stability objective."
Thailand,2010-07-14,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 14 July 2010 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Assistant Governor. Bank of Thailand, announces the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, as follows. The global economy continued to recover during the first half of the year and is expected to grow favourably this year. However key risks to global growth include the winding down of fiscal stimulus measures in many countries, and problems related to sovereign debt and financial institutions in some European economies. Meanwhile Asian economies have been expanding robustly, with more evident signs of inflationary pressure in the periods ahead. The impact of domestic political situation on the Thai economy in the second quarter proved to be limited. The tourism industry has shown signs of a quick recovery, while consumption and production were little affected and projected to expand for the rest of the year. Exports and private investment have been growing continuously. Overall the growth of the Thai economy is therefore projected to be higher than previously anticipated Although inflationary pressure remains modest at present, it is expected to rise next year in line with robust economic expansion. The MPC judges that the economic recovery has become more evident and the economy should continue to grow, thus lessening the need for an exceptionally accommodative monetary policy. With a view to bringing policy interest rate closer to normal levels, the MPC therefore decided to raise the policy interest rate by 025 per cent per annum, from 125 to 150 per cent per annum, effective immediately."
Chile,2010-07-15,"Central Bank of Chile Press Release* Santiago, 15 July 2010 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points to 1.50 (annual). Internationally, volatility in financial markets associated with the economic situation in Europe remains high, and uncertainty persists around its effect on the world economic outlook. Overall, the prices of copper and oil are high, and the external scenario facing the Chilean economy continues to be favorable. Domestically, available data show significant output and demand dynamism, within the ranges foreseen in the latest Monetary Policy Report. In June, the CPI posted zero variation, slightly below market expectations, while the various measures of core inflation showed positive figures. Private expectations toward the end of the policy horizon are consistent with y-o-y inflation levels around 3%. The Board will continue to reduce the current significant monetary policy stimulus at a pace that will depend on the unfolding of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions. Accordingly, the Board reiterates that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Turkiye,2010-07-15,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep one-week repo auction rate (the policy rate) and overnight rates unchanged as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 7 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 6.50 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 2.50 percent, lending rate at 12 percent, d) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent. Recent data suggest that the recovery in economic activity is ongoing. While domestic demand is displaying a relatively stable growth, there are signs of a partial slowdown in external demand. Therefore, it would take a while before industrial capacity utilization rates return to pre-crisis levels. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates remain at high levels. Moreover, risks regarding global economy persist. The Committee has indicated that the core inflation indicators remain consistent with the medium term targets. This development, coupled with the fall in unprocessed food prices and easing commodity prices, has led to a more favorable inflation outlook than envisaged in the April Inflation Report. In light of these developments, the Committee reiterated that it may be necessary to maintain policy rates at current levels for some time, and to keep them at low levels for a long period. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Georgia,2010-07-21,"21.07.10 The NBG Raises its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) to 6.50 Percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on July 21, 2010 and decided to raise its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) to 6.50 percent. Taking into consideration the existing signs of economic recovery during the first half of the year, the forecasted GDP growth rate for 2010 stands at 4.6 percent. Economic growth during the current year has largely been a result of trade, manufacturing, transport and financial sectors. It is expected that in the medium term inflation should stay within the 6 percent range, although minor upward risks do exists. Despite the small decrease, annual growth rate of the monetary aggregates still remains high. The growth of the money supply is on the one hand a result of fiscal economic stimulus, and on the other hand, of increased lending to the economy from the beginning of the year. Inflows resulting from expedited money transfers increased in June. A reduction in inflows from Greece. Spain and Ukraine is notable, which mainly is a result of existing economic conditions. According to the available information, risks for future economic scenario are at both directions. On the one hand, the growth in monetary aggregates and lending to the economy is a sign of quick economic recovery, although on the other hand, prospect for foreign direct investment still unclear. The NBG will closely monitor developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on August 18, 2010."
Mongolia,2010-07-22,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Ref No: 2010/07 Date: July 22, 2010 Embargo: Not for publication or broadcast before 1100 hours on Thursday, 23 July 2010. The Board of Directors decided to increase the policy rate to 11% at its meeting on July 22 of 2010. The y-o-y inflation of Ulaanbaatar was 12.5% by June of this year. In order to prevent from the second round effects of the supply factors and to lower the pressure and expectation of the inflation caused by the allowance distribution of Human Development Fund, the Central Bank has begun taking the steps to tighten the monetary policy from this May. Under the scope of mid-term budget approved by the Parliament in July, the monetary policy is not be tightened again through limiting the 5% deficit in 2011, 11% in 2012 and 5% in 2013. Due to the Government actions to improve the supply of food products, the inflation growth has been decelerated in the first quarter of 2010. In the first half of 2010, the increase of 13.4% in y-o-y and 9.6% y-to-date in loans outstanding and the rise of 12.4% in y-o-y in production sectors show the increasing sign in private sector. Continuing the measures to improve the supply of food products is the main condition to stabilize and decrease the inflation caused by supply sectors. The Central Bank stresses the importance of structural bottleneck in infrastructure and the enhancement of supply capacity to keep the activation with no inflation pressure. Since the low and sustainable inflation protects the real income of the population and the economic stability in mid and long terms, the Central Bank would strictly keep implementing the policy to limit the inflation. In future, the Bank of Mongolia takes the necessary actions at the appropriate time. THE BANK OF MONGOLIA."
South Africa,2010-07-22,"International news and discourse are currently dominated by global economic and financial market developments, which continue to weigh on domestic economic growth prospects. Although the immediate concerns relating to the sovereign debt crisis seems to have abated somewhat, significant risks remain. Furthermore, growth in a number of advanced economies appears to be losing some momentum following promising outcomes in the first quarter of the year. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas declined to 4,6 per cent in May 2010 from 4,8 per cent in the previous month. The main contributors to the inflation outcome were the categories of housing and utilities (mainly electricity) and miscellaneous goods and services (predominantly insurance costs) which together contributed almost 60 per cent to the total inflation outcome. Categories exhibiting very low inflation pressures included food and non-alcoholic beverages, communication and recreation and culture. Indicators of core inflation show that inflation is generally subdued, with CPI excluding food, petrol and energy declining to 4,3 per cent in May compared with 4,7 per cent in the previous month. Inflation excluding all administered prices measured 3,4 per cent. Producer prices continued the upward trend seen in the past few months, and measured 6,8 per cent in May 2010, compared with 5,5 per cent in April. These increases were driven mainly by commodity and electricity price developments. Food price inflation remained low, with agricultural prices increasing by 0,3 per cent on a year-on-year basis, while manufactured food prices declined by 1,3 per cent over the same period. This suggests that food prices at the consumer level are likely to remain contained for some time. The CPI forecast of the South African Reserve Bank (the Bank) indicates a relatively unchanged forecast compared with that presented to the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). CPI inflation is expected to average 4,5 per cent in the third quarter of 2010, and then increase moderately thereafter. Inflation is expected to remain within the target range during the forecast period, and to measure 5,3 per cent in the final quarter of 2012. Despite the persistent moderation of inflation within the target range, inflation expectations have remained relatively elevated, albeit with a slight downward trend. According to the survey of inflation expectations conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at Stellenbosch University during the second quarter of 2010, average inflation expectations for both 2010 and 2011 have declined by 0,2 percentage points to 6,3 per cent and 6,5 per cent respectively, but have remained unchanged at 6,8 per cent in 2012. Financial analysts are the only category of survey respondents that expect the inflation target to be achieved during the forecast period. Expectations derived from the markets are similar to those of the financial analysts. The break-even inflation rates, as measured by the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation-linked bonds, have declined since the previous meeting of the MPC, and reflect an expectation of the continued attainment of the inflation target over the medium term, although close to the upper end of the range. The global economic growth outlook remains uncertain. In its July update of the World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund raised the forecast for global growth from 4,2 per cent to 4,6 per cent, mainly on the basis of the higher-than-expected performance in the first quarter of the year. However, some moderation is expected in the second half of this year with a high degree of downside risk. The sovereign debt crisis in Europe appears to have had a short-term respite, but significant longer term risks and uncertainties persist. The planned fiscal consolidation and austerity programmes in a number of countries are expected to lead to persistently low growth for some time. The economic growth prospects in the United States appear weaker than anticipated, with particular concerns about the continued weakness in the housing market, and an outlook described by US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke as “unusually uncertain”. At the same time the Chinese authorities have taken steps to moderate the pace of economic growth. The expectation is that we are likely to see an extended period of below-potential growth in a number of regions. Under these circumstances, global inflationary pressures are expected to remain subdued and are not seen to pose a risk to the domestic inflation environment. The weaker demand conditions are also likely to constrain global commodity price developments, including international oil prices. The price of Brent crude oil has been relatively stable for some time and has averaged around US$74 per barrel since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, down from the US$82 per barrel average that prevailed during the period between the March and May MPC meetings. The continued low interest rate environment prevailing in the US and euro zone has resulted in a consistent search for yield, with a number of emerging markets being the recipients of significant capital inflows. South Africa has been no exception. Since the beginning of the year, non-residents have been net purchasers of bonds and equities to the value of around R72 billion, of which about R51 billion were bond purchases. The rand exchange rate was relatively volatile in the period since the previous meeting of the MPC, with the rand/dollar exchange rate fluctuating between around R8,10 and R7,43. However, since the beginning of June, the rand has been relatively stable and averaged around R7,60 per US dollar. Much of the underlying volatility can be ascribed to changes in global risk aversion related to events in Europe in particular, which saw a high degree of volatility in the US dollar/euro exchange rate. As a consequence, the rand has fluctuated against other currencies as well. Since the beginning of the year the rand has appreciated against the euro and pound sterling by 9,1 per cent and 2,9 per cent respectively, while it has depreciated by 2,9 per cent against the dollar over the same period. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand has appreciated by about 1,6 per cent since the beginning of the year. The Bank is very aware of the impact of both the level and volatility of the rand on the economy, particularly the manufacturing, export and import-competing sectors. We are ready to continue to play our part in a considered manner, and discussions with the National Treasury about the various options available to address these issues, as well as the availability of resources to do so are ongoing. While a range of levels have been proposed by various interest groups or analysts as desired or equilibrium levels  anything from R10,50 to R8,50 against the US dollar - we reiterate that we do not have a target level for the rand. It is very difficult to define with precision the degree of over- or undervaluation of an exchange rate. The approach when assessing this should be guided by a sense of when the value is clearly not consistent with equilibrium, which itself changes from time to time. Moreover, it is important to not underestimate how difficult it is to achieve a particular range of a weaker currency, or how costly this can be. Any actions would also have to be consistent with the inflation target, as there is no point in having a weaker currency if the benefits are simply eroded by inflation. The recovery in domestic economic growth has continued. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annualised rate of 4,6 per cent in the first quarter of 2010, driven mainly by the recovery in the manufacturing and mining sectors. However indications are that second quarter growth was likely to have been less favourable, and the negative output gap is expected to persist for some time. The Bank forecasts economic growth to average around 2,9 per cent during 2010, with the uncertainties emanating from the global economy posing the main downside risks. The relatively unfavourable outlook can be ascribed in part to an expected slowdown in the manufacturing sector. Growth in this sector in the three months to May 2010 compared with the previous three months, measured 1,2 per cent. The Kagiso/BER Purchasing Managers Index has been moderating consistently since its peak in February 2010, and in July the index reflected an expectation of a contraction in the sector. The construction sector also remains under pressure, as evidenced in the 29,9 per cent year-on-year decline in total building plans passed in May. Civil construction is also showing declining activity and according to the FNB civil construction survey, the industry is experiencing unsatisfactory business conditions. The RMB/BER business confidence index also declined during the second quarter of 2010. Private sector gross fixed capital formation continued to decline in the first quarter of 2010, albeit at a slower rate of contraction. There are signs of recovery in domestic household consumption expenditure. In the first quarter of 2010, consumption expenditure grew at a higher than expected annualised rate of 5,7 per cent. The recovery was fairly broad-based except for expenditure on services which remained relatively subdued. The positive trend is expected to have been maintained in the second quarter. Retail trade sales increased at a year-on-year rate of 4,6 per cent in May. However when comparing the three months to May with the preceding three months an increase of 0,3 per cent was recorded. Consumption expenditure is expected to have received a boost from the 2010 FIFA World Cup. New vehicle sales increased by 20,7 per cent on a year-on-year basis in June, although they declined by 9,7 per cent relative to the previous month. The BER retail survey suggests that the outlook for the sector remains fragile. After two consecutive positive quarters, retail business confidence declined in the second quarter of 2010, and overall business conditions, sales volumes and profitability performed worse than expected. The outlook for household consumption expenditure is being affected by contradictory forces. Positive factors include lower interest rates, lower inflation, positive wealth effects arising from favourable house price and equity market developments, and high levels of real wage increases for those in employment. In the first quarter of 2010, unit labour costs increased by 9,6 per cent compared with the same quarter a year ago. According to Andrew Levy publications, the average wage settlement rate amounted to 8,2 per cent in the first half of 2010, compared with 9,3 per cent for 2009 as a whole. Wage expectations also remain elevated, according to the BER inflation expectations survey. Factors constraining consumption expenditure include continued job losses and high levels of household debt and low levels of credit extension to the private sector. According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa, employment levels declined further in the first quarter of 2010, as private sector employment contracted for the seventh consecutive quarter. Growth in bank credit extension to the private sector turned positive in May when growth over twelve months in total loans and advances measured 1,4 per cent, mainly as a result of an increase in credit extension to the corporate sector. Twelve-month growth in mortgage advances has remained stable at levels around 3 per cent since November 2009. There are some indications, as evidenced in the most recent Ernst & Young/BER financial services survey, that in the second quarter of 2010 retail banks loosened their credit criteria somewhat. However, bank lending to consumers may be constrained by the persistently relatively high levels of impaired advances, particularly in relation to retail loans. Demand for loans may have also been negatively affected by the continued high levels of household debt which measured 78,4 per cent of disposable income in the first quarter of 2010. The main upside risks to the inflation outlook continue to emanate from cost push pressures, particularly recent wage settlements and high levels of administered price increases. The Monetary Policy Committee assesses the risks to the inflation outlook as being evenly balanced and views the current monetary policy stance as appropriate. Therefore, the MPC decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6,5 per cent per annum. The committee is aware of the fragilities and vulnerabilities to the domestic economy, driven in part by global uncertainties. The committee will continue to assess economic and financial developments and should circumstances warrant it, the appropriate response will be taken, consistent with the Bank’s inflation targeting mandate."
Israel,2010-07-26,"26.07.2010 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for August 2010 to 1.75 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for August 2010 willbe increased by 25 basis points to 1.75 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The June CPI rose by 0.3 percent, within the range of forecasts of 0.1 percent to 0.4 percent. The housing index rose by 0.6 percent, and since the beginning of the year it has risen by 2.2 percent. Inflation in the last twelve months, 2.4 percent, was within the target range; adjusting for the effects of changes in indirect taxes and surcharges, inflation was 2.2 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts:The Bank of Israel and the private forecasters expect inflation measured over the previous twelve months to continue to decline in the next few months. However, forecasters' expectations of the rate of inflation in the next twelve months' indices (July 2010 to June 2011) rose significantly, from an average of 2.6 percent at the end of June to an average of 3.2 percent in mid-July. Inflation expectations derived from the capital market continued to move around the upper limit of the inflation target. In the next three months the forecasters, on average, expect inflation of 1 percent. With regard to the Bank of Israel interest rate, expectations calculated from the capital market are that the interest rate a year hence will be 2.5 percent. The forecasters, on average, expect an increase of 0.4 percentage points in the interest rate in the next three months; they expect the rate to be 2 percent at the end of 2010, and 2.7 percent in a year's time. Real economic activity: Indicators of economic activity that became available during the past month support the assessment that business activity continued to grow in the second quarter of 2010. Most of the indicators present a positive picture but some suggest the possibility that growth slowed, perhaps significantly, during the second quarter. Increased activity in the second quarter was reflected in the data of the Bank of Israel's Companies Survey and in the continued increase in the index of manufacturingproduction. That said, there is doubt whether the rate of recovery evidenttill recently will continue, due to the decline in the Purchasing ManagersIndex, the standstill in exports in the second quarter and expectations that this will continue (according to the Companies Survey), the downward revision of the composite state-of-the-economy indices for both March and April to 0 percent, and the minimal rise of 0.1 percent in the June index. Gross domestic VAT revenue in the last three months also declined by 5 percent compared with the previous three months, but these revenues are still 11 percent higher than in the equivalent period last year. The labor market and wages: Most of the sources that had indicated a slowdown in the recovery in the labor market in the first quarter showed a return to a more rapid recovery in the second quarter. These include inparticular the unemployment trend data for June, which shows a decline in unemployment to 6.5 percent, and also the Manufacturers Association survey of expectations; the Bank of Israel Companies Survey, with reports of a more significant increase in employment in the second quarter; the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of vacancies, which shows a faster increase in thenumber of employees and in the number of vacancies in April-June, in contrast to the moderation in the rate of increase reported in the survey for the first quarter; and. Although the real and nominal wage fell by 2 percent in April from their March levels due to the decline in the businesssector wage, this followed a marked increase in the first quarter. The number of employee posts increased in February to April by 2.5 percent in annual terms, relative to the previous three months. Budget data: From the beginning of 2010 until June the domestic deficit was NIS 8.7 billion, compared with NIS 15.5 billion in the equivalent period in 2009. On the basis of the current data, the deficit in 2010 is expected to be about 4 percent of GDP. At the beginning of July, the government approved the proposed budget for the next two years (2011-12),which is consistent with a decline in the deficit to 3 percent and 2 percent of GDP in 2011 and 2012 respectively. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on June 27 until July 25, the shekel appreciated by 0.4 percent against the dollar, at a time when most currencies worldwide strengthened markedly against the dollar; the shekel depreciated by 4.6 percent against the euro, in line with the trend in the international markets. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel weakened by about 2.1 percent, as a result of its marked depreciation against the euro. The capital and money markets:Between the monetary policy discussions of June 27 and July 25, the Tel Aviv 25 index rose by 3 percent, and the Tel Aviv 100 index by 1.8 percent, in line with the rises in many stock markets around the world during that period. Yields on Israel government bonds declined this month along both the nominal and indexed yield curves, particularly at the short end of the nominal term structure. The yield gap between Israeli and US unindexed 10-year government bonds widened this month to 160 basis points (b.p.), as a result of sharper declines in yields in the US. The positive trend in corporate bond issues was reflected in a considerable increase in issues in July, mainly of indexed bonds. The Tel-Bond 20 index rose by 1.23 percent over the period, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 1.74 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, remained unchanged this month at 115 b.p., in line with the trend in risk premiums around the world. The money supply: The M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) fell by 2 percent in June, following its 1 percentincrease in May; in the last twelve months it increased by 9 percent. The M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) declined by 1.5 percent in June, following its 0.4 percent rise in May; in the last twelvemonths it increased by 2.3 percent. The credit market: Total outstanding business sector credit remained steady in May at NIS 739 billion, following its 0.8 percent increase inApril. Bank credit accounted for NIS 389 billion, a decline of 0.6 percentfrom its April level, compared to an increase of 1.1 percent from March toApril. Outstanding nonbank credit (corporate bonds and nonbank loans) declined slightly in May to NIS 218 billion. Between the beginning of 2009 and May 2010 credit to households, led by housing credit, has increased by a cumulative 10.6 percent, in line with the increases of 6.5 percent in 2007 and of 7 percent in 2008. The rate of new mortgages taken in the previous twelve months continues to rise. The total value of mortgages given in the first half of 2010 was 52 percent greater than that in the first half of 2009,partly due to the increase in apartment prices. The housing market: House prices, which are measured by the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices (which are not included in the CPI) increased by 1.2 percent in April, continuing the increase evident in the last sixteen months. According to the survey, house prices have risen by 21 percent in the last year. A recent examination of house prices shows that their level is not significantly different from that compatible withthe fundamental economic conditions. The rate of increase, however, also in April, continues to be very rapid, and if prices continue to rise at the current pace they are likely to deviate from the level consistent with the basic economic conditions. The global economy: There are growing signs that the pace of the global recovery is slowing. The background to the slowdown in growth is weaker-than-expected macroeconomic data from the US, the ending of government rescue programs, contractionary measures introduced in the Chinese economy,the continuing uncertainty over the fiscal crisis in some European countries, and policies to reduce deficits in those countries. Forecasts this month tended to predict lower levels of global growth than forecasts earlier in the year. Nonetheless, global growth is expected to continue in the next few months, mainly due to the very low interest environment and continued rapid growth in East Asia. In light of the high rate of growth in the first quarter of 2010, the IMF revised its forecast of global growth in 2010 from 4.2 percent to 4.6 percent , and left its forecast for 2011 unchanged. In contrast the foreign investment houses began to lower their forecasts of growth in various economies. Capital markets continued to be very volatile. Trade in shares was characterized by rising prices, against the background of some easing of the European debt crisis and buoyant company reports for the second quarter. The investment houses expect the positive atmosphere in capital markets to continue in the short term. Global inflation remains low, against the background of the apparent slowdown in the rate of global recovery, the general stability of commodity prices, and the output gaps in the advanced economies. Against this background, the leading central banks' transition to increases in interest rates has been deferred further. Some other central banks, however, increased their interest rates this month, and further increases are expected in the coming months. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to increase the interest rate for August to 1.75 percent isconsistent with the gradual process of returning the interest rate to a more 'normal' level, intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to contribute to the further recovery of economic activity, while supporting financial stability. The path of the interest rate will be determined in accordance with the inflation environment, the entrenchment of growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the leading central banks, and in light of developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. Atthe current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. Inflation forecasts of the Bank of Israel and of the private forecasters and expectations derived from the capital market for one year ahead are around the upperlimit of the target inflation range. The Bank of Israel's assessment of inflation in the next twelve months was revised upwards in light of the weakness of the shekel (in terms of the effective exchange rate) in the last month, the continued increase in house prices, and the planned hikes in indirect taxes. Housing prices and the housing index (rents) are continuing to increase rapidly, together with a rapid expansion of housing credit. Data on real activity that became available this month present a mixed picture. Some indicate continued expansion and a further decline in unemployment, while others point to a slowdown in activity, and particularly in exports. An analysis of the whole range of data leads to the assessment that positive growthwill continue in accordance with the Bank's previous forecasts, with a gradual contraction of the output gap. Interest rates of the central banks of the major advanced economies are at very low levels, and in light of recent developments are expected to remain so for some considerable time. That said, central banks in several countries that are already growing relatively rapidly continued with the process of increasing their interest rates last month too, and are expected to continue to do so in the near future. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic and financial developments, and will use the instruments available to itto achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on August 9, 2010. The decision regarding the interest rate for September 2010 will bepublished at 17:30 on Monday. August 23, 2010. 26.07.2010 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for August 2010 to 1.75 percent. The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for August 2010 to 1.75 percent.

India,2010-07-27,"First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2010-11: Press Statement by Dr.D. Subbarao. Governor ""This morning, the Reserve Bank rel eased the First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2010-11 at a meeting of the chief executives of major banks. The important decisions contained in the review were to raise the repo rate from 5.5 per cent to 5.75 per cent and the reverse repo rate from 4 per cent to 4.50 per cent. This asymmetric raise in rates narrows the LAF corridor from 150 basis points to 125 basis points. Balance of Policy Stance 2. The dominant concern that has shaped the monetary policy stance in this review is high inflation. Even as food price inflation and, more generally, consumer price inflation, have shown some moderation, they are still in double digits. Non-food inflation has risen, and demand side pressures are clearly evident. With growth taking firm hold, the balance of policy stance has to shift decisively to containing inflation and anchoring inflationary expectations. Global Outlook 3. Since our last policy review in April, the macroeconomic environment has changed significantly. In the aftermath of the Greek sovereign debt crisis and other visible soft spots in Europe and the US, there is renewed uncertainty about the sustainability of the recovery. In contrast. EMEs are witnessing strong growth, driven by rising domestic demand, restocking of inventories and, thus far, recovering global trade. The relatively rapid recovery in EMEs has also been accompanied by higher inflation. Overall, though, there is widespread expectation of a slowdown of the global economy in the second half of 2010. Indian Economy Growth 4. The macroeconomic developments in India are contrarian to the global trend. We have recovered faster, but our inflation rate has also been higher. The recovery process has consolidated and become more broad-based since April 2010. A big ‘known unknown' in April 2010 was the outlook on monsoon. That has since become a ‘known known' in the sense that rainfall so far has been better than during last year, and the crop-wise area sown and the distribution of rainfall offer scope for cautious optimism on the agricultural front.2 5. Better farm sector prospects should lead to a pick-up in rural demand. This should give further momentum to the performance of the industrial sector which has been growing firmly. The strength of the recovery is also reflected in the sales and profitability growth of the corporate sector with more investment intentions being translated into action across a range of sectors. While domestic drivers of growth are robust, any slowdown in the global recovery will affect all EMEs, including India. Taking into account the above factors, the projection for real GDP growth for 2010-11 is revised to 8.5 per cent, up from our April policy projection of 8.0 per cent with an upside bias. This upward revision is primarily based on better industrial production and its favourable impact on the services sector while giving due consideration to the global scenario. Inflation 7. The developments on the inflation front are, however, worrisome. Let me explain. WPI inflation has been in double digits since February 2010. Primary food articles inflation, despite some moderation, continues to be in double digits. Between November 2009 and June 2010, non-food inflation rose from zero to 10.6 per cent and non-food manufactured inflation from zero to 7.3 per cent. Significantly, non-food items contributed over 70 per cent to WPI inflation in June 2010, suggesting that inflation is now very much generalised. Inflation in terms of all four consumer price indices remains in double digits notwithstanding some decline in recent months. Going forward, the outlook on inflation will be shaped by: the monsoon performance for the remaining period; movements in global energy and commodity prices, which have been showing distinct signs of softening over the past few weeks; and potential build-up in demand-side pressures with the strengthening of domestic growth drivers. Taking into account the emerging domestic and external scenario, the baseline projection for WPI inflation for March 2011 has been raised to 6.0 per cent from our April policy projection of 5.5 per cent. Monetary Aggregates 10. It is expected that even with the higher growth projection, monetary aggregates will evolve along the projected trajectory indicated in the April policy statement. Accordingly, for policy purposes, we have retained the earlier projections of money supply (M ) at 17 per cent and of non-food bank credit growth at 20 per 3 cent. Risk Factors 11. Let me indicate some important risks to the growth and inflation outlook. The first risk factor is that if the global recovery falters, the performance of EMEs is likely to be adversely affected, and a widespread slowdown in global trade will have an impact on the Indian manufacturing and service sectors too. The second risk factor is that an uncertain global situation will significantly reduce the flow of capital into EMEs. Such a slowdown in capital inflows will constrain domestic investment which is critical to achieving and sustaining high growth rates. This could potentially be a problem in India too since our rapid recovery has resulted in a widening of the current account deficit.3 It must be recognised though that the risk of capital flows runs both ways. It is quite possible that EMEs, including India, will receive more flows than they need because of accommodative monetary policies of advanced country central banks for an extended period. Large capital inflows above the absorptive capacity of our economy will pose a challenge for monetary and exchange rate management, and also have implications for asset prices. In this scenario, a widening current account deficit will help absorb a larger proportion of the inflows. The third risk factor is on the inflation front. Softening of inflation in the months ahead is contingent on moderation of food prices which in turn will depend on a balanced spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall in the remaining period of this monsoon season. While on risk factors, we must note one important upside. If global growth does not pick up, commodity and energy prices will remain subdued. Furthermore, unutilised global capacity in several sectors will soften the prices of imports and put downward pressure on import substitutes. Monetary Policy Stance 12. The Reserve Bank began the reversal of its expansionary monetary policy in October 2009 and has calibrated the exit to India's specific growth-inflation dynamics. Today's policy action in particular has been informed by three major considerations: domestic economic recovery is firmly in place and is strengthening; there is a need to contain the demand-side inflationary pressures which are clearly evident; and despite the increase in the policy rates by 75 basis points cumulatively, it is imperative that we continue in the direction of normalising our policy instruments to a level consistent with the evolving growth and inflation scenario, while taking care not to disrupt the recovery. Our monetary policy actions are expected to: Moderate inflation by reining in demand pressures and inflationary expectations. ii) Maintain financial conditions conducive to sustaining growth. iii) Generate liquidity conditions consistent with more effective transmission of policy actions. iv) Restrict the volatility of short-term rates to a narrower corridor. Operating Procedures of Monetary Policy 14. Now let me turn to two new initiatives  one structural and the other on policy review and communication. The Reserve Bank's LAF operates in such a manner that as systemic liquidity alternates between surplus and deficit, even at the margin, the overnight call money rate alternates between the reverse repo rate and the repo rate. As the systemic4 liquidity transits from a uni-directional surplus mode to a bi-directional mode, it will have implications for the effectiveness of monetary transmission. In the context of the changing liquidity dynamics, the operation of the LAF needs to be studied. Accordingly, it is proposed to set up a Working Group to review the current operating procedure of monetary policy of the Reserve Bank, including the LAF. Mid-Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 16. The second new initiative relates to a more frequent policy review. While our scheduled policy announcements are quarterly, in recent years, there have been several occasions, including March and July 2010, when we had to take off-cycle monetary policy actions. One significant advantage of the quarterly schedule is that it allows us to bring the full range of inputs into the decision-making process. Nevertheless, in a rapidly evolving macroeconomic situation, we need to combine the rigour and comprehensiveness of the quarterly process with the responsiveness and flexibility of more frequent reviews. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank will now undertake mid-quarter reviews roughly at the interval of about one and half months after each quarterly review. As per schedule, mid-quarter reviews will be in June. September. December and March. They will be by way of a press release and will communicate our assessment of economic conditions more frequently, and will provide a rationale for either policy action or maintenance of the status quo. However, the Reserve Bank will have the flexibility, as always, to take swift and pre- emptive policy action, as and when warranted by the evolving macroeconomic developments. Discussions with Banks 17. Banks welcomed the Reserve Bank's policy stance. They agreed that the monetary measures announced by the Reserve Bank today were appropriate in light of the current global and domestic balance. They also indicated that credit growth has picked up, though it is yet to become broad-based. Apart from monetary measures, discussions with banks focused on four specific issues viz., liquidity situation and the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) corridor; Basel III norms; credit flows to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs); and base rate. Banks indicated that the liquidity situation may remain tight for some more time as deposit growth has lagged behind the credit growth. They felt that a narrower LAF corridor will restrict short-term interest rate volatility and improve monetary transmission. Banks mentioned that the impact of Basel III norms on Indian banks will not be significant. However, statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) assets need to be included in the liquidity coverage ratio. Credit portfolio in respect of MSMEs sector of many banks is growing at a rapid rate. The Reserve Bank emphasised that the pace of credit expansion to MSMEs should be sustained and banks should sensitise the frontline managers the importance of lending to MSMEs. Banks indicated that the transition to the base rate has been generally smooth, though there are issues relating to the existing loans."" G.

Egypt,2010-07-29,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release July 29, 2010 In its meeting held on July 29, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 825 percent and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 85 percen. Annual headline CPI registered 1066 percent in June compared to 1059 percent in May, which continues to be elevated reflecting the impact of last year's unfavorable shock related to fruits and vegetable. In the meantime, annual core CPI remains within the CBE's comfort zone, almost unchanged at 670 percent in Jun. Meanwhile annual real GDP growth recorded 58 percent in 2009/10 Q3 compared to the four year low of 41 percent witnessed in 2008/09 Q2, reflecting a steady improvement in economic activit. Looking ahead, unfolding global economic developments have created uncertainty about the nascent global recovery, which could potentially weigh on domestic investment and external deman. Against this background, the MPC assesses that inflationary pressures remain subdued and that the current level of policy interest rate is appropriate and supportive of the economic recovery while consistent with maintaining core inflation within the CBE's comfort zone in the medium-ter. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Division Chief.

Romania,2010-08-04,"In its meeting of August 4, 2010, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for August 6, 2010. Although the annual inflation rate fell to 4.38 percent in June from 4.42 percent in May and 5.2 percent in January, and the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation1 has hovered around two percent in the first half of this year, the increase in value added tax starting July 1, 2010, will trigger a significant but temporary pick-up in consumer price inflation. Thus, projections indicate an annual headline inflation of around 7.8 percent at the end of 2010. Against the background of the persistence of the negative output gap, a return of headline inflation on a downward path towards the 3 percent target by the end of 2011 is to be expected after the impact of the first- round effect of the VAT hike dissipates. The resumption of disinflation decisively hinges however on the efforts to offset the possible second-round effects of the VAT increase, along with reducing uncertainties related to the implementation of structural reforms and fiscal consolidation measures. In this context, the NBR Board has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 6.25 percent per annum and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. Also, as uncertainties related to the regional financial crisis have diminished and given a relative normalisation of money and foreign exchange markets, the NBR Board decided to ensure an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system. These decisions are aimed at ensuring appropriate real broad monetary conditions in order to firmly anchor inflation expectations and to maintain the annual headline inflation rate, recalculated by excluding the first-round effect of the VAT rate increase, on a path in line with medium-term inflation targets. In this context, the NBR Board reaffirms that the resumption of disinflation and restarting sustainable economic growth critically hinges on the firm implementation of fiscal consolidation measures, structural reforms and on improved absorption of European funds, in line with commitments set under the multilateral external financing arrangement with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions. Against this background, the NBR will vigilantly monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, via an adequate use of its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. At the same time, the NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses evolutions in the recent macroeconomic environment and the inflation outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The report will be released to the public in a press conference on August 6, 2010. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for September 29, 2010. 1) Calculated by the NBR by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index."
Czech Republic,2010-08-05,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 5th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 5 August 2010 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Bank Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.75%. Reasons for the decision Headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation will be at the 2% target over the monetary policy horizon. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates close to their current levels initially, followed by a gradual rise in rates as from 2011 H2. The message of the forecast Headline inflation will quickly rise over the forecast and at the end of 2010 it will temporarily exceed the inflation target. After the unwinding of these impacts, headline inflation will slow slightly and will be close to the inflation target. Monetary-policy relevant inflation will continuously grow over the forecast and will be approaching the target in 2011 H2. The economy has recovered from the recession, but the recovery is only modest and more robust economic growth can be expected only in 2011- 2012 The nominal exchange rate is gradually appreciating over the forecast horizon. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates close to their current levels initially, followed by a gradual rise in rates as from 2011 H2. Downside risks: current exchange rate developments planned fiscal consolidation Upside risk: commodity prices developments 13 Thank you for your attention More information about the forecast can be found at and in Inflation Report III/2010, to be published 13 August 2010."
Euroarea,2010-08-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council views the current key ECB interest rates as appropriate. Considering all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 8 July 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. The available economic data and survey-based indicators suggest a strengthening in economic activity in the second quarter of 2010, and the available data for the third quarter are better than expected. Looking further ahead, and taking into account a number of temporary factors, we continue to expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace, in an environment of uncertainty. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Monetary policy will do all that is needed to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. This is the necessary and central contribution that monetary policy makes to fostering sustainable economic growth, job creation and financial stability. All the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions, referred to as “enhanced credit support” and the Securities Markets Programme, are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. We remain firmly committed to price stability over the medium to longer term. The monetary policy stance and the overall provision of liquidity will be adjusted as appropriate. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. After a period of sharp decline, euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009. Euro area real GDP increased, on a quarterly basis, by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2010. The available economic data and survey-based indicators suggest a strengthening in economic activity in the second quarter of 2010 and the available data for the third quarter are better than expected. Looking further ahead, and taking into account temporary effects, the Governing Council continues to expect real GDP to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace over time and across economies and sectors of the euro area. Ongoing growth at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports, together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system, should continue to support the euro area economy. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and labour market prospects. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to the economic outlook are broadly balanced in an environment of uncertainty. On the upside, the global economy and foreign trade may recover more strongly than is now projected, thereby further supporting euro area exports. On the downside, concerns remain relating to the emergence of renewed tensions in financial markets, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 1.7% in July, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, from 1.4% in June, most likely owing to upward base effects in the energy and food components. In the next few months annual HICP inflation rates are expected to display some further volatility around the current level. Looking further ahead, in 2011 inflation rates should remain moderate overall, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced. Upside risks over the medium term relate, in particular, to the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. Overall, the Governing Council will monitor closely the future evolution of all available price indicators. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 turned positive and was 0.2% in June 2010, after -0.1% in May. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased slightly further but, at 0.3%, remained weak. Together, these data continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. Shorter-term developments in M3 and some of its components and counterparts have remained volatile, and this volatility may well persist. The previously strong impact of the interest rate constellation on monetary dynamics, while still affecting the pace of underlying money growth, appears to be gradually waning. This implies a gradual reduction in the effect on actual M3 growth arising from the downward impact of the steep yield curve and the associated allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside M3. At the same time, the annual growth rate of M1 has continued to moderate, although it remained strong at 9.2% in June 2010. In part, this reflects somewhat higher opportunity costs of holding overnight deposits relative to other short-term deposits. The still weak annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continues to conceal countervailing developments, with increasingly positive growth in loans to households and stabilised negative annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations. A lagged response of loans to non-financial corporations to developments in economic activity is a normal feature of the business cycle. The data up to June indicate that, after expanding for a few months earlier in the year, the size of banks' overall balance sheets has not increased further. The challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up. Where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In this respect, we welcome the EU-wide stress-testing exercise, which was prepared and conducted by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) and national supervisory authorities, in close cooperation with the ECB. This stress-testing exercise was comprehensive and rigorous, and the results confirm the resilience of EU and euro area banking systems as a whole to severe economic and financial shocks. The stress test has also significantly enhanced transparency regarding the current financial conditions and risk exposures of the 91 institutions that participated in the exercise. Hence, the exercise represents an important step forward in restoring market confidence. We also welcome the commitment made by national authorities with regard to the provision of support facilities for banks where private sector means are insufficient. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models are key to strengthening banks' resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth, job creation and financial stability. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Considering all the new information which has become available since our meeting on 8 July 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. The available economic data and survey-based indicators suggest a strengthening in economic activity in the second quarter of 2010, and the available data for the third quarter are better than expected. Looking further ahead, and taking into account a number of temporary factors, we continue to expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate and still uneven pace, in an environment of uncertainty. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, it is essential that budget plans for 2011 and beyond reflect a strong commitment to returning to sound public finances. Given the exceptional fiscal deterioration over the past two years, there is an urgent need to implement credible medium-term consolidation strategies aimed at restoring fiscal sustainability and creating room for budgetary manoeuvre. As a minimum, countries' budgetary targets must comply with the fiscal consolidation requirements foreseen under the respective excessive deficit procedures. More ambitious targets, as already adopted by a number of euro area countries, may become necessary where current plans fall short of meeting the main objective of halting and reversing the increase in the government debt ratio. Moreover, all countries must specify credible fiscal adjustment measures, focusing on the expenditure side, while being prepared to implement additional measures, where needed, over the coming years. In order to support the process of fiscal consolidation, to underpin the proper functioning of the euro area and to strengthen the prospects for higher sustainable growth, the pursuit of far-reaching structural reforms is essential. Major reforms are particularly needed in those countries that have experienced competitiveness losses in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. Measures should ensure a wage bargaining process that allows wages to adjust flexibly to the unemployment situation and losses in competitiveness. Reforms to strengthen productivity growth would further support the adjustment process of these economies."
United States,2010-08-10,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent months. Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising; however, investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Housing starts remain at a depressed level. Bank lending has continued to contract. Nonetheless, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be more modest in the near term than had been anticipated. Measures of underlying inflation have trended lower in recent quarters and, with substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To help support the economic recovery in a context of price stability, the Committee will keep constant the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities at their current level by reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in longer-term Treasury securities.1 The Committee will continue to roll over the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities as they mature. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A Duke; Donald L Kohn; Sandra Pianalto; Eric S Rosengren; Daniel K Tarullo; and Kevin M Warsh. Voting against the policy was Thomas M Hoenig, who judges that the economy is recovering modestly, as projected. Accordingly, he believed that continuing to express the expectation of exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period was no longer warranted and limits the Committee's ability to adjust policy when needed. In addition, given economic and financial conditions. Mr. Hoenig did not believe that keeping constant the size of the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities at their current level was required to support a return to the Committee's policy objectives. The Open Market Desk will issue a technical note shortly after the statement providing operational details on how it will carry out these transactions."
Chile,2010-08-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 12 August 2010 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points to 2.0 (annual). Internationally, uncertainty about the pace of recovery of world output has increased and financial market volatility has remained high. Commodity prices are still elevated. Overall, the external scenario facing the Chilean economy continues to be favorable. Domestically, available data show significant output and demand dynamism, beyond what was foreseen in the latest Monetary Policy Report. Unemployment has declined. In July, the monthly CPI variation responded mainly to transitory phenomena, and the various measures of core inflation remained well contained. Private expectations consider that in the short term y-o-y inflation will be above the target, but toward the end of the policy horizon they are consistent with levels around 3%. The Board will continue to reduce the current significant monetary policy stimulus at a pace that will depend on the unfolding of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions. Accordingly, the Board reiterates that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2010-08-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.25%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.25%) for the intermeeting period. In the global economy, emerging market economies have sustained their favorable performance, while the economies of major advanced countries have largely continued their recovery trend. The international financial market unrest due to the government debt problems in some European countries has eased. The possibility, however, of the heightened volatility of economic activity in major countries acting as a risk factor cannot be ruled out. The upward trend of domestic business activity has been maintained. Exports have sustained their buoyancy, domestic demand such as consumption and investment has steadily increased and, led by the private sector, labor market conditions have shown an improving trend. The domestic economy is expected to continue on an upward track, even in the presence of external risk. Consumer price inflation has so far remained within a range of somewhat above 2% but a little below 3%, but in the future, upward pressures are expected to build continuously owing to the increase in demand-pull pressures associated with the continued upswing in activity. In the real estate market, housing sales prices have declined in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while those in other areas have sustained an upward trend. In the financial markets, short term market interest rates and banks' lending and borrowing interest rates have increased due to the hike of the Base Rate. Stock prices have risen, with the large scale inflow of foreign portfolio investment funds. Mortgage lending has steadily expanded in response chiefly to low lending rates, even though house transactions have been inactive. Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy in such a way as to help the economy maintain price stability, while sustaining sound growth under the accommodative policy stance. In carrying out policy, it will take overall account of financial and economic conditions at home and abroad."
Peru,2010-08-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2010 BCRP RAISED THE REFERENCE RATE TO 2.5% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy reference rate from 2.0 percent to 2.5 percent This measure is mainly preventive in a context of strong dynamism of domestic demand, a situation that requires to continue withdrawing monetary stimulus in order to maintain inflation within the target range. Current and advanced indicators of activity show a rapid growth of economic activity. In July the production of electricity grew 12.8 percent, imports of capital goods grew 30 percent, imports of inputs grew 35 percent, and imports of non-durable goods grew 31 percent, which reflects the strength of private consumption and private investment. An acceleration of the growth of public spending is being observed at the same time: public spending increased 14 percent in May and 22 percent in June. Inflation in July recorded a rate of 0.36 percent, mainly due to the rise of food prices as a result of supply factors. With this, annual inflation increased to 1.82 percent. Core inflation, which showed a rate of 0.08 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 1.79 percent and remains around the 2 percent target. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to raise the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent. Overnight deposits: 1.70 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for September on its session of September 9, 2010."
Georgia,2010-08-18,"18.08.10 The NBG Keeps its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) unchanged at 6.50 Percent The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on August 18, 2010 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 6.50 percent. The annual inflation rate stood at 7 percent in July. The abovementioned indicator is largely a result of base effect influences. Existing forecasts indicate that the elevated level of inflation in July is a temporary event and it is expected that, during the coming months the annual inflation rate will return to its target level. Foreign currency inflows arising from remittances have increased over the last few months. As was expected, receipts resulting from the export of tourism services increased considerably in July- August. A notable increase in the international price of wheat has been observed as of late, although over the last week, the price of wheat has stopped rising. From the beginning of July onward, the price of sugar on the world markets has also been marked by growth, although during the last couple of days, the price of sugar has stabilized as well. The NBG will closely monitor developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on September 15, 2010."
Turkiye,2010-08-19,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep one-week repo auction rate (the policy rate) and overnight rates unchanged as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 7 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 6.50 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 2.50 percent, lending rate at 12 percent, d) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent. Recent data releases are in line with the outlook presented in the July Inflation Report. There are signs of a partial slowdown in the external demand, while domestic demand displays a relatively stable outlook. Therefore, it would take a while before industrial capacity utilization rates return to their pre-crisis levels. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates remain at high levels. Moreover, risks regarding the global economy remain significant. The Committee has restated that inflation would increase temporarily in the short term before reverting to a declining path starting from the last quarter of the year. Core inflation indicators are expected to remain consistent with the medium-term targets. In light of these developments, the Committee reiterated that it would be necessary to maintain policy rates at current levels for some time, and to keep them at low levels for a long period. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Israel,2010-08-23,"23.8.2010</td> The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for September 2010 unchanged at 1.75 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for September 2010 will remain unchanged at 1.75 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The July CPI rose by 0.5 percent, below the rangeof forecasters' predictions of an increase of between 0.7 percent and 0.9 percent. The housing index rose by 1.1 percent, and since the beginning of the year it has risen by 3.2 percent. Inflation in the last twelve months was 1.8 percent, within the target range for the second consecutive month; adjusting for the effects of changes in indirect taxes and surcharges, inflation was 1.6 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: In the last month inflation expectations derived from the capital market and those of the private forecasters declined, and average inflation expectations for the next twelve months, about 2.8 percent, moved into the target range. The background to the decline in expected inflation included the increase in the Bank of Israelinterest rate for August and the lower than expected July CPI. Inflation measured over the previous twelve months is expected to remain around the midpoint of the target inflation range for the next few months. The expected Bank of Israel interest rate one year forward, calculated from the capitalmarket is 2.6 percent, and the forecasters, on average, expect it to be 2.8 percent. None of the forecasts referred to by the Bank of Israel predicted an increase in the interest rate for September. Real economic activity: National Accounts data published this month indicate that the expansion of economic activity accelerated in the second quarter compared with the rate in the first quarter. GDP grew at annual rate of 4.7 percent in the second quarter, and business sector product by 6 percent. Contributing to this growth were the high rates of increase in exports and private consumption--15.8 percent and 8.7 percentrespectively. Fixed investment showed signs of recovery for the first timesince the outbreak of the crisis. Nonresidential gross fixed capital formation increased by 7.1 percent, and residential investment by 17.1 percent, annual rates. The composite state-of-the-economy index for July rose by 0.2 percent, with significant upward revisions to the indices for the previousthree months due to updated data on exports. Data on government tax revenues also indicate increased economic activity. The Research Department staff forecast is that inflation in the next twelve months will be 2.5 percent, with a gradual increase in the interest rate during that time to about 3 percent. The current macroeconomic forecast of the Research Department of 3.7 percent GDP growth in 2010 is consistent with an expected slowdown in the rate of growth in the third and fourth quarters of the year. The labor market and wages: The most recent labor market data show a continuation of the trend of expansion: the number of employees increased at a steady pace, and in May was 3.5 percent higher than in May 2009; claims for unemployment benefits fell by 2 percent in July relative to June;demand for labor increased--the Central Bureau of Statistics survey for July showed a 3 percent rise relative to June in the number of vacancies; and nominal and real wages remained steady in May. Budget data: From the beginning of 2010 until July the domestic deficit was NIS 9 billion, compared with NIS 15.7 billion in the equivalent period in 2009. On the basis of the current data, the deficit in 2010, excluding credit, is expected to be 4 percent of GDP, or even slightly lower. The foreign exchange market: Since the previous monetary policy discussion held on July 27 until August 20, the shekel appreciated by 1.4 percent against the dollar, and by 2.8 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel strengthened by about 1.7 percent. The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of July 27 and August 20, the Tel Aviv 25 index and the Tel Aviv 100 rose by 4.0 percent and 3.0 percent respectively, in contrast with declinesor no change in most of the leading share price indices around the world. Both nominal and index-linked yields on Israel government medium and long term bonds declined this month , while short-term yields increased as a result of the increase in the Bank of Israel interest rate last month. The yield gap between Israeli and US nominal 10-year government bonds widened slightly this month to about 160 basis points (b.p.), as a result of sharper declines in yields in the US than in Israel. The positive trend in corporate bond issues continued, along with continued investment in mutual funds specializing in corporate bonds. The Tel-Bond 20 index rose by 1 percent over theperiod, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 1.5 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread increased slightly this month to about 122 b.p. The money supply: The M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 3 percent in July (including a substantial seasonal component), following its 1 percent decrease in June; in thelast twelve months it increased by 9.5 percent. The M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased slightly, by 0.2 percent, in July, following its 0.1 percent decline in June; in the last twelve months it increased by 3.3 percent. The credit market: Total outstanding business sector credit increased in June by 1.1% to NIS 743 billion, after remaining unchanged in May. Bank credit accounted for NIS 393 billion, an increase of 1 percent from its May level. Outstanding nonbank credit (corporate bonds and nonbank loans)increased in June by 0.9% to NIS 220 billion. Credit to households grew by 0.7 percent, to NIS 324 billion. The volume of new mortgages was 10 percent lower in July than in June, but is still significantly above the averagelevel in 2009. The rates of interest on fixed- and floating-interest indexed mortgages continued to fall, while interest rates on unindexed floating-rate mortgages remained steady in the last few months. The housing market: The upward trend in house prices, as measuredby the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices (which is not included in the CPI) continued, and in May they increased by 2.2 percent, continuing the increase evident in the last seventeen months. According to the survey, house prices have risen by 21.9 percent in the last twelve months. The global economy: Data from the US. China. France. Italy, the UK. Japan and elsewhere indicate that the probability of a slowdown in the global rate of growth increased significantly this month. Domestic private consumption, which usually constitutes a major engine for growth, did not recover in any of the major economies. In those countries which showed high rates of growth, these derived from temporary factors (fiscal stimuli and rebuilding of inventories) or exports. The general assessment is that one of the major aspects delaying the recovery in private consumption is the lack of employment security, as labor markets have not recovered yet and unemployment rates are still high. Due to the lack of certainty regarding the economic situation, companies are hesitant to invest and hire labor, despite the high profits they reported in the second quarter and the large cash holdings of many of them. Inflation in the major economies does not pose a threat for the foreseeable future, which enables central banks to keep interest rates at low levels, thereby supporting economic activity, so that interest rates are not expected to increase in the near future in the leading economies. The main factors behind the decision The decision to hold the interest rate for September at 1.75 percent is consistent with the gradual process of returning the interest rate to a more 'normal' level, intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to support the further recovery of economic activity, while maintaining financial stability. The pace of interest rate increases is not constant, but is set in accordance with the inflation environment, growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the leading central banks, and developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. At the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. C 5B 8 Inflation in the last twelve months was 1.8 percent, below the midpoint of the target inflation range, despite the rapid rise of 5.6 percent in the housing indexin that period. Inflation expectations calculated from the capital market for one year ahead and those of the private forecasters declined to below the upper limit of the target inflation range. C 5B 8 Most indicators of real economic activity published this month point to continued expansion. Nevertheless, uncertainty persists regarding the rate of growth in Israel. This is due mainly to the high degree of uncertainty prevailing in the global economy, reflected in downward adjustments of growth rate forecasts by analysts and international organizations. C 5B 8 Interest rates of the central banks of the major advanced economies are at very low levels, and in light of recent weak data are expected to remain so for an extended period. Nevertheless central banks in several countries that are already growing relatively rapidly continued with the process of increasing their interest rates last month too, and are expected to continue to do so in the near future. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic and financial developments, and will use the instruments available to itto achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the housing market, and especially on house prices. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on September 6, 2010. The decision regarding the interest rate for October 2010 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. September 27, 2010. 23.8.2010</td> The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for September 2010 unchanged at 1.75 percent.

Poland,2010-08-24,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 24 August 2010 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 23-24 August 2010 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) discount rate 4.00% on an annual basis. Released data, including the data on GDP for 2010 Q2, point to weakening economic growth in some of the largest economies, in particular in the United States. By contrast, in 2010 Q2 the economic growth accelerated significantly in Germany and to a lesser extent in the euro area as a whole. However, the risk of weakened external demand sustains the uncertainty as to the euro area economic growth in subsequent quarters. The adjustments in the balance sheets of households, enterprises and financial institutions continue in the developed economies. In the recent period the price of some agricultural commodities have increased markedly in the global markets. At the same time, the observed alleviation of tensions in the financial markets have favoured the inflow of capital to emerging economies and the appreciation of those countries' currencies, including the strengthening of the zloty. The data on the Polish economy indicate a stabilisation of economic growth. Fast growth in industrial output and a slow growth in construction continued. Growing employment in the enterprise sector and a decline in the unemployment rate (also in seasonally adjusted terms) both point to a gradual improvement in the labour market situation, which, however, has not been accompanied by growing wage pressure so far. In 2010 Q2 growth of wages in the economy continued to fall gradually despite some acceleration in enterprise sector wages. Lending to enterprises remains limited, mainly due to reasons related to the demand for credit. In July 2010 the annual CPI inflation decreased (to 2.0%), running below the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. The decline in the annual CPI inflation mainly resulted from negative base effects connected with a strong rise in the prices of fuels and excise goods one year before. At the same time, all measures of core inflation decreased. In subsequent months, inflation may be gradually increased by food and energy price growth. In the first months of 2011 the level of prices may be raised by the announced change of VAT rates. The impact of this change on inflation should nevertheless be minor. The Council has discussed factors that may fuel inflationary pressures in the medium term. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. An important factor affecting monetary policy is the situation of public finance, especially in the face of a changed attitude in many European countries to high budget deficits and growing public debts. Introducing decisive measures aimed at permanently reducing the deficit of the general government sector and at curbing the increase of the public debt is necessary for macroeconomic stability and will allow the meeting of euro adoption criteria. In the opinion of the Council, introducing measures aimed at preventing fast growth in foreign currency lending to households is important for macroeconomic stability. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the ERM II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organisational conditions. The Council approved The Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland in 2010 Q1."
Philippines,2010-08-25,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. The policy rates have been steady since July 2009. The Monetary Board's decision was based on its assessment that monetary policy settings remain appropriate, given the favorable inflation profile shown by current inflation trends, the inflation outlook, and the public's expectations about inflation. Latest forecasts indicate inflation averaging within the target ranges of 4.5 ± 1 percent for 2010 and 4 ± 1 percent for 2011 and 2012. The forecasts are also supported by well-contained inflation expectations which continue to be within-target over the policy horizon. The Monetary Board noted the higher-than-expected real GDP growth of 7.9 percent for second quarter 2010 and the revised first quarter 2010 real GDP of 7.8 percent. The Board observed that the recent strengthening of capital formation could have added to the economy's productive capacity, thus moderating additional price pressures. On this basis, the Monetary Board noted that favorable inflation dynamics provide the flexibility to keep policy interest rates steady. The BSP's efforts to promote low and stable inflation are therefore consistent with the maintenance of supportive conditions for domestic economic growth amidst lingering uncertainties surrounding global economic growth prospects. The Monetary Board, however, noted that there are upside risks to the inflation outlook. These include continued stronger-than-expected expansion in domestic demand and petitions for electricity rate adjustments. Meanwhile, a downside risk to inflation involves the prospect of a slower-than-expected growth in the global economy. Looking ahead, the Board will continue to carefully assess these risks to ensure that monetary policy settings remain well calibrated."
Thailand,2010-08-25,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 25 August 2010 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Assistant Governor. Bank of Thailand, announces the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, as follows. The global economy continued to recover during the first half of the year, even though the pace of growth for the rest of the year for the US and Japan is expected to decelerate. The European economies have improved, but fragility remains from sovereign debt problem in some economies. Meanwhile Asian economies continue to grow robustly. The Thai economy expanded faster than expected in the second quarter, despite decelerating somewhat from the first quarter due to domestic political situation. Private consumption continues to grow favourably, while the tourism industry has shown clearer signs of a speedy recovery. Manufacturing production and capacity utilization have risen, which should lend support to private investment in the periods ahead. Exports have been growing in tandem with global economic recovery, although the pace of growth is expected to slow down in the second half of the year. Inflationary pressure remains low at present, but is expected to rise in 2011 in line with economic expansion and rising costs of production. There is a small possibility that core inflation could rise above the upper band of the target range. The MPC therefore decided to raise the policy interest rate by 025 per cent per annum, from 150 to 175 per cent per annum, effective immediately."
Euroarea,2010-09-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council continues to view the current key ECB interest rates as appropriate. Considering all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 5 August 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. Recent economic data for the euro area have been stronger than expected, partly owing to temporary factors. Looking ahead, the recovery should proceed at a moderate pace, with uncertainty still prevailing. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. The Governing Council has today also decided to continue to conduct its main refinancing operations (MROs) and its special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of this year's twelfth maintenance period on 18 January 2011. The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at the time. Furthermore, it has decided to conduct the 3-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs), to be carried out in October. November and December 2010, as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these 3-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. The Governing Council has also decided to carry out three additional fine-tuning operations on 30 September, 11 November and 23 December when 6-month and 12-month refinancing operations mature. Overall, the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. Monetary policy will do all that is needed to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium term. This is the necessary and central contribution that monetary policy makes to fostering sustainable economic growth, job creation and financial stability. All the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions, referred to as “enhanced credit support” and the Securities Markets Programme, are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. We remain firmly committed to maintaining price stability over the medium to longer term. The monetary policy stance, the overall provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. After a period of sharp decline, euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009. Euro area real GDP grew strongly on a quarterly basis, increasing by 1.0% in the second quarter of 2010, supported by ongoing growth at the global level but also in part reflecting temporary domestic factors. Recent data and survey evidence generally confirm the expectation of a moderation in the second half of this year, both at the global level and in the euro area. Nevertheless, while uncertainty still prevails, they continue to indicate a positive underlying momentum of the recovery in the euro area. Ongoing growth at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports, together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system, should continue to support the euro area economy. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and labour market prospects. This assessment is also reflected in the September 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, according to which annual real GDP growth will range between 1.4% and 1.8% in 2010 and between 0.5% and 2.3% in 2011. Compared with the June 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the range for real GDP growth this year has been revised upwards, owing to the stronger than expected rebound in economic growth in the second quarter as well as better than expected developments over the summer months. For 2011 the range has also been revised upwards, reflecting mainly carry-over effects from the projected stronger growth towards the end of 2010. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to this improved economic outlook are slightly tilted to the downside, with uncertainty still prevailing. On the one hand, global trade may continue to perform more strongly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. On the other hand, concerns remain relating to the emergence of renewed tensions in financial markets and to some uncertainty about growth prospects in other advanced economies and at the global level. In addition, downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.6% in August, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, compared with 1.7% in July. The small decline in inflation is likely to reflect base effects in the energy component. Later in the year annual HICP inflation rates are expected to increase slightly while displaying some volatility. Looking further ahead, in 2011 inflation rates should remain moderate overall, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This assessment is also reflected in the September 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 1.5% and 1.7% for 2010 and between 1.2% and 2.2% for 2011. Compared with the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections of June 2010, the ranges have been revised slightly upwards, largely on account of higher commodity prices. Risks to the outlook for price developments are slightly tilted to the upside. They relate, in particular, to the evolution of energy and non-oil commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 stood at 0.2% in July 2010, unchanged from June. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, which has been gradually increasing, rose further to 0.9%, but still remains relatively weak. The subdued developments in money and loan growth continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. The downward impact of the steep yield curve on monetary growth, which is reflected in the allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside M3, is gradually waning. Moreover, the impact of the narrow spreads between different short-term interest rates on the growth of the components of M3 is continuing to diminish. As a result, the annual growth rate of M1 has continued to moderate from high levels, and stood at 8.1% in July 2010, while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits has become less negative. The still weak annual growth rate of bank loans to the non-financial private sector continues to conceal positive growth in loans to households and diminishing negative annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations. These developments are consistent with a normal, lagged response of loan developments to economic activity over the business cycle. Given the subdued developments in banks' overall balance sheets, the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up. Where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Considering all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 5 August 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. Recent economic data for the euro area have been stronger than expected, partly owing to temporary factors. Looking ahead, the recovery should proceed at a moderate pace, with uncertainty still prevailing. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, current developments at the euro area aggregate level appear to be broadly in line with previous expectations. At the country level, any positive fiscal developments that may emerge, reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected macroeconomic environment, should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation. At the same time, in countries where there is still a need to take additional specific measures to achieve consolidation targets, such measures should be adopted swiftly to ensure that consolidation commitments are fulfilled. This is a prerequisite for maintaining confidence in the credibility of governments' fiscal targets. Positive effects on confidence can compensate for the reduction in demand stemming from fiscal consolidation, when fiscal adjustment strategies are perceived as credible, ambitious and focused on the expenditure side. The conditions for such positive effects are particularly favourable in the current environment of macroeconomic uncertainty. In order to support the process of fiscal consolidation, to underpin the proper functioning of the euro area and to strengthen the prospects for higher sustainable growth, the pursuit of far-reaching structural reforms is essential. Major reforms are particularly needed in those countries that have experienced competitiveness losses in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. Measures should ensure a wage bargaining process that allows wages to adjust flexibly and appropriately to the unemployment situation and losses in competitiveness. Reforms to strengthen productivity growth would further support the adjustment process of these economies."
Malaysia,2010-09-02,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 2.75 percent. The global growth momentum has moderated in recent months. In the advanced economies, growth has slowed by more than expected following continued weakness in the labour market and the fading impact of the temporary boost to economic activity provided by the inventory build up and the policy stimulus. For the regional economies, after registering strong economic expansion in the first half of the year, the slower pace of export growth will have some impact on economic performance. Domestic economic activity, however, remains strong. Given these developments, the assessment going forward is for the global recovery to proceed at a more moderate pace. The Malaysian economy expanded strongly in the first half of this year, underpinned by strengthening domestic demand, particularly in the private sector. As in other regional countries. Malaysia's export growth has, however, slowed in recent months. These conditions are expected to continue with the slowing of global growth. While these external developments may result in a moderation in the pace of growth of the Malaysian economy, moving forward, the overall growth will continue to be supported by the robust domestic economic activity. Leading indicators suggest that private consumption and private investment will continue to expand. This is also supported by the favourable labour market conditions, positive consumer and business sentiments, low inflation and conducive credit conditions. Domestic inflation edged higher in June and July mainly on account of increases in food and energy prices. Despite the adjustment in retail fuel prices in July, inflation is expected to rise at a modest pace in the coming months. Going into 2011, inflation is projected to continue to remain moderate. The MPC considers the current monetary policy as appropriate and consistent with the latest assessment of the economic growth and inflation prospects. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy continues to remain accommodative and supportive of economic growth. Bank Negara Malaysia 02 September 2010."
South Korea,2010-09-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.25%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.25%) for the intermeeting period. In the global economy, emerging market economies have sustained their favorable performance, and the economies of major advanced countries have largely continued their recovery trend, even though the US economy has shown signs of a slowdown. Looking ahead, there exists the possibility of the heightened volatility of economic activity in major countries acting as a risk factor for the global economy. The upward trend of domestic business activity has been maintained. Exports have sustained their buoyancy and consumption has steadily increased and, led by the private sector, labor market conditions have shown an improving trend. The domestic economy is expected to continue on an upward track, even in the presence of external risk. Consumer price inflation has so far stayed within a range of somewhat above 2% but a little below 3%, but in the future, upward pressures are expected to build continuously owing to the increase in demand-pull pressures associated with the continued upswing in activity. In the real estate market, housing sales prices have declined in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while those in other areas have continued to increase. In the financial markets, short term market interest rates and banks' lending and borrowing interest rates have continued to rise. Long term market interest rates, however, have declined in response chiefly to the inflow of foreign portfolio investment funds. The scale of the growth in mortgage lending has decreased somewhat, with transactions remaining inactive. Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy in such a way as to help the economy maintain price stability, while sustaining sound growth under the accommodative policy stance. In carrying out policy, it will take overall account of financial and economic conditions at home and abroad."
South Africa,2010-09-09,"The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas declined to 3,7 per cent in July 2010, compared with 4,6 per cent in May. Goods price inflation measured 2,1 per cent in July, while services inflation, which had been relatively sticky, declined to below the upper level of the target range and measured 5,4 per cent. The categories of housing and utilities (mainly electricity) and miscellaneous goods and services (predominantly insurance costs) together contributed 2,2 percentage points of the 3,7 per cent inflation outcome. However, electricity price increases were lower than expected. There was also a quick reversal of the influence of the Fifa World Cup on some categories. This was particularly noticeable in the category of hotels which experienced a month-on-month price decline of 11,2 per cent. CPI excluding administered prices measured 2,9 per cent ie below the lower limit of the inflation target band. The recent upward trend in producer price inflation was reversed in July when it measured 7,7 per cent, having peaked at 9,4 per cent in June. Food price inflation remained benign, with agricultural prices increasing by 0,2 per cent on a year-on-year basis, while manufactured food prices declined by 1,0 per cent over the same period. This suggests that food prices at the consumer level are likely to remain contained for some time, notwithstanding higher global food prices. Partly as a result of the recent lower-than-expected inflation outcomes, the inflation forecast of the Bank was revised downwards, particularly in the short to medium term. Targeted CPI inflation is expected to reach a low point of 3,7 per cent on average in the third quarter of 2010. Inflation is expected to average 4,8 per cent in 2011 and to measure 5,1 per cent in the final quarter of 2012. The lower inflation trend has had a favourable impact on inflation expectations in the financial markets. Break-even inflation rates, as measured by the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation-linked bonds, declined across all maturities since the previous meeting of the MPC and remain below the 6 per cent level. The Reuters survey of analysts published in September also shows an improvement of expectations and inflation is expected to average 4,6 per cent and 5,2 per cent in 2010 and 2011 respectively. The global economic outlook continues to be characterised by heightened uncertainty. Although fears of a reversion to recession in the advanced economies have diminished somewhat, the downside risks remain high. During the course of the year, forecasts of global growth have generally been downgraded in the wake of the European sovereign debt crisis, high rates of unemployment in the US and the euro area, and weak demand in many of the advanced economies. The US economy is expected to experience below-trend growth for some time, and doubts remain about the sustainability of the fiscal austerity programmes in some of the southern European economies. A number of Latin American and Asian economies, apart from Japan, have maintained their strong growth performances, but China has experienced a moderate policy-induced slowdown. While the low-growth global outlook poses a downside risk to prospects for domestic economic growth, inflationary pressures emanating from the advanced economies are likely to remain benign. The hesitant global recovery has also helped to maintain international oil prices in a relatively stable range of between US$70-US$80 for some time. These international developments also imply that policy rates are likely to remain abnormally low for an extended period of time in a number of the advanced economies. The resultant search for yield by foreign fund managers has had implications for the rand exchange rate, which remains the main downside risk to the inflation outlook. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has appreciated by about 4,6 per cent against the US dollar and by 5,6 per cent against the euro. On a trade weighted basis, the rand has appreciated by 4,0 per cent since the July meeting and by 5,7 per cent since January 2010. Since the beginning of the year, non-residents have been net buyers of equities and bonds to the value of R100 billion, of which R75 billion were bond purchases. This compares with net purchases of bonds totaling R15,5 billion in 2009 as a whole. Whereas in previous years bond flows appeared to be mainly speculative in nature, the recent developments suggest that there could have been a fundamental shift in these flows. There are indications that a significant proportion of these flows are more long term in nature as foreign pension funds and other fund managers take advantage of higher yields in emerging market economies. The higher levels of bond market inflows are not unique to South Africa. It is estimated that emerging-market bond funds have recorded year-to-date inflows of US$32 billion, compared with the previous full-year high of US$9,7 billion in 2005. The appreciating trend of the rand exchange rate has been sustained despite further accumulation of foreign exchange reserves by the Reserve Bank. The Bank does not target a level for the exchange rate, but takes advantage of prevailing conditions to continue to build reserves. However, this is a costly exercise, and in order to sterilise the impact on the money market, the Bank is now engaged in longer-term foreign exchange swap transactions. This in effect results in an overbought foreign exchange position, and adds to the international liquidity position, but not to the gross reserves. Gross reserves will only be affected if and when these swaps are not rolled over and the Bank takes delivery of the dollars. Any profits or losses will be borne by the National Treasury in keeping with its stated commitment to support the Bank in its reserves accumulation efforts. Domestic economic growth declined in the second quarter of 2010, to a quarter-on-quarter annualised rate of 3,2 per cent, following a growth rate of 4,6 per cent in the previous quarter. The slower growth was due mainly to the 20,8 per cent contraction in the mining sector in this quarter. Growth in the manufacturing sector moderated to 6,9 per cent from 8,4 per cent in the first quarter, while the tertiary sector grew at a rate of 4,0 per cent. Growth in the second half of 2010 is expected to moderate further. The composite leading business cycle indicator of the Bank declined in May and June, suggesting a slowdown in the pace of recovery in the coming months. Although the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index rebounded markedly in the third quarter following the second quarter decline, the overall index remains below the 50 level, and confidence has remained particularly weak in the manufacturing and construction sectors. The Kagiso/BER purchasing managers index increased slightly in August, but it nevertheless points to a deceleration of the growth momentum in the sector. At the same time, manufacturing capacity utilisation, which increased moderately in the second quarter, remains below the long term average. The construction sector also continues to be under pressure, as evidenced in the low growth in building plans passed, while private sector gross fixed capital formation is expected to remain subdued. The Bank's forecast of GDP growth has declined moderately since the previous meeting of the MPC, with growth now expected to average 2,8 per cent in 2010 and 3,2 per cent in 2011. Household consumption expenditure has shown some signs of recovery following the contraction during 2009. Growth in real final consumption expenditure by households moderated to an annualised rate of 4,8 per cent in the second quarter of 2010 compared with growth of 5,7 per cent in the first quarter. The impact of the World Cup on expenditure is unclear at this stage, but some moderation can be expected in coming months. Motor vehicle sales have shown a particularly strong year-on-year recovery, although off a low base. Preemptive buying ahead of the introduction of the carbon emissions tax may have contributed to this outcome. The outlook for household consumption expenditure continues to be affected by contradictory forces. The main negative factors include low levels of credit extension, high levels of household indebtedness, high levels of unemployment and continued job losses. Underlying credit extension remains weak but there has been some improvement in the past months. Growth over twelve months in banks' total loans and advances to the private sector measured 1,7 per cent in July, its highest level in over a year. Growth in mortgage advances, which measured 4,0 per cent, was the main driver of this growth. Instalment sale and leasing finance, as well as other loans and advances, continued to contract but at a slower rate. Within the latter category, general loans exhibited positive year-on-year growth of 2,1 per cent. Growth in the retail portfolios of banks remained weak, and the ratio of impaired advances to gross loans and advances amounted to 5,9 per cent in June, relatively unchanged from the previous quarter. Although banks appear to have relaxed their credit criteria somewhat, they remain relatively cautious, and their pricing for risk still appears to be higher than was the case before the crisis. Consumers are also constrained by high levels of debt, although the cost of servicing the debt has declined in line with lower interest rates. Household debt as a ratio to disposable income has moderated very slowly from its peak of over 80 per cent. Household consumption expenditure is also expected to be constrained by the continued unemployment trends. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey of Statistics South Africa, the unemployment rate increased marginally in the second quarter of 2010 to 25,3 per cent. In the two years to the second quarter of 2010, one million jobs were lost, while the number of discouraged workers increased by 900,000. Consistent with the slowdown in manufacturing and construction, job shedding was most marked in these sectors. Factors that could provide a positive impetus to household consumption expenditure include lower nominal interest rates, lower inflation, positive wealth effects arising from improving house prices and equity market developments, and high levels of real wage increases for those in employment. Wealth effects over the past year have been positive, with house prices increasing at year-on-year rates of over 10 per cent. However in July the rate of increase declined moderately according to both the ABSA and FNB house price indices. The bond market rally has continued, and equity prices have recovered significantly from their lows in the first quarter of 2009, although they remain below pre-crisis levels. Wage settlements in excess of inflation, while providing a positive impetus to consumption, are also the main upside risk to the inflation outlook. Some wage demands and a number of settlements have been made without regard to the lower inflation outcomes and the improved inflation outlook. Unless accompanied by higher productivity, such settlements could put pressure on domestic prices and impact negatively on our international competitiveness. Such settlements are also likely to have a negative impact on employment trends. Risks from cost push pressures are relatively unchanged. Administered price increases remain on average at elevated levels, and therefore place upside pressures on the inflation outlook. Potential risks emanate from food price increases at the global level, particularly related to wheat prices. However the impact domestically is expected to be constrained by the relatively strong exchange rate and the recent domestic bumper maize crop. The assessment of the Monetary Policy Committee is that the improved inflation outlook creates sufficient room for monetary policy to provide additional stimulus to the somewhat fragile recovery of the domestic economy which remains vulnerable to the uncertain global environment. The MPC has decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 6,0 per cent per annum with effect from 10 September 2010. The MPC views this action to be consistent with the continued attainment of the inflation target, having given due regard to the risks to the outlook. The scope for further downward movement is seen to be limited, but this will be assessed on an ongoing basis. Our approach remains forward-looking and is informed by close examination of the data and future developments."
Georgia,2010-09-15,"15.09.10 The NBG Raises its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) to 7 Percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on September 15, 2010 and decided to increase its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) by 50 basis points to 7 percent. Annual inflation reached 9.5 percent in August. The increase in inflation was largely caused by a rise in the prices of agricultural products. Core inflation rose in August as well. Since the last Committee's meeting, current-year economic estimates indicate higher growth for the economy - six percent. The expedited pace of growth of the economy is mainly a result of fiscal stimulus, which was supported by increased lending of the commercial banks. Lending to individuals has expanded notably, which represents a significant source for the formation of aggregate demand. The avid growth in consumer loans granted to individuals, increases inflation pressures through increased demand. Prices at Global commodity markets have increased recently. Over the last month, the international price of wheat increased by 4.3%, and the price of sugar rose by 13.5%. Inflation also picked up in August in all of Georgia's neighboring countries. High inflation is caused by exogenous factors, for which monetary policy has limited influence. Although dynamics of core inflation indicates an increase of inflation expectations, therefore tightening of monetary policy is needed. The NBG will closely monitor developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on October 27, 2010."
Peru,2010-09-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2010 BCRP RAISES REFERENCE INTEREST RATE TO 3.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy reference rate from 2.5 percent to 3.0 percent. This measure is mainly preventive in a context of strong dynamism of domestic demand, a situation in which withdrawing monetary stimulus is advisable in order to maintain inflation within the target range. However, future adjustments in the reference rate will depend on new information on the evolution of inflation and its determinants. Current and advanced indicators of activity continue showing a rapid growth of economic activity. In August the production of electricity grew 9.0 percent and the demand for cement is estimated to have grown 15 percent. Inflation in August recorded a rate of 0.27 percent, mainly as a result of the rise observed in food prices due to supply factors. With this, annual inflation increased to 2.3 percent. Core inflation, which showed a rate of 0.24 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 1.9 percent and remains around the 2 percent target. Moreover, inflation without considering food and energy increased from 1.11 percent in July to 1.15 percent. Inflation expectations remained anchored within the tolerance range. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to raise the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 3.80 percent. Overnight deposits: 2.20 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for October on its session of October 7, 2010."
Chile,2010-09-16,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 16 September 2010 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points to 2.50% (annual). Internationally, financial market volatility persists and the pace of world economic recovery remains uncertain. Commodity prices are still ellevated. Domestically, output and demand information has not changed since the closing of September's Monetary Policy Report. In August, the CPI changed somewhat less than expected by the market, while the various measures of core inflation remain well contained. Private expectations consider that y-o-y inflation will stand around 3% toward the end of the policy horizon. The peso has appreciated. The Board will continue to reduce the current significant monetary policy stimulus at a pace that will depend on the unfolding of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions. Accordingly, the Board reiterates that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2010-09-16,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release September 16, 2010 In its meeting held on September 16, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 825 percent and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 85 percen. Headline CPI accelerated by 285 percent in August following the 251 percent in July, pushing the annual rate to 1093 percent in Augus. While these monthly rates are exceptionally high, they have been mainly driven by higher prices of a number of food items, which had witnessed seasonal increases of varying degrees in July and August ahead of and during the month of Ramada. The Ramadan effect exacerbated the impact of supply shortages in red meat and poultry witnessed since early 2010, which caused a surge in their prices during the past two month. The surge in the prices of red meat and poultry in addition to the acceleration in the prices of fruits and vegetables collectively explain on average more than sixty percent of annual headline inflation in both July and Augus. On the other hand, core CPI accelerated by 282 percent in August leading to a jump in the annual rate to 816 percent with more than fifty percent driven by the prices of red meat and poultr. Meanwhile annual real GDP growth recorded 59 percent in 2009/10 Q4 compared to the four year low of 41 percent witnessed in 2008/09 Q2, reflecting a steady improvement in economic activit. Looking ahead, unfolding global economic developments have created uncertainty about the nascent global recovery, which could potentially weigh on domestic investment and external deman. Against the above and despite the sharp increase in food prices, non-food inflation has remained largely subdued since early 2009, implying that underlying inflation pressures arising from the ongoing economic recovery remain containe. Nonetheless the MPC is mindful of the risk of possible propagation of shocks related to food items to other price. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Division Chief.

India,2010-09-16,"Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: September 2010 Monetary Measures On the basis of the Reserve Bank's assessment of macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: increase the repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 5.75 per cent to 6.0 per cent with immediate effect. increase the reverse repo rate under the LAF by 50 basis points from 4.5 per cent to 5.0 per cent with immediate effect. The Global Scenario The Reserve Bank's First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy on July 27, 2010 expressed concerns over the global outlook. Indicators of economic activity in advanced economies continue to suggest that the recovery is slowing and that the second half of 2010 will post slower growth than the first, although expectations have generally not been revised downwards since end-July. Belying earlier apprehensions. Europe has demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of the sovereign debt pressures that severely threatened the recovery a few months ago. The European Central Bank has revised its forecast for second-half growth upwards. China, after showing some signs of slowdown in the second quarter of 2010, appears to have bounced back, with industrial production and trade numbers reviving sharply. Overall, even as the global environment continues to be a cause for caution, the big picture has not worsened significantly since July. The Domestic Scenario Growth in Q1 of 2010-11 was estimated at 8.8 per cent. Although some of this is attributable to a favourable base effect, the growth rate indicates that the recovery is consolidating and the economy is rapidly converging to its trend rate of growth. The index of industrial production (IIP) showed some slippage in the last month of the quarter (June 2010) with the revised numbers showing growth to be a relatively sluggish 5.8 per cent. The trend was sharply reversed in July, with growth surging to 13.8 per cent, led by capital goods, which grew by 63 per cent. Although the year-on-year growth rate for the first four months of the year remains robust at 11.4 per cent, the high volatility over the past two months raises some doubts about how effectively the index reflects the underlying momentum in the industrial sector. Growth prospects in agriculture have clearly been boosted by the monsoon, which, by virtue of substantial replenishment of reservoirs and ground water, will also2 contribute to a good rabi harvest. Virtually all leading indicators of service sector activity point to sustained growth. Inflation remains the dominant concern in macroeconomic management. The published wholesale price index (WPI) inflation rate for August 2010 was based on the new series (base year: 2004-05=100) for the first time. The new series has better coverage of items and the manufacturing products group has a slightly higher weight. Both the old and the new series, however, indicate similar broad trend of inflation. For instance, average monthly WPI inflation for Q1 of 2010-11, based on either series, is in double digits. However, the monthly average of WPI inflation for Q1 of 2010-11 under the new series at 10.6 per cent was about 50 basis points lower than the rate of 11.1 per cent under the old series. In July 2010, there was a slight moderation in the provisional WPI inflation under both the series. There has been further moderation in the provisional WPI inflation to 8.5 per cent in August from 9.8 per cent in July 2010 as per the new series. The direction of the inflation rate movement is consistent with the Reserve Bank's projection made in the July review, though the magnitude could be slightly different. Inferences from both the series are similar. Essentially, inflation rates have reached a plateau, but are likely to remain at unacceptably high levels for some months. While prices of food articles, which according to the new series, rose by over 14 per cent in August, are still contributing to the pressure, about two-thirds of the August inflation can be attributed to items other than food articles and products. Notwithstanding slight moderation in August 2010, the headline inflation remains significantly above the trend of 5.05.5 per cent in the 2000s. There is, therefore, need for continued policy response to contain inflation and anchor inflationary expectation. Another aspect of the concern with inflation is its implications for real interest rates. The policy actions taken over the past three quarters have been partly motivated by the need to end the prevalence of negative real interest rates. This was sought to be accomplished by a combination of increasing policy rates in a non- disruptive manner and declining inflation rates. Both factors are at work, but the process is still incomplete. One important consequence of negative real rates is that banks have seen a deceleration of deposit growth, as savers look for higher returns elsewhere. If bank credit is not to become a constraint to growth, real rates need to move in the direction of encouraging bank deposits. With reference to government finances, the fiscal deficit appears to be conforming to the estimates made in the Union Budget for 2010-11. Higher than expected realisations on 3G and broadband wireless access (BWA) auctions combined with buoyant tax revenues have virtually eliminated the risk of the fiscal deficit overshooting the targeted 5.5 per cent, even after the supplementary demand for grants is taken into account. This will help stabilise market expectations of liquidity and interest rate movements. Liquidity has been a significant factor in monetary policy considerations in recent months. The lead-up to the July policy review saw the liquidity situation transit from a large surplus to a mainly deficit one, making the repo rate the operative policy rate. Consequent on this transition, the transmission from policy rates to market rates has strengthened, with 40 banks raising their deposit rates and 26 raising their lending rates. These circumstances are expected to prevail, maintaining the repo3 rate as the effective policy rate and sustaining the strength of the transmission mechanism. On the external front, the continuing sluggishness of the global economy constrains export growth while the strong domestic recovery has increased demand for imports. As a result, the trade deficit, and with it the current account deficit, are widening. In its July policy review, the Reserve Bank had highlighted the risks associated with a widening current account deficit in the face of increasingly volatile capital inflows. The apparent stabilisation in advanced economies visible over the past few weeks appears to have improved global investor sentiment, resulting in a steady increase in capital inflows into EMEs, including India. If this trend continues, the risks on the external front will clearly abate despite exports remaining sluggish. Overall, our assessment is that growth remains steady, though the recent volatility in industrial production raises some concerns. Inflation also appears to have stopped accelerating though the rate may remain high for some months. The early signs of a downturn in non-food manufacturing inflation suggest that recent monetary actions are having an impact on both inflationary expectations and demand in a non-disruptive way. Should the global situation stabilise, it will help contain volatility in capital flows. But the flip side of that will be possible firming of commodity prices and consequent inflationary pressures. Expected Outcome The measures undertaken in this review should: contain inflation and anchor inflationary expectations without disrupting growth. reduce the volatility in overnight call money rates, thereby strengthening the monetary transmission mechanism. continue the process of normalisation of the monetary policy instruments. The Reserve Bank's rate and liquidity actions since October 2009 have been driven by two considerations: normalisation of the monetary policy stance as the crisis abated and inflation management. The Reserve Bank believes that the tightening that has been carried out over this period has taken the monetary situation close to normal. Consequently, the role of normalisation as a motivation for further actions is likely to be less important. Current and expected macroeconomic conditions will be the more important considerations going forward. The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor these conditions, particularly the price situation, and take further action as warranted.

Turkiye,2010-09-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) was kept constant at 7 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate was reduced from 6.50 percent to 6.25 percent, while lending rate was reduced from 9 percent to 8.75 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate was reduced from 2.50 to 2.25 percent, while lending rate was reduced from 12 to 11.75 percent, d) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions was reduced from 8 percent to 7.75 percent. Recent data releases are in line with the outlook presented in the July Inflation Report. Economic activity is on a milder recovery path following a strong growth in the second quarter. Uncertainties regarding external demand persist, while domestic demand displays a relatively stable outlook. Therefore, it would take a while before industrial capacity utilization rates return to their pre-crisis levels. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates remain at high levels. The Committee has restated that inflation would increase temporarily in the short term before reverting to a declining path starting from the last quarter of the year. Core inflation indicators are expected to remain consistent with the medium-term targets. In light of these developments, the Committee has reiterated that it would be necessary to maintain policy rates at current levels for some time, and to keep them at low levels for a long period. On the other hand, the Committee has assessed that current liquidity conditions are appropriate to implement the second step of the technical rate adjustment mentioned in the “Monetary Policy Exit Strategy” published on April 14, 2010 and decided to change the interest rates as indicated above. Moreover, the Committee has indicated that it would be appropriate to proceed with the measures outlined in the exit strategy that were envisaged to be implemented by the end of 2010. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."

On the global scene, the Committee noted that there had been a marked softening of the global economic recovery, with developments in the US and China giving cause for concern. While the US economy declined in the third quarter, reflecting the renewed deterioration in the housing market and the lackluster labor market performance with private sector job creation still weak. China's massive official stimulus packages, estimated at 14 per cent of GDP and focused on infrastructure and housing, did not only boost aggregate demand but also fed into a property bubble which the government is battling to contain. Opening 1) The meeting commenced at 1007 a. m. with a general prayer at the instance of the Chairman. As a result, growth in China, which overtook that of Japan in the second quarter of 2010 to making the former, the world's second-largest economy, is now declining. Minutes of the Previous Meeting 2) With no observations for corrections, the minutes of the 215th meeting, held on Monday 5th July, 2010, were adopted with motions by Sam O Olofin and Adedoyin Salami. The Committee, therefore, commended the Secretariat for the error-free Minutes. In the Euro Zone, a degree of calmness had returned to the debt market following the approval of a €750 billion (US$925 billon) European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). However, fresh concerns have emerged regarding the high risk aversion in the market, as reflected in the widening of spreads between German bonds and those of weaker peripheral countries, such as Greece. Ireland and Portugal. In addition, many of the region's banks remained fragile and vulnerable to funding constraints due to their dependence on the 1 wholesale markets. However Greece whose fiscal problems ignited the Euro- zone crisis continues to make better than expected progress in fiscal reforms. Matters Arising from the Minutes of the Last Meeting 3. None was raised. Notwithstanding the recent weakening of growth globally, the possibility of a double-dip recession is not very likely. The softening of growth could be seen as a natural adjustment from a period of unsustainably rapid stimulus-driven activity from mid-2009, to a slowing phase of consolidation. .) Presentations by the Departments: Real Sector. Monetary Developments. Financial Markets. Global Developments and Outlook The highlights of the Economic Report were: Projections by the National Bureau of Statistics indicated that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would grow by 772 per cent in the third quarter of 2010 compared with 769 per cent and 723 per cent in the second and first quarters of 2010, respectively. GDP was projected to grow by 819 per cent in the fourth quarter of the year which would be driven by the agriculture, wholesale/retail trade and services sectors 2 with relative contributions of 309, 238 and 238 per cent, respectively. The oil sector was projected to positively contribute 062 percentage point in the third quarter and 063 percentage point in the fourth quarter of 2010 as against the contributions of 012 and 014 per cent in the third and fourth quarters of 2009. On the domestic front, the MPC noted the relative stability achieved in the financial markets, while urging greater efforts in accelerating reforms in the other sectors of the economy, to attain self-sustaining growth. The MPC welcomed the continuing rebound in commodity prices which is helping to support growth in commodity producing regions, including Nigeria, but reiterated the need to diversify the economy to protect the country from the vagaries of oil price volatility. The Committee believes that the inflation risk of the rebound in energy prices appears mitigated by the continuing weak private demand, good harvest, and well-anchored inflation expectations. i The year-on-year headline inflation increased marginally to 137 per cent in August 2010 from 130 per cent in July 2010, compared with 141 per cent in June and 129 per cent in May 2010. The higher inflation rate was attributed to the enlarged and rebased index of consumer prices. Key Domestic Macroeconomic and Financial Developments Output and Prices: The Committee observed that the impressive output growth recorded in 2009 continued in 2010. Provisional data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicates that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 769 per cent in the second quarter of 2010 up from 736 per cent recorded in the first quarter. GDP has been projected to grow by 772 and 819 per cent in the third and fourth quarters of 2010, respectively. Overall GDP growth for 2010 is projected at 778 2 per cent which is higher than the 696 per cent recorded in 2009. The non-oil sector is expected to remain the main driver of overall growth, with agriculture, wholesale and retail trade, and services contributing 240, 204 and 208 per cent, respectively. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the change in base year, from May 2003 = 100 to November 2009 = 100, arose from the need to adjust the composite weights of the major commodity groups. The new basket contained new products which reflected the growing importance of expenditure on non-food items such as clothing and footwear, furnishings, household equipment and household maintenance, health, transport, communications, and education, while a few obsolete items in the basket were removed. The Committee believes that the impressive growth forecasts reflect prospects for continuing favourable rainfall in the remaining months of the rainy season to support the production of major crops across the country, coupled with the current peace in the Niger-Delta, which has boosted crude oil and natural gas production. Crude oil prices are expected to remain fairly stable at their current levels in the international market following the slow but steady economic recovery being recorded in most advanced economies. The MPC, however, cautioned that the projected slowdown in economic activity in some major advanced economies, including the US and emerging Asia poses a clear threat to the economies of commodity-producing countries like Nigeria. While urging greater efforts at diversifying the economy, the Committee stressed the need for policy reforms to address the binding growth constraints on the domestic economy, especially, infrastructural inadequacy. Similarly the core measure of inflation rose to 124 per cent in August 2010 from 113 per cent in July 2010, compared with 3 127 per cent in June 2010. Food inflation also increased to 151 per cent in August 2010 from 140 per cent in July 2010. The MPC welcomes the recent revision and rebasing of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to reflect the current structure of consumption in the economy. Based on the revised and rebased CPI, the year-on-year headline inflation rose to 137 per cent in August 2010 from 130 per cent in July 2010. Similarly core inflation increased to 124 per cent in August from 113 per cent in July 2010. Food inflation also trended upward to 151 per cent from 140 per cent in July 2010. The upward trend in the domestic price level could be attributed to the late commencement of rains in some food producing regions in the northern part of the country, which may have affected 3 the production/supply of some staple food items, while some non-food components of the new CPI basket also recorded price increases. The implications of the rebasing of the CPI for monetary policy were that the inflation rate based on the old index might have been under-estimated, while the declining weight of food in favour of non-food items indicated changes in the structure of prices in the economy in favour of non-food necessities for modern living, thus reducing the influence of volatile components in the CPI. The MPC reiterated its earlier position on the threat of inflationary pressure arising from several other factors including implementation of the new salary structure in the civil service, expected fiscal injections arising from electioneering expenses and the injections relating to AMCON purchase of non-performing loans of DMBs, spillover effects of the rising food prices from famine in neighboring Niger Republic and floods in Asia, deregulation of energy prices as well as the expected increase in household-spending toward year-end festivities. The Committee supports the deregulation policy of the Federal Government but would, continue to monitor price developments with a view to taking appropriate policy measures to stem any inflationary threat and ensure that the upside risk of inflation to growth is minimized. According to the report, while inflation trended upward during the review month, anticipated injection by the AMCON, expected fiscal injection from 2011 election expenses, payment of salary arrears to Federal civil servants, increased expenditure during the end of year festivities and the implementation of the CBN quantitative easing policy measures could constitute sources of further inflationary pressures. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments: Provisional data showed that relative to end-December 2009, broad money (M2) grew by 70 per cent in August 2010, which, when annualized represented a growth of 1050 per cent. Reserve money (RM), which stood at N1,,65386 billion at end-December 2009, fluctuated downward and by September 13, 2010, stood at N1,,40751 billion. iii) As at September 17, 2010, the inter-bank call and OBB rates rose to averages of 356 and 291 per cent, respectively, above their levels of 126 and 125 per cent in August 2010. Available data showed that in August 2010, aggregate domestic credit (net) grew by 180 per cent over the December 2009 level, and by 270 per cent when annualized. Credit to government (net), which grew substantially by 6581 per cent over end-December 2009 (or 9872 per cent on annualized basis), was the major contributor. Credit to the private sector, on the other hand, declined by 091 per cent (or 137 per cent on an annualized basis). The Committee believes that in order to provide the private sector with the necessary credit to 4 grow the economy, further efforts were needed to restore confidence to the credit market and to unlock the flow of credit to the real economy. In general monetary aggregates are growing but remain below indicative benchmarks for the year. The average maximum lending rate rose to 2231 per cent in August 2010 from 2227 per cent in July 2010. However the average prime lending rate consistently fell to 1689 per cent 4 in August 2010, from 1740 and 1765 per cent in July and June, 2010, respectively. The rates at the interbank segment of the money market remained stable and low, owing to the prevailing banking system liquidity and the de-risking of the market through the CBN guarantee of the interbank transactions. Consequently in August 2010, the average inter-bank call and open-buy-back (OBB) rates fell significantly to 126 and 125 per cent, respectively, representing decreases of 233 and 195 basis points from the 359 and 320 per cent recorded in the preceding month. In line with the decrease in rates at the inter-bank call and OBB segments, the 7- and 30- day NIBOR rates decreased by 62 and 196 basis points to 385 and 455 per cent, respectively, from 447 and 651 per cent in July. The weighted average savings rate declined consistently to 141 per cent in August 2010 from 162 and 195 per cent in July and June 2010, respectively. The consolidated deposit rate also declined to 227 per cent from 240 per cent in July 2010. As at September, 17, 2010, inter-bank call and OBB rates increased averaging 356 and 291 per cent, respectively. Thus the spread between the average maximum lending rate and the consolidated deposit rate widened marginally to 2004 per cent in August 2010 from 1987 per cent in July 2010. Developments in retail market interest rates indicated that the retail lending rates were still relatively high. The average maximum lending rate rose to 2231 per cent in August 2010 from 2227 per cent in July. However the average prime lending rate declined to 1689 per cent in August 2010, from 1740 per cent in July. iv) The average foreign exchange demand and sales per auction in August 2010 stood at $30990 million and $21650 million, representing a sales-demand ratio of 6986 per cent as against the average demand and sales of $22458 million and $20156 million in July 2010, or sales-demand ratio of 8979 per cent. The weighted average savings rate dropped to 141 per cent in August 2010 from 162 per cent in July. The consolidated deposit rates declined to 227 per cent in August 2010 from 240 per cent in July. Thus the spread between the average maximum lending rate and the consolidated deposit rate rose marginally to 2004 per cent in August 2010 from 1987 per cent in July. On September 17, 2010, the wDAS exchange rate closed at an average of N15096/US$1 as against an average of N15078/US$ in August 2010, indicating a depreciation of N018 or 011 per cent. In the BDC segment of the foreign exchange market, the average selling rates of N15350/US$ and N15223/US$ were recorded on September 17, 2010 and 5 August 2010, respectively, representing a depreciation of 083 per cent. Similarly in the inter-bank market, the average selling rates on September 17, 2010 and August 2010 were N15205/US$ and N15155/US$, respectively, indicating a depreciation of 033 per cent. The Committee noted that the key policy challenges remained the continuing sub-optimal growth in money supply coupled with the negative growth in private sector credit as well as the subsisting high retail lending rates in the face of substantially low wholesale inter-bank and retail deposit rates. The country's gross external reserves stood at US$3693 billion on 16th September, 2010, indicating a decline of US$021 billion or 061 per cent when compared with US$3716 billion at the end of July 2010. The reserve level fell by US$641 billion or 1497 per cent when compared with US$4334 billion as at end-September 2009. The available reserves level as at end-September could cover 18 months of import at the current level of utilisation. The Nigerian capital market, which was showing signs of recovery, recently turned bearish. Market capitalization (MC) - equities only, decreased by 87 per cent from N617 trillion to N563 trillion over the same period. The number of deals, volume and value of shares traded decreased by 46, 148 and 61 per cent, respectively. The decrease in ASI and MC was principally due to the share price decreases in the Banking. Food & Beverage, insurance and Oil/Gas sectors. The Committee believes that an early resolution of the leadership impasse at the NSE and effective take-off of the Asset Management Corporation (AMCON) would facilitate the return of the stock market to the path of recovery. Total foreign exchange inflows in July 2010 was US$225 billion, representing an increase of US$019 billion or 922 per cent over the US$206 billion recorded in June 2010. Of this inflow, crude oil/gas revenue was US$216 billion or 9397 per cent while the other sources of inflow contributed US$009 billion or 603 per cent. Total outflows for the same period amounted to US$403 billion, indicating an increase of US$015 billion or 378 per cent over the US$388 billion recorded in the preceding month. Thus there was a net 6 outflow of US$178 billion during the review period. Inflows from autonomous sources like oil companies, international institutions and home remittances in July and August 2010 amounted to US$53 billion and US$47 billion, respectively. External Sector Developments: The foreign exchange market remained relatively stable over the review period. Autonomous inflows from January to August 2010 totalled US$378 billion. These inflows helped to augment foreign exchange inflows from official sources and stabilized the exchange rate. The total foreign exchange inflow in July 2010 was US$225 billion, representing an increase of US$019 billion or 922 per cent over the US$206 billion recorded in the preceding month. Of this inflow, crude oil/gas revenue was US$216 billion or 9397 per cent while other inflows represented the balance of US$009 billion or 603 per cent. v) The retained revenue of the Federal Government in August 2010 was N17500 billion compared with an expenditure of N39079 billion during the month under review, resulting in a deficit of N21579 billion as against the proportionate budget deficit of N22215 billion for the month. The cumulative retained revenue of the Federal Government from January to August 2010 stood at N1,,57454 billion, which was lower than the proportionate budget revenue of N1,,66255 billion for the period by N8801 billion or 529 per cent. The cumulative expenditure of the Federal Government for the same period was estimated at N2,,41197 billion and was lower than the proportionate budget expenditure of N3,,43976 billion by N1,,02779 billion or 2988 per cent. The estimated deficit resulting from the projected expenditure for the period was 7 N83743 billion. Total outflows or payment in July 2010 amounted to US$403 billion, representing an increase of US$015 billion or 378 per cent above the US$388 billion recorded in the preceding month. Consequently the net outflow during the review period was US$178 billion. The report also showed that the total borrowing requirements of the Federal Government was N600 billion and that the Debt Management Office (DMO) would raise the sum of N150 billion every month beginning from September 2010 to the end of the year. Inflows from autonomous sources for the months of July and August 2010 were US$53 billion and US$47 billion, respectively. Over the period January to August 2010, total foreign exchange inflows to the market amounted to US$ 5200 billion comprising funds from the CBN amounting to US$1409 billion or 271 percent, while the balance of US$3791 billion (or 7291 percent) came from autonomous foreign exchange sources such as oil companies, international institutions and home remittances. The Committee noted with satisfaction that the autonomous inflows had helped in moderating demand pressure for foreign exchange in the WDAS segment of the foreign exchange market. Thus the autonomous inflows continue to augment the official inflow to ensure steady supply of foreign exchange to the market. The Committee was informed that three State Governments had accessed the capital market to raise funds through the issuance of bonds. These were Lagos State (N5750 billion). Bayelsa State (N500 billion), and Kaduna State (N850 billion). Ebonyi State was processing its application to raise N1650 billion before the end of the year. In August 2010, the WDAS rate opened at N15001/US$1 (inclusive of 1% commission) and closed at N15078/US$1, at an average exchange rate of N15027/US$1 for the month. This represented a depreciation of 17 kobo (011 per cent) when compared with the average closing rate of N15010/US$1 recorded in July 2010. As at 17th September, 2010 the exchange rate depreciated by 18k to N15096/US$1 (plus 1% commission) from N15078/US$1 recorded on August 31, 2010. vi) The broad measure of money supply (M2) increased by 70 per cent in August 2010, which when annualised, represented a rise of 1050 per cent compared with the indicative benchmark of 2926 per cent for 2010. The increase in the growth of M2 mainly reflected the substantial growth in credit to the Government. Aggregate credit to the economy grew by 180 per cent, which annualised to 270 per cent compared with the target credit growth of 5554 per cent for 2010. Credit to the private sector fell by 091 per cent in August 2010 or 137 per cent on annualised basis as against the benchmark of 8 3154 per cent for 2010. Credit to the core private sector declined by 078 per cent in August 2010 which annualized to 117 per cent. Credit to the government grew substantially by 6581 per cent in August 2010 or 9872 per cent on annualised basis compared with 5136 per cent indicative target for 2010. The BDC segment of the market recorded average selling rates of N15223/US$1 and N15241/US$1 in the months of August and July 2010 respectively, representing an appreciation of 011 per cent. At the inter-bank market, the average selling rates for August and July 2010 were N15070/US$ and N15027/US$ respectively, and represented a 03 per cent depreciation. As at September 17, 2010 the interbank and BDC rates were N15205/US$1 and N15350/US$1 respectively. The WDAS, interbank and BDC segments of the foreign exchange market witnessed mild naira exchange rate depreciation. The decline in reserve money (RM) observed since 2009 continued into the third quarter of 2010 and remained below the indicative benchmark. Reserve money, which stood at N1,,69129 billion as at end-August 2010, fell by 1678 per cent to N1,,40751 billion on September 13, 2010 and was below the indicative benchmark of N2,,00602 billion for the third quarter of 2010 by N59851 billion or 2983 per cent. The decline in RM was attributed to the sharp drop in DMB's deposits with the CBN which fell to N25770 billion on September 13, 2010 from N59679 billion as at end-August 2010, while currency in circulation increased to N1,,14981 billion on September 13, 2010 from N1,,0945 billion as at end- August 2010. Thus, the stability of the naira exchange rate attained in the foreign exchange market since the first half of 2009 continued into the third quarter of 2010. There was no request for the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) in August and up to September 17, 2010. The Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) fell to N13140 billion on September 17, 2010 from a monthly average of N29457 billion in August 2010. The Committee observed that the naira exchange rate had remained stable in all segments of the market during the review period, reflecting increased confidence and the efficacy of the current exchange rate policy stance. The MPC believes that the relative stability in the foreign exchange market was likely to be sustained in the near term. The Committee would continue to monitor developments in the market to ensure that measures are taken to eliminate speculative demand and exchange rate volatility. vii) The decline in key Nigerian capital market indicators continued. Similarly market capitalisation decreased by 87 per cent to N563 trillion on 17th September, 2010 from N617 trillion at end-June 2010. The number of deals, volume and value of shares traded fell by 46, 148 and 61 per cent, respectively. The decrease in ASI and MC was partly attributed to share price decreases in the banking, food/beverage, insurance and oil and gas sectors. The gross external reserves stood at US$36636 billion on 13th September, 2010 and represented a decrease of US$050 billion or 13 per cent when compared with the level of US$3716 billion as at end-July 2010. The Committee, however, noted that the current external reserves level is still adequate and is expected to remain robust in view of the favorable outlook for oil price and output. viii) Developments in the Global Economy: The performance of the global economy was mixed:  There was a mild threat of inflation observed in most of the countries surveyed;  Stock prices fell in most countries;  Exchange rate developments were mixed across countries. Consequently there is no compelling reason to alter the existing exchange rate regime stability will remain a priority. All the countries surveyed maintained their policy rates except Chile and South Africa which increased their policy rates. The Committee's Considerations The Committee, after a review of the domestic and international financial and economic developments, noted with satisfaction the sustained macroeconomic stability and welcomed the explicit commitment of the federal government to resume implementation of power sector reforms in line with the committee's recommendations at prior meeting. The Committee, however, sounded a note of caution on the possibility of inflationary build up arising from several other sources as has been highlighted earlier. Selected indicators for the US economy suggested a slow down in economic activities. The Committee noted that the resumption of growth in M2 is a welcome development, as it has reversed the stagnation recorded from January through June 2010. The Committee also observed the gradual restoration of financial stability and anticipated repair of banks' balance sheets when the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria becomes operational. In view of the foregoing the MPC underscored the importance of balancing the inflation risk with financial sector stability objective. 10  There was risk of economic downturn in Sub-Saharan Africa due to the European fiscal retrenchment. The MPC observed that the large demand for foreign exchange noticed during the review period resulted from among others, remittance of dividends by some companies and enhanced importation of refined petroleum products due to the Federal Government sovereign debt instruments. Thus there was no evidence of speculative demand or capital flight observed in the foreign exchange market. The global commodities market was affected by several natural disasters such as flooding in China and Pakistan as well as wild firestorms in Russia. Consequently commodity prices, especially food grains, trended upwards with the risk of inflation pass-through from major food exporters to consuming countries including Nigeria. The Committee noted the federal government's efforts to raise funds from the domestic capital market to execute vital infrastructural projects and urged for continuous coordination of monetary and fiscal policy as well as underscored the need for fiscal consolidation so as to ensure macroeconomic stability. The Committee commended the commitment of the Federal Ministry of Finance/Securities and Exchange Commission to the reforms in the capital market and efforts to get the oil/gas and telecommunication companies listed on the Exchange. The MPC further observed that the declining share of the banking sector in market capitalization is a positive development, which is good for rebalancing the market to reduce the overwhelming influence of the banking sub-sector. ix) Outlook for the Future  Money market rates and other interest rates were expected to remain low in the light of the existing guarantee of inter-bank fund transactions and anticipated liquidity injection. The MPC commended the government for resuming the power sector reforms and its decision to fast track them, which it believes will impact positively on the 9 cost structure of the economy. Furthermore the MPC commended and endorsed the CBN discussion with PENCOM aimed at realizing part of the accumulated pension funds to finance power sector projects on a long term basis. It noted that this initiative will assist in shielding the power sector funding from the vagaries of the volatility of the international capital market, and exchange and interest rate risks. There was heightened inflation risk thus making it difficult to realise the single digit inflation target for the year. Conclusion Having considered the above factors, the Committee considered it imperative to commence policy actions aimed at moderating the inflationary pressures in the economy, particularly given the outlook for government spending in an election year and the liquidity implications of the purchase of non-performing loans (NPLs) by AMCON. The Committee is satisfied that sufficient progress has been made in banking sector reforms to mitigate the risk of moderate tightening in financial institutions. The growth in M2 would likely improve in the fourth quarter following the implementation of the CBN quantitative easing measures such as utilisation of the N250 billion and N50 billion by the Power and Aviation sectors, respectively; refinancing/restructuring of DMB's exposures to manufacturers worth N200 billion, expected 11 huge electioneering expenses, payment of FGN workers' salary arrears; increased end of year festivities expenditures as well as the commencement of AMCON operations. Decisions In the light of the above, the MPC took the following decisions: 1. The Resumption of active Open Market Operations for the purpose of targeted liquidity management; 2. An increase in MPR by 25 basis points from 60 to 625 per cent ; and 3. Adjustment of asymmetric corridor to 200 basis points above and 300 basis points below the MPR for the Standing Lending Facility and Standing Deposit, respectively. This effectively increases interest payable on standing deposits with the CBN by 225 basis points forthwith. Reserve money (RM) would continue to be below the indicative benchmark in the near term. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria Abuja September 21, 2010 10. With increased oil production following relative peace in the Niger Delta region and higher oil prices expected to rise up to $84 a barrel and efficient tax collection. Federally-collected revenue would improve. The naira exchange rate would remain stable in the near term following the 2009 liberalization of the market, while foreign exchange from autonomous sources would continue to increase. The capital market was expected to resume its upward trend in the near term following on-going reforms in the market. Pressure Points and Policy Challenges The pressure points identified in the report were:  The continued under-performance of monetary aggregates  Heightened inflation threat resulting from anticipated 12 liquidity injections  High demand for FGN Bonds and possible market bubble. The challenges for monetary and credit policy in the near term were identified as:  provision of adequate incentives for banks to lend surplus funds to the real sector  sustaining exchange rate stability  avoiding the incidence of FGN Bond market bubble  Moderating inflationary expectations; and  Minimising the crowding out effect of increased issuance of bonds by both the Federal and States Governments. xi.) Update on the Implementation of Previous MPC Decisions before the September 21, 2010 Meeting: The updates were as follows: a) Of the N500 billion approved for power and aviation sectors as well as for the refinancing/restructuring of manufacturer's portfolios with the DMBs, about N199 billion had been paid to the Bank of Industry (BOI) for disbursement towards the refinancing/restructuring of manufacturers' exposures to the DMBs. b) The nominees for the Board of the AMCON were awaiting Senate confirmation. 13 c) Of the other liquidity injections approved by the CBN. N80701 billion had already been disbursed under the Commercial Agricultural Credit Scheme (CACS), while N36884 million had been paid by the Bank as its 60 per cent interest rebate obligation on 35 large scale agricultural projects"
United States,2010-09-21,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that the pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent months. Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising, though less rapidly than earlier in the year, while investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak. Employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Housing starts are at a depressed level. Bank lending has continued to contract, but at a reduced rate in recent months. The Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be modest in the near term. Measures of underlying inflation are currently at levels somewhat below those the Committee judges most consistent, over the longer run, with its mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to remain subdued for some time before rising to levels the Committee considers consistent with its mandate. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period. The Committee also will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and is prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A Duke; Sandra Pianalto; Eric S Rosengren; Daniel K Tarullo; and Kevin M Warsh. Voting against the policy was Thomas M Hoenig, who judged that the economy continues to recover at a moderate pace. Accordingly, he believed that continuing to express the expectation of exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period was no longer warranted and will lead to future imbalances that undermine stable long-run growth. In addition, given economic and financial conditions. Mr. Hoenig did not believe that continuing to reinvest principal payments from its securities holdings was required to support the Committee's policy objectives."
Czech Republic,2010-09-23,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 6th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments September 23, 2010 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Bank Board decided by a majority of the votes cast to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.75%. Six board members voted in favour of this decision and one member voted for increasing rates by 0.25 percentage point. Reasons for the decision According to the forecast, headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates close to their current levels initially, followed by a gradual rise in rates as from 2011 H2. Its growth was faster compared to the forecast (1.8% and 0.3% respectively); July annual growth of industrial production (5.3 %) indicates continuing recovery in economic activity; Signs of reversal are visible on the labour market. Nominal wages growth was modestly faster in Q2 (2.4%), the drop in employment halved (to -1.2%). ILO unemployment fell to 7.2%, and seasonally adjusted registered unemployment has been falling slightly in Q3; The August growth in industrial producer prices (1.8%) and a reversal of the decline in agricultural producer prices to growth (8.8%) are in line with growing commodity and food prices and gradual recovery in global economic growth.

Hungary,2010-09-27,"At its meeting on 27 September 2010, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 5.25%. In the Council's judgement, the Hungarian economy has begun to emerge from recession in 2010; however, output is likely to return to its potential level only slowly. Inflation is expected to ease back towards the Bank's 3% inflation target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy, due to the persistent weakness of domestic demand. Heightened perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy reflect the uncertainty felt by market participants. The near-term outlook for domestic growth continues to be shaped by the divergent trends in robust economic activity abroad and weak domestic demand. Strong external demand has been the main driver of Hungarian growth this year. Consumption demand has been flat because of households' uncertain income prospects and rises in monthly instalments on foreign currency loans, and is only likely to contribute to growth from 2011. The latest inflation data were consistent with the baseline projection in the latest Quarterly Report on Inflation. The effects of the weaker exchange rate are not yet reflected in consumer prices, but rises in food prices may add to inflationary pressure over the short term. Earnings data released since publication of the Report were more benign than expected. In the medium term, however, accumulated cost pressures at companies exercising restraint in their pricing policies may have an upward effect on inflation as demand gradually recovers. In terms of meeting the target, there is an upside risk that economic agents' inflation expectations will not be well anchored due to persistently above-target inflation. Global appetite for risk and perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have been volatile over the past month. The appreciation of the Swiss franc against the forint in recent months has placed a particularly heavy burden on households with loans denominated in francs. Borrowers' declining ability to repay their debts is likely to lead to a fall in bank earnings and a deterioration in credit quality, which, in turn, may prompt banks to reduce the supply of credit. The Government's declared commitment to meeting the 3% deficit target for 2011 is key to preserving investor confidence. Information on the Government's actions designed to meet the deficit target could contribute to an improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of recent developments in inflation and a prolonged period of output below potential. The extent to which persistently weak domestic demand will dampen the pass-through of cost shocks into prices continues to be a source of uncertainty in assessing the outlook for inflation. If upside risks to inflation materialise or there is an increase once again in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy, it may be necessary to raise the central bank base rate."
Israel,2010-09-27,"27.09.2010 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for October 2010 by 25 basis points to 2 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for October 2010 will increase by 25 basis points to 2 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The August CPI rose by 0.5 percent, above the range of forecasters' predictions of an increase of between 0 percent and 0.3 percent. The housing index, which increased by 1.7 percent, was again one of the main causes of the rise this month. Inflation in the last twelve months was 1.8 percent, within the inflation target range, for the third month in succession. Excluding the housing index, the CPI rose by only 0.7 percent in the last twelve months. Inflation and interest rate forecasts:Inflation expectations derived from the capital market and those of the private forecasters remained steady this month at slightly below the upper limit of the target range. Inflation measured over the previous twelve months is expected to remain around the midpoint of the target inflation range in the next few months. With regard to the Bank of Israel interest rate, expectations calculated from thecapital market are that the interest rate a year hence will be 2.8 percent, and the forecasters, on average, expect it to be 2.7 percent, levels similar to those in the previous month. The forecasts referred to by the Bank of Israel on average predicted an increase of 0.21 percentage points in the interest rate for October. Real economic activity: Initial data for the third quarter of 2010 present a mixed picture. Initial findings from the Bank of Israel Companies Survey for the third quarter suggest that activity continued to grow at a rate similar to that in the first half of the year; manufacturing production and sales of the principal industries continued to increase in July; the composite state-of-the-economy index, which is based partly on the last two components, i.e., manufacturing production and revenue of the principal industries, and on foreign trade data, rose moderately in August, followingthe increases in the previous months. Monthly foreign trade data, however,and figures of government tax revenues, were stable, possibly even showinga slowdown, although it is too soon to determine whether this represents aturning point in the rate of increase in activity. The overall picture obtained from the data appears to indicate that the output gap continues to decline. The Bank of Israel staff forecast is that inflation in the next twelve months will be 2.5 percent, with a gradual increase in the interest rate during that time to about 2.7 percent. The updated macroeconomic forecast of the Research Department is that GDP growth in 2010 will be about 4 percent. The labor market and wages: The labor market improved very considerably in the period from the beginning of 2009 to the second quarter of 2010. Labor market data this month give conflicting information: the August figures show an increase in the number of claims for unemployment benefits and a marked fall in the number of vacancies, as shown by the Central Bureauof Statistics Job Vacancies survey. In contrast, the Manpower Survey for the second quarter showed a continued decline in the rate of unemployment tothe low level of 6.2 percent. The ongoing contraction of the economy's excess production capacity is consistent with the rising trend in the nominal wage and the real wage in the last few months. Budget data: From the beginning of 2010 until August the domesticdeficit was NIS 12 billion, compared with NIS 16.3 billion in the equivalent period in 2009. On the basis of the current data, the deficit in 2010, excluding credit, is expected to be 4 percent of GDP, or even slightly lower. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on August 22 until September 24, the shekel appreciated by 2.4 percent against the dollar, and depreciated by 2.1 percent against the euro, in line with the trend in the international markets. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel strengthened by about 0.3 percent. In order to counteract the strengthening of the yen, the Bank of Japan intervened in the foreign exchange markets for the first time in six years. The capital and money markets:Between the monetary policy discussions of August 22 and September 24, the Tel Aviv 25 index rose by 5.6 percent, and the Tel Aviv 100 by 6.2 percent, and they are currently close to their previous peak levels. Most of the leading share price indices around the world also rose in this period. Yields on Israel government bonds increased this month along both the nominal and indexed yield curves. The yield gap between Israeli and US unindexed 10-year government bonds widened this month. There was renewed activity in corporate bond issues: the low rates of interest led to a steep increase in the extent of new issues, as companies tried to take advantage of cheap finance and the boom in funds that specialize in corporate bonds. The Tel-Bond 20 and the Tel-Bond 40 indices declined by about 0.3 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread fell slightly this month to about 121 basis points. The money supply: The M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) dropped by 1.4 percent in August, following its 3 percent increase in July, which was due partly to the strong seasonal factor. In the last twelve months M 1 increased at a low rate of 1.4 percent. TheM 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) decreased by 1.3 percent, in August, following its 0.3 percent increase in July; in the last twelve months it increased by 0.5 percent. The credit market: Total outstanding business sector credit increased slightly in July to NIS 746 billion, following its 1 percent increase in June. Bank credit accounted for NIS 394 billion, an increase of 1 percent from its June level. Outstanding nonbank credit (corporate bonds and nonbank loans) remained steady in July, at about NIS 220 billion. Credit to households increased by 1.2 percent in June, to NIS 329 billion. New mortgageswere 7 percent higher in August than in July, when they dropped by 10 percent; their level in August was significantly above their average level in 2009. The rates of interest on fixed- and floating-interest indexed mortgages continued to fall, while interest rates on floating-rate mortgages indexed to prime increased following the increase in the Bank of Israel interest rate for August. The housing market: House prices, as shown in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices (which are not included in the CPI) continued to rise, albeit more slowly than previously: in June/July they increased by 0.7 percent, following their increase of 2.2 percent in May/June. House prices have risen by 20 percent in the last twelve months. The housing component in the CPI, which is based mainly on renewed rental contracts, continued its upward trend, and rose by 1.7 percent in August. Some of thisrise may be a reaction to the continued steep increases in house prices. The global economy: The economic recovery world wide continued in the second quarter of 2010, but some recent developments have given rise to concerns over the sustainability of worldwide growth, and it is assessed that the growth rate will slow in the second half of the year. The recoveryis not uniform: growth in the leading advanced economies is fragile, with stronger growth in the emerging market economies. Concern over a return to recession eased, however, and growth is expected to continue, albeit at a slow rate, below the long-term trend levels. Against this background forecasters revised their growth forecasts downwards this month. The financial markets were highly volatile, against the background of the mixed macroeconomic data and the high level of uncertainty. Overall inflation indices rose following the increase in commodity prices, but inflation is still low and isexpected to remain so in the major economies, particularly in light of excess production capacity. In some economies, however, inflationary pressure is still evident. On the monetary side, in light of the high level of uncertainty and the remaining signs of weakness in the global economy, the leading central banks are expected to keep their interest rates low, and to continue with quantitative easing. That said, the central banks of Canada and Sweden increased their interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month. On the fiscal side, the large-scale easing is expected to moderate, due to large deficits. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to increase the interest rate for October to 2 percent is consistent with the gradual process of returning the interest rate to a more'normal' level, intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to support the further recovery of economic activity, while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate is not pre-determined, but is set in accordance with the inflation environment, growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the leading central banks, and developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. At the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. Inflation in the last twelve months was close to the midpoint of the target inflationrange, but inflation expectations calculated from the capital market for one year ahead and those of the private forecasters remain in the area of the upper limit of the target inflation range, with the interest rate expected to rise to about 2.7 percent in a year's time. House prices are still increasing steeply, and housing loans continue to expand rapidly reflecting the low rate of interest and the slow adjustment of the supply of houses. The housing component of the CPI is still rising, at an even slightly faster pace than in recent months. Most recentindicators of real economic activity point to continued rapid expansion in the third quarter--in particular, initial data from the Companies Survey for the third quarter, which suggest that economic activity continued to expand at a similar rate to that in the first half-year, the steep decline in the rate of unemployment in the second quarter, and first signs of increases in the real and nominal wage indicate the continued contraction in Israel's output gap. The decision to increase the interest rate was taken despite the fact that interest rates of the central banks of the major advanced economies are at very low levels, and in light of recent developments are expected to remain so for some considerable time. Nevertheless, central banks in several countries that are already growing relatively rapidly continued with the process of increasing their interest rates last month too, and are expected tocontinue to do so in the near future. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic and financial developments, and will use the instruments available to itto achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the housing market, and specially on house prices. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on October 11, 2010. The decision regarding the interest rate for November 2010 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. October 25, 2010. 27.09.2010 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for October 2010 by 25 basis points to 2 percent. The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for October 2010 by. 25 basis points to 2 percent.

Pakistan,2010-09-29,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 29th September 2010 The recent catastrophic floods have serious implications for macroeconomic stability and growth prospects. However even before the floods, the macroeconomic conditions and outlook were looking fragile. By the close of FY10, inflation was high and the fiscal deficit had risen to. percent of GDP. Early assessments indicated that these pressures were unlikely to abate in FY11. Post-flood projections raise legitimate concerns about the worsening of the macroeconomic balances since the initiatives required to address the underlying cause for the primary stimulus to aggregate demand, coming from the fiscal side, have yet to be launched with vigour and coherence. They show that inflation will increase further accompanied by drop in economic growth, both the trade balance and fiscal accounts will be under stress, and the banking system may witness pressure on account of rise in NPLs of the private sector and borrowings of the government, unless comprehensive and coordinated response is developed to meet these challenges. The clarity on the nature and scale of such package would depend on the complete assessment of losses to the economy expected to be completed in October 2010. Nevertheless the components of the economic strategy that would need to continue to be in focus despite uncertainty would include implementation of tax reforms to enhance much needed revenues, resolution of the energy sector subsidies and circular debt to restore economic growth, relief measures for those affected by the floods, and containment of government borrowing from SBP to restrict inflation. Committed and credible progress on these fronts will be critical for reviving confidence and stability and stimulating economic growth, otherwise the burden of any adjustment will continue to fall on the engine of growth, the private sector. Given the scale of the devastation caused by the recent calamity, it is difficult to fully and accurately determine the extent of damage to the economy. Losses in agriculture and infrastructure are more direct and visible while the impact on industry and opportunities for the work force is going to be indirect and nuanced. Highly provisional estimates suggest that economic growth for FY11 could come down to. percent from an earlier target of. percent. While aggregate private consumption may decelerate as result that of the government will most likely increase to meet the urgent needs of the flood victims and their rehabilitation, leading to sharper deterioration of the fiscal accounts. The disruption in the supply chain of food items caused the month-on-month (MoM) food inflation to jump to. percent in August 2010, pushing the MoM CPI inflation to. percent. In SBP's assessment this temporary spike in prices is largely due to floods as it is over and above the average MoM growth in food inflation (1. percent) and CPI inflation (1. percent) during Ramazan in the previous five years. It may take two to three months for food inflation to return to normal levels. Slowdown in private demand later in the year will at best have moderating effect on CPI inflation as it is likely to be neutralized by an expected increase in government spending in general and on reconstruction in the flood affected areas in particular. It is estimated that average CPI inflation for FY11 may fall between 13. and 14. percent. Further likely increases in electricity prices, induction of the Reformed GST and continued reliance of the government on borrowings from the SBP only add to the uncertainty surrounding inflation expectations. Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN In the aftermath of the floods, bringing inflation down to single digits would require supportive and sustained financial and fiscal effort over the next couple of years. Better management of financial resources including more transparency and timely availability of fiscal figures, broadening of the tax base, controlling discretionary current expenditures and re-prioritizing development expenditures would be imperative for fiscal consolidation. These steps would remove any ambiguity arising from the pre-flood budget for FY11, which initially announced deficit of percent that shot up to. percent of GDP after the combined provincial budgets were unveiled. How the fiscal policy response to the floods is incorporated in the revised budget remains to be seen, but it is clear that even attaining the deficit of. percent of GDP will require considerable adjustment in the key fiscal parameters. The year-on-year growth of. percent in the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) tax revenues during the first two months of FY11 compared to the budget target of 25. percent for the full year does not instil much confidence. To finance the budget deficit the government has increased its reliance on the SBP; it borrowed Rs220 billion during 1st July 24th September. FY11 according to provisional figures compared to Rs126 billion during the corresponding period of last year. This is against the spirit of macroeconomic stabilization, since the elimination of government borrowing from the SBP was one of the main commitments of such program. Moreover given the heavy borrowings from the scheduled banks over the last couple of years through short term Treasury Bills (T-bills) there is significant ‘rollover risk' during FY11. Fresh borrowings from the banking system during FY11 will increase these borrowings even further, especially if the spending requirements increase and there is no commensurate increase in tax revenues. This entails substantial risks to economic stability in the immediate future and places considerable pressure in the medium term on the already high debt burden of the country. Rising NPLs and relatively low private sector credit demand may incentivize the already risk shy banks to meet government's borrowing requirements at the cost of private investment in the economy. This could make the task of reviving economic growth and bringing inflation down to single digit level much more difficult. The dependence on foreign borrowings has also increased due to continuous decline in domestic national savings and private foreign investments in the country. The substantial narrowing of the external current account deficit in FY10 provided some breathing space. After registering reduction of. percent in FY10, imports seem all set to grow significantly, especially after the floods, and may post double digit growth in FY11. Although the growth in exports was also projected to increase in FY11, the recent floods and the resulting disruption in productive activity could act as dampener if the damage to the cotton crop turns out to be extensive. Thus the expected increase in the external current account deficit and uncertain foreign inflows could put pressure on SBP's foreign exchange reserves and exchange rate in FY11. In these circumstances, most of the expansion in broad money in FY11 is expected to be driven by considerable growth in the Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the banking system accompanied by possible decline in the Net Foreign Assets (NFA), which does not bode well for the inflation outlook. Thus there may be possible liquidity pressures in the market. The SBP stands ready to manage the system wide liquidity and maintain the short term interest rates consistent with its monetary policy stance. However more is expected from the fiscal Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN authority to articulate and implement coherent strategy and the market continues to look to government for greater fiscal discipline to allay expectations of rising inflation. The key features of this strategy, as already mentioned above, will have to include broadening of the tax base, adhering to the principles of the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act (2005) in letter and spirit and restriction of government borrowing from the SBP. Failure to do so will only increase the economy's reliance on foreign borrowings with its own complications and risks. The next quarter will be crucial in forming an assessment of the effectiveness of government efforts to contain the fiscal deficit and its inflationary borrowings from the SBP and the banking system. On its part, the SBP is raising its policy rate by 50 basis points to 13. percent with effect from 30th September 2010. The monetary policy stance is formed by the consideration that the impact of continued inflation is substantial and felt by the entire economy. tightening of the stance is thus called for in full recognition that the difficulty to contain fiscal deficit has resulted in the private sector bearing the full brunt of such an adjustment.

Poland,2010-09-29,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 29 September 2010 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 28-29 September 2010 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate at 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) discount rate at 4.00% on an annual basis. Modest recovery in the global economy has continued and its pace in the second half of 2010 is likely to be lower than in the first half of the year. In the developed countries adjustments in the balance sheets of households, enterprises and financial institutions together with persistently unfavourable situation in the labour market, are conducive to weakening economic growth in the subsequent quarters. The effects of high fiscal imbalance and its anticipated reduction, as well as of monetary expansion, including non-conventional measures undertaken by central banks constitute an important risk factor for economic growth in those countries. At the same time, continuing high economic growth in major emerging economies supports global economic activity. In the past few months prices of some agricultural commodities in the global markets have increased markedly. At the same time, the observed alleviation of tensions in the financial markets have favoured the inflow of capital to emerging economies and the appreciation of those countries' currencies, including the appreciation of the zloty. According to GUS preliminary estimates in 2010 Q2. GDP rose by 3.5% y/y (as compared to 3.0% y/y in 2010 Q1). This was mainly driven by a rise in the domestic demand related to accelerating growth in the consumption demand and the continuing rebuilding of inventories. Gross fixed capital formation continued to decrease, yet, its decline was lower that in the previous quarter. Higher GDP growth was accompanied by a rise in the number of the economically active persons, including a rise in the number of working persons, and by continuing moderate wage growth. At the same time, financial situation of enterprises improved. The data on the Polish economy in 2010 Q3 point at a gradual stabilisation of economic growth. Industrial output continues to grow rapidly; growth, yet irregular, has also been registered in the construction and retail sales. Capacity utilization in enterprises continues to grow gradually. Yet, certain deterioration has been seen in the enterprises' and households' assessment of the future economic situation. The situation in the labour market has been improving gradually which is reflected in the continuing rise of employment in enterprises and falling unemployment rate. Lending to enterprises remains limited, mainly due to reasons related to the demand for credit. Growth in household mortgage lending continues to rise gradually. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. In August 2010 the annual CPI inflation amounted to 2.0%, thus remained below the NBP inflation target set at 2.5%. Core inflation continued at a low level. Yet, the majority of measures of inflation expectation exceed the current CPI inflation. High growth has been recorded in producer prices. In the subsequent months rising food and energy prices may contribute to a gradual rise in CPI inflation; in 2011 the level of prices may also be slightly increased by the announced change in VAT rates. In the Council's assessment, moderate economic growth and the accompanying limited wage and inflationary pressures, along with the risk of weakening global economic growth in the subsequent quarters justify keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged. At the same time, the Council will analyse the signs of a possible rise in inflationary pressure, and will follow the developments in inflation expectations. An important factor affecting monetary policy is the situation of public finance. Introducing decisive measures aimed at permanently reducing the deficit of the general government sector and at curbing the increase of the public debt is necessary for macroeconomic stability and will allow the meeting of euro adoption criteria. In the opinion of the Council, introducing measures aimed at preventing fast growth in foreign currency lending to households is important for macroeconomic stability. Such measures can also contribute to increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission mechanism. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the ERM II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organisational conditions. The Council adopted the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2011 and approved the document International Investment Position of Poland in 2009."
Romania,2010-09-29,"In its meeting of September 29, 2010, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR Board is restating that the central bank is vigilantly monitoring domestic and global economic developments so as, via an adequate use of its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. The standard value added tax hike starting from July 1, 2010, triggered an upswing in the annual inflation rate to 7.58 percent in August versus 7.14 percent the previous month and 4.38 percent in June. At the same time, annual adjusted CORE2 1 inflation rose to 4.5 percent in August after it had stayed around two percent in the first half of 2010. The increase in annual inflation rate has nevertheless been marginally lower than that projected in the most recent forecasting exercise, reflecting a relatively slower pass-through of the VAT hike to consumer prices, given the persistence of the negative output gap. On the other hand, concerns remain regarding the potential significant second round effects of the VAT increase. The analysis of macroeconomic developments shows a continued fast increase in exports, also reflected in import flows, along with a sustained industrial output dynamics, but also the fact that the annual dynamics of indicators relevant for the trends in the domestic demand stayed in the negative territory. In the monetary area, it is worth noting that the real annual expansion of lending to the private sector remained negative while its leu and foreign-currency denominated components have exhibited divergent evolutions, as well as a continued rapid advance of credit to the government. The short-term outlook indicates risks related to evolutions in administered and volatile food prices, in a seasonal context and due to base effects, as well as the persistence of uncertainties regarding the impact of fiscal consolidation measures, which, amid the current domestic social and political developments, require the maintenance of a prudent monetary policy stance in a bid to firmly anchor inflation expectations. In this context, the NBR Board has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 6.25 percent per annum and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board has also decided to ensure adequate management of liquidity in the banking system. The resumption of disinflation with a view to fulfilling the medium-term inflation targets and ensuring a sustainable economic growth essentially hinges on a firm implementation of the macroeconomic policy mix and of the structural reforms in line with commitments set under the multilateral external financing arrangement with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for November 2, 2010, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1) Calculated by the NBR by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index."
Philippines,2010-10-06,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. The policy rates have been steady since July 2009. The Monetary Board's decision was based on its evaluation that monetary policy settings remain appropriate as inflation forecasts continue to be within target range of 4.5 ± 1 percent for 2010 and 4 ± 1 percent for 2011 and 2012. Inflation expectations remain within target as well. The low actual inflation of 3.5 percent in September is also consistent with the benign inflation environment. The Monetary Board noted that the economy continues to be where the goal of safeguarding inflation is compatible with helping support economic activity, as inflation remains low even as demand has strengthened. This can be traced to a number of factors, including the recent build-up of capital, which could have added to the economy's productive capacity, thus tempering demand-induced price pressures. Inflation expectations also continue to be well anchored, thus moderating any upward pull on prices. In addition, global economic conditions point to a tepid demand recovery, keeping a lid on imported price pressures. Sustained foreign exchange inflows, which in part reflect a broader trend in capital flows in favor of emerging market economies like the Philippines, also provide a cushion to the domestic economy from imported inflation. Notwithstanding the benign inflation outlook, the Monetary Board will remain on the lookout for inflationary pressures going forward to ensure that monetary policy settings continue to be appropriate."
Euroarea,2010-10-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council continues to view the current key ECB interest rates as appropriate. Considering all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 2 September 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Recent economic data are consistent with our expectation that the recovery should proceed at a moderate pace in the second half of this year, with the underlying momentum remaining positive. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. We expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Overall, the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. The stance, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP grew strongly on a quarterly basis, increasing by 1.0% in the second quarter of 2010, supported mainly by domestic demand, but partly reflecting temporary factors. Recent statistical releases and survey evidence generally confirm our expectation of a moderation in the second half of this year in the euro area and elsewhere. Nevertheless, the positive underlying momentum of the recovery in the euro area remains in place. The global recovery is expected to go on, and this should imply a continued positive impact on the demand for euro area exports. At the same time, private sector domestic demand should gradually strengthen further, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are slightly tilted to the downside, with uncertainty still prevailing. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. On the other hand, concerns remain relating to the emergence of renewed tensions in financial markets. In addition, downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, and protectionist pressures, as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.8% in September, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, compared with 1.6% in August. The increase in inflation was anticipated and reflects base effects mainly stemming from the energy component. In the next few months HICP inflation rates will hover around current levels before moderating again in the course of next year. Overall, in 2011 inflation rates should remain moderate, benefiting from low domestic price pressures. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the outlook for price developments are slightly tilted to the upside. They relate, in particular, to the evolution of energy and non-oil commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are contained. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 rose to 1.1% in August 2010, from 0.2% in July. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also rose, standing at 1.2%, after 0.8% in the previous month. In both cases, the rise reflects relatively strong monthly flows. The still low growth rates continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. The yield curve has remained fairly steep, but the downward impact of this on monetary growth is gradually waning. Moreover, while spreads between different short-term interest rates are still generally narrow, they have been widening somewhat between rates paid on short-term time deposits and overnight deposits. As a result, the annual growth rate of M1 has continued to moderate from high levels, and stood at 7.7% in August 2010, while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits has become less negative. The rise in the annual growth rate of bank loans to the non-financial private sector reflects both a further slight increase in the positive growth of loans to households and a gradually less negative annual growth rate in loans to non-financial corporations. The latest developments are consistent with the lagged response of loan developments to economic activity over the business cycle that was also observed in past cycles. Banks have gradually increased the overall size of their balance sheets recently, but the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up further. Where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Considering all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 2 September 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Recent economic data are consistent with our expectation that the recovery should proceed at a moderate pace in the second half of this year, with the underlying momentum remaining positive. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained, as suggested by weak money and credit growth. We expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, we take note of the recent announcements made in some euro area countries with regard to measures to tackle the existing fiscal imbalances. Indeed, a number of countries have to meet major challenges, and immediate, ambitious and convincing corrective action is required. Credible multi-year consolidation plans are needed and will strengthen public confidence in the capacity of governments to return to sustainable public finances, reduce risk premia in interest rates and thus support sustainable growth over the medium term. For all euro area countries, the 2011 budgets need to reflect the commitment to ambitious fiscal consolidation in line with countries' pledges under the excessive deficit procedures. Any positive fiscal developments that may emerge, reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected environment, should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation. The urgent implementation of far-reaching structural reforms is essential to enhance the prospects for higher sustainable growth. Major reforms are particularly needed in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. The removal of labour market rigidities and the strengthening of productivity growth would further support the adjustment process of these economies. Increasing product market competition, particularly in the services sectors, would also facilitate industrial restructuring and encourage innovation and the adoption of new technologies."
Chile,2010-10-14,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 14 October 2010 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.75% (annual). Internationally, a moderated growth scenario has consolidated in developed countries, which contrasts with the strength of emerging market economies. In this context, long- term interest rates show a generalized reduction in the main economies, the dollar has depreciated in world markets and commodity prices have shown an additional rebound in the past several weeks. Slower than expected recovery in developed countries is an important risk factor facing emerging economies. Domestically, output figures indicate strong economic growth, in line with the scenario assumed in September's Monetary Policy Report. Inflation has been somewhat less than expected. Private inflation expectations show a slight reduction in the short- and medium-term horizons, from the upper half of the tolerance range to levels centered around 3% y-o-y. The peso has continued to appreciate against the dollar. The Board will continue to reduce the current monetary policy stimulus at a pace that will depend on the unfolding of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions. Accordingly, the Board reiterates that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2010-10-14,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.25%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.25%) for the intermeeting period. In the global economy, emerging market economies have sustained their favorable performance, and the economies of major advanced countries have largely continued their moderate recovery trend, even though the pace of the recovery in the US economy has slowed somewhat. Looking ahead, there exists the possibility of the heightened volatility of economic activity and exchange rates in major countries acting as a risk factor for the global economy. The underlying upward trend of domestic business activity has been maintained. Even though consumption has faltered, exports have sustained their buoyancy and facilities investment has increased. And, led by the private sector, labor market conditions have shown an improving trend. The domestic economy is expected to continue on an underlying upward track, even in the presence of external risk. Consumer price inflation has increased due to a sudden rise in farm product prices, and in the future, upward pressures on the demand side are expected to continue, being associated with the continued upswing in activity. In the real estate market, housing sales prices have continued to decline in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while those in other areas have maintained their increase. In the financial markets, stock prices have risen, the Korean won has appreciated, and market interest rates have declined in response chiefly to the expanded inflow of foreign portfolio investment funds. The scale of the growth in mortgage lending has widened due to the increase in the numbers of newly occupied apartments, even though house transactions have been inactive. Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy in such a way as to help the economy maintain price stability, while sustaining sound growth under the accommodative policy stance. In carrying out policy, it will take overall account of financial and economic conditions at home and abroad."
Turkiye,2010-10-14,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) was kept constant at 7 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate was reduced from 6.25 percent to 5.75 percent, while lending rate was kept constant at 8.75 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate was reduced from 2.25 percent to 1.75 percent, while lending rate was kept at 11.75 percent, d) The interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions was kept constant at 7.75 percent. Recent data releases suggest that economic activity continues to recover. Uncertainties regarding external demand persist, while domestic demand displays a relatively stronger outlook. It would take a while before industrial capacity utilization rates return to their pre-crisis levels. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates remain at high levels. It is expected that inflation would be on a declining path in the forthcoming period, while core inflation would remain consistent with the medium-term targets. In light of these assessments, the Committee has reiterated that it would be necessary to maintain policy rates at current levels for some time, and to keep them at low levels for a long period. On the other hand, in order to enhance the efficient functioning of the Turkish lira market, the Committee has decided to reduce the borrowing rates by 50 basis points. Expectations of more accommodative monetary policies in developed economies have been leading to a surge in capital flows toward emerging markets. This development, coupled with the relative improvement in the creditworthiness of Turkey, exacerbates the risks related to the divergence between the domestic and external demand. While not yet a significant concern regarding financial stability, the Committee has indicated that these developments support the implementation of the “exit strategy” measures. Therefore, the Committee has indicated that it would be appropriate to proceed with the remaining measures outlined in the exit strategy that were envisaged to be implemented by the end of 2010. Moreover, the Committee has judged that the 3-month repo funding is no longer needed. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Peru,2010-10-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2010 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 3.0 percent. This decision takes into account the recent evolution of inflation and its determinants, which advises to make a pause in the preventive adjustments of the reference rate initiated in May of this year. Current and advanced indicators of activity show a slight moderation in the growth of economic activity, in line with the forecasts of our Inflation Report. Future adjustments in the reference rate will depend on new information on the evolution of inflation and its determinants. Inflation in September recorded a rate of -0.03 percent, mainly as a result of the decline of food prices. With this, annual inflation recorded 2.37 percent. Core inflation, which showed a rate of 0.14 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 1.88 percent and remains around the 2 percent target. Moreover, inflation without considering food and energy fell from 1.15 percent in August to 1.12 percent in September. Inflation expectations remain anchored within the tolerance range. Indicators of economic activity in September show a moderation of growth. The production of electricity increased 7.6 percent (9.2 percent in August) and the demand for cement is estimated to have grown 11.0 percent (11.1 percent in August). Moreover, indicators of global economic activity confirm projections of a more moderate growth in the following quarters. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 3.80 percent. Overnight deposits: 2.20 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for November on its session of November 11, 2010."
Thailand,2010-10-20,"No 48/ 2010 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 20 October 2010 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Assistant Governor. Bank of Thailand, announces the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, as follows. The global economy continued to recover but is expected to slow somewhat in the period ahead. The US and Japanese economies remain fragile due to risks from high unemployment and the sluggish recovery in consumption. The European economies still face the challenge of managing high fiscal deficits next year. Meanwhile Asian economies continue to grow robustly, driven by consumption and investment. The Thai economy is expected to grow primarily due to domestic demand. Nevertheless the risk that decelerated global growth may adversely impact Thai exports remains. Meanwhile the outlook on inflation pressure remains unchanged. While the interest rate normalization in Thailand is ongoing, the global economic recovery is now expected to slow in tandem with an increase in uncertainty in the world economy and financial markets compared to the last MPC meeting. The MPC therefore decided to maintain the policy interest rate for the time being at 175 per cent per annum."
Hungary,2010-10-25,"At its meeting on 25 October 2010, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 5.25%. In the Council's judgement, the Hungarian economy has begun to emerge from recession in the course of 2010; however, output is likely to return to its potential level only slowly. Weak domestic demand continues to exert a dampening influence on inflation. The proposed government measures may result in a marked change in the outlook for the economy, adding to the upside risks to inflation and increasing uncertainty in the investment environment. The Monetary Council will assess the likely quantitative impact of these measures in light of the November Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the short term, buoyant external demand may continue to be the engine of growth for the Hungarian economy. Growth in employment and the proposed cut in personal income tax rates may help to strengthen consumption demand next year. The introduction of windfall taxes may reduce the predictability of the taxation system, which, in turn, may weigh on firms' investment intentions. Recent inflation data suggest that the pass-through of the weaker exchange rate into consumer prices may be slower than expected, which, however, may be offset in the short term by an increase in food prices. In the medium term, accumulated cost pressures at companies exercising restraint in their pricing policies may have an upward effect on inflation as demand gradually recovers, which may also be reflected in core inflation developments. The possibility that some industries will pass the cost of the windfall tax on to consumers may also put upward pressure on inflation. This effect may be mitigated if private sector firms take account of the Government's personal income tax measures in setting next year's wages, which could lead to a fall in their wage bill. With respect to meeting the inflation target, there continues to be an upside risk to the extent that economic agents' inflation expectations are not firmly anchored due to persistently above-target inflation. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have improved slightly over the past month, due partly to the increase in global risk appetite and partly to the Government's continued commitment to meeting the 2011 deficit target of 3%. In the Council's view, while the proposed government measures are expected to have an overall positive influence on labour supply, they will reduce the predictability of the economic environment, and therefore their impact on longer-term growth is uncertain. While the government deficit on an ESA95 basis will fall, the structural position, which is a key factor in terms of longer-term developments, will deteriorate significantly, because the effects of the tax changes resulting in persistent revenue shortfalls will be offset by temporary measures proposed to improve the fiscal balance. Consequently, achieving a long-term sustainable path for the fiscal budget will require additional structural measures on the expenditure side. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the uncertainty about the inflation outlook and a prolonged period of output below potential. If upside risks to inflation materialise or there is a sustained increase in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy, an increase in the central bank base rate may be necessary."
Israel,2010-10-25,"25.10.2010 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for November 2010 unchanged at 2 percent The Supervisor of Banks has published new directives regarding floating-interest leveraged housing Background conditions Inflation data: The September CPI rose by 0.3 percent, slightly more than the average of forecasters' predictions of an increase of 0.2 percent. The rise was due mainly to increases in prices of fruit and vegetablesand housing. Inflation in the last twelve months was 2.4 percent, within the price-stability target range. Since the beginning of 2010 the CPI has risen by 1.9 percent. Excluding the housing index, which has risen by 5.6 percent since the beginning of the year, the CPI rose by only 0.8 percent in January-September 2010. The rise in the overall CPI from the beginning of the year to September is consistent with inflation of 2.4 percent in the year 2010. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Twelve-month inflation expectations derived from the capital market remained steady, close to the upper limit of the target inflation range; private forecasters' expectations for the increases in the next twelve CPIs declined slightly this month to 2.9 percent. On average, the forecasters expect inflation in 2010 to be 2.4 percent. The Bank of Israel interest rate a year hence is expected to be 2.7 percent. Most forecasters expect no change in the Bank of Israel interest rate for November. Real economic activity: Economic data published this month show that the pace of growth slowed somewhat. Foreign trade data (seasonally adjusted) show a 4.6 percent drop in exports in the third quarter compared withthe second quarter, and a small 0.5 percent increase in imports; the Purchasing Managers Index stayed at the low level it had reached in the second quarter; the Google Search Index calculated by the Bank of Israel Research Department points to some increase in the probability of a recession. In contrast to these indications, according to the Bank of Israel Companies Survey for the third quarter, companies reported a continued increase in activity in the third quarter, with the increase encompassing all industries apartfrom construction. Furthermore, both the domestic market and exports grew.All the components of tax revenues increased in September, another factor consistent with expanded activity. The Globes and the Bank Hapoalim consumer confidence indices both rose again in September, following their rise in August. The Bank of Israel staff forecast is that inflation in the next twelve months will be 2.5 percent, with a gradual increase in the interest rate to about 2.9 percent by the end of 2011. Risks to real activity and inflation in Israel derive essentially from developments abroad. The labor market and wages: Labor market data this month also present a mixed picture. The Ministry of Industry. Trade and Labor Employers Survey for the third quarter reported a small increase in the demand for employees. The balance of employment (the difference between the number of vacancies filled and the number of terminations of employment) remained positive, but lower than that in the second quarter. The number of claims for unemployment benefits increased in August. Central Bureau of Statistics data for September show a 1.4 percent increase in the number of vacancies over the number in August. Health Tax receipts in September also indicate a continued increase in total wage payments. The rising trend in the nominal and real wage evident in the last few months reversed in July, with a decline of 0.8 percent in the nominal wage, and of 0.6 percent in the real wage (both seasonally adjusted). Budget data: From the beginning of 2010 until September the domestic deficit was NIS 10.9 billion, compared with NIS 19.6 billion in January-September 2009. On the basis of the current data, the deficit in 2010, excluding credit, is expected to be 4 percent of GDP, or even lower. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on September 26 until October 22, the shekel appreciated by 1.5 percent against the dollar, and depreciated by 2.4 percent against the euro, inline with the trends in the international markets. In terms of the nominaleffective exchange rate, the shekel depreciated by 0.5 percent in this period. The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of September 26 and October 22, the Tel Aviv share price indices showed trends similar to those in most stock markets abroad: the Tel Aviv 25 index rose by 3.7 percent, surpassing its previous peak level (recorded in April this year). Yields on Israeli government bonds declined in general in this period, and yields on makam fell along almost the entire curve. Yields on local-currency government bonds showed mixed trends: the curve flattened, with yields up to three years increasing, and yields on medium- and long-term bonds falling. Yields on CPI-indexed government bonds declined steeplyalong the whole curve. The yield gap between Israeli and US unindexed 10-year government bonds contracted slightly this month. In the corporate bond market the Tel-Bond 20 and the Tel-Bond 40 indices rose by 3.3 percent, andthe yield gap between them and government bonds narrowed. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread fell slightly this month, in line with the trend around the world, and reached 116 basis points. The money supply: The M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 2.4 percent in September, following its 0.6 percent decrease in August. In the last twelve months the M 1 aggregate increased by 4.2 percent. The M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 1.7 percent in September, following its 1.2 percent decline in August; in the last twelve months it increased by 1 percent. The credit market: Total outstanding business sector credit increased by 1.2 percent in August, to NIS 755 billion, after remaining unchanged in July. In this total, bank credit also increased by 1.2 percent from its July level. Outstanding nonbank credit (corporate bonds and nonbank loans) remained steady in August. Credit to households increased by 0.9 percent in August. New mortgages dropped sharply in September from their August level. It should be noted that the Jewish High Holydays occurred in September this year, and the decline in new mortgages in September followedthree months of high mortgage figures, largely due to seasonal factors. The housing market: House prices--which are presented in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices and which are not included in the CPI--increased again, at an even faster rate of 1.3 percent in July-August compared with an increase of 0.7 percent in June-July. Since the beginning of the year house prices have risen by 9.7 percent, and in the last twelve months by 19.0 percent. Some of the rise in the rental cost of housing, which is included in the CPI, is apparently due to the persistent and steep increase in house prices. The global economy: In October the IMF increased its forecast of global growth in 2010 from 4.6 percent to 4.8 percent in light of second quarter growth figures that exceeded expectations. The IMF nonetheless expects that there will be a certain slowdown in growth in the advanced economiesstarting in the second half of 2010 and continuing in the first half of 2011. The IMF forecasts 4.2 percent global growth in 2011, a slowdown compared with growth in 2010. Sizable capital inflows into the emerging markets boosted activity in the international foreign currency markets, with increased intervention in the markets both in the form of purchases of foreign currency by central banks and via the imposition of restrictions imposed on capital movements. Inflation remained at a low level in the advanced economies, mainly due to their output gaps. In the emerging markets, inflationary pressures strengthened, following the increase in commodity prices. Against the background of the persistent weakness of the leading advanced economies, the increased risk of further deterioration, and concern over deflation, investors' expectations of continued and even more extensive quantitative easing in those economies increased. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for November unchanged at 2 percent is consistent with the gradual process of returning the interest rate toa more 'normal' level intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to support the further recovery of economic activity, while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate is not pre-determined, but is set in accordance with the inflation environment, growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the leading central banks,and developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. At the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. Inflation in the last twelve months has been within the target range for about five months, and is expected to remain within it in the next few months. However, inflation expectations calculated from the capital market for one year ahead and those of the private forecasters remain close to the upper limit of the target inflation range, partly due to expectations that housing prices will continue to increase. The housing component of the CPI, which relates to rentals, continues to feature prominently as a factor contributingto the rise in the CPI. House prices, taken from the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices, continued to increase rapidly. From the financial stability aspect, the persistent increase in house prices and the growth in credit for house purchases, due in part to the low interest rate, necessitate the introduction of measures to counter these trends. Therefore, following steps taken previously by the Bank of Israel, the Supervisor ofBanks has issued a draft directive to the banks instructing them to increase their capital provision for housing loans at floating interest with highloan-to-value (LTV) ratios. These measures are expected to restrain the increase in house prices, and hence also gradually to moderate the increase in the housing component of the CPI. This month's economic data indicate some slowing of the rate of growth of output, mainly reflecting a fall in exports, with increased uncertainty regarding the sustainability of growth deriving from uncertainty about global demand. Interest rates of the leading advanced economies' central banks are low, and in light of the latest developments are expected to remain low for a long time, and some central banks are preparing to renew measures of quantitative easing.</td> In light of the Bank of Israel's decision to introduce a further macroprudential measure with regard to housing finance, and its implications for inflation, and in light of the indications of a slowdown in growth, the Governor decided to keep the rate of interest unchanged for November, at 2 percent. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic and financial developments, and will use the instruments available to itto achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the housing market, and specially on house prices. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on November 8, 2010. The decision regarding the interest rate for December 2010 will be published at 17:30 on Monday.

Poland,2010-10-27,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 27 October 2010 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 26-27 October 2010 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: (cid:131) reference rate at 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) discount rate at 4.00% on an annual basis. At the same time, the Council decided to increase the required reserve rate by 0.5 percentage points from 3.0% to 3.5%. This decision applies to the required reserve to be maintained from 31 December 2010. Modest recovery in the global economy has continued, and its pace in the second half of 2010 is likely to be lower than in the first half of the year. Economic growth in the developed countries is curbed by high unemployment and ongoing adjustments in the balance sheets of households, enterprises and financial institutions. The rapid growth in the major emerging economies has been decelerating slightly, which is driven by tightening of the economic policy in some of those countries aimed at limiting the risk of growing macroeconomic imbalance. The effects of high fiscal imbalance and its planned reduction in the developed economies, as well as the effects of monetary expansion, including non-standard measures undertaken and envisaged by major central banks continue to be an important uncertainty factor for the global economic growth. In the recent period expectations of increased scale of monetary expansion in the United States were accompanied by improved investors' sentiment in the financial markets. Both factors, on the one hand, supported the appreciation of currencies against the US dollar, including that of the zloty as well as of currencies of other emerging economies. On the other hand, they were also conducive to a rise in prices of some commodities in the world markets. The data on the Polish economy in 2010 Q3 signal slightly higher economic growth as compared to the previous quarter. Industrial output continues to grow rapidly. In the recent period the growth of construction and assembly output accelerated. Production capacity utilization has been steadily rising. Enterprises continue to have very good financial and liquidity situation. At the same time, despite improvement in current activity, in the majority of sectors expectations of enterprises about demand and output have deteriorated. Enterprises continue to increase employment, albeit the decline in the registered unemployment rate has halted (in seasonally adjusted terms). Rise in employment is supported by continued high wage discipline in enterprises. In 2010 Q3 wage growth declined in the corporate sector. Growing number of economically active persons may have a dampening effect on wage growth. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. Lending to enterprises remains limited, mainly due to reasons related to the demand for credit. Stable growth in mortgage loans to households continues. The share of foreign currency loans in the newly granted mortgage loans to households is on the rise again. In September 2010 the annual CPI inflation increased to the level of the NBP inflation target set at 2.5%. This rise in CPI inflation was mainly driven by an increase in the growth of food prices and  to a lesser degree  of energy prices. Core inflation net of food and energy has not changed. At the same time, other core inflation measures and PPI growth increased. The majority of inflation expectation measures are close to the NBP inflation target. In the coming months a further rise in CPI inflation may be expected, which shall be driven by growing food and energy prices. Moreover, in 2011 the level of prices may be slightly increased by the announced change in VAT rates. The Council has got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute of the NBP, which is one of the inputs into the Council's decision-making on the NBP interest rates. In line with the October projection  under the assumption of constant NBP interest rates  there is a 50-percent probability of inflation running in the range of 2.4-2.6% in 2010 (as compared to 2.3-2.9% in the June projection), 2.5-3.5% in 2011 (as compared to 2.1-3.3%) and 2.4- 3.7% in 2012 (as compared to 2.2-3.7%). In turn, the October projection sees the annual GDP growth with a 50-percent probability in the range of 3.3-3.7% in 2010 (as compared to 2.5-3.9% in the June projection), 3.3-5.5% in 2011 (as compared to 3.3-5.9%) and 2.8-5.5% in 2012 (as compared to 2.2-5.0%). In the Council's assessment, the currently limited inflationary and wage pressure in the Polish economy and  not accounted for in the baseline scenario of the October inflation and GDP projection  the possibility of growing capital inflows to the emerging economies, including to Poland, amidst the extended period of expansionary monetary policy of major central banks, combined with the risk of further weakening of the global economic growth justify keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged. At the same time, the Council will continue to analyse the signs of possible rise in inflationary pressure. The Council decided to increase the required reserve rate by 0.5 percentage points from 3.0% to 3.5%. As a result of this decision the required reserve rate will return to the level effective before 30 June 2009. An important factor affecting the monetary policy is the situation of public finance. Introducing decisive measures aimed at permanently reducing the deficit of the general government sector and at curbing the increase of the public debt is necessary for macroeconomic stability and will allow the meeting of euro adoption criteria. In the opinion of the Council, introducing measures aimed at preventing fast growth in foreign currency lending to households is important for macroeconomic stability. Such measures can also contribute to increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission mechanism. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the ERM II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organisational conditions. The Council has adopted the Inflation Report  October 2010, the Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland for 2010 Q2 and the Opinion of the Monetary Policy Council on the Draft Budget Act for 2011."
India,2010-11-02,"Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2010-11 Press Statement by Dr.D. Subbarao. Governor ""This morning, the Reserve Bank released its Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2010-11. At the heart of the policy was a further increase in the repo and reverse repo rates by 25 basis points each. Accordingly, the repo rate stands raised to 6.25 per cent and the reverse repo rate to 5.25 per cent. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) has been left unchanged at 6 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of banks. With this increase, since we started reversing the monetary policy stance in March 2010, the repo rate has increased by 150 basis points and the reverse repo by 200 basis points. Considerations Behind Policy Move 3. As always, we had taken into account both global and domestic macroeconomic situation in calibrating this policy move. In particular, we were guided by three considerations. i) Domestic growth drivers are robust which should help absorb to a large extent the negative impact of any slowdown in global recovery. ii) Inflation and inflationary expectations remain high as both demand side and supply side factors are at play. Given the spread and persistence of inflation, demand-side inflationary pressures need to be contained and inflationary expectations anchored. iii) Even though a liquidity deficit is consistent with our anti-inflation stance, it needs to be contained within a reasonable limit to ensure that economic activity is not disrupted. Global Outlook 4. To start with, a brief comment on the global economy. The fragile and uneven nature of the recovery and large unemployment in advanced economies raise concerns about the sustainability of the global turn around. The slowing momentum of recovery has prompted the central banks of some advanced economies to initiate (or consider initiating) a second round of quantitative easing to further stimulate private demand. While the ultra loose monetary policy of advanced economies may benefit the global economy in the medium-term, in the short-term it will trigger further capital inflows into emerging market economies (EMEs) and put upward pressure on global commodity prices. Indian Economy2 Growth 5. Turning to domestic outlook, the economy is operating close to the trend growth rate, driven mainly by domestic factors. The normal South-West monsoon and its delayed withdrawal have boosted the prospects of both kharif and rabi agricultural production which should also stimulate rural demand. Most industrial and service sector indicators also point towards sustained growth. Taking into account the good performance of the agriculture sector, and a range of indicators of industrial production and service sector activity, the baseline projection of real GDP growth for 2010-11, for policy purposes, is retained at 8.5 per cent. Inflation 7. Let me now move to the vital issue of inflation conditions. Notwithstanding some moderation in recent months, headline inflation remains significantly above its medium- term trend, and well above the comfort zone of the Reserve Bank. Food inflation has not shown the expected post-monsoon moderation and has remained persistently elevated for over an year now, reflecting in part the structural demand-supply mismatches in several commodities. This has elevated inflation expectations. The risks of expectations spilling over into prices of other commodities are significant when the economy is growing close to trend. That could potentially offset the recent moderation. Even as non-food manufacturing inflation has moderated, it remains above its medium-term trend. The new WPI series released in September 2010 is a better representative of commodity price levels with an updated base (2004-05=100) and wider coverage of commodities. When we compare the old and new WPI series, inflation at the aggregate level over the medium-term is similar under both series, but there are differences at a disaggregated level. Inflation in primary articles, especially food articles, in the new series has been significantly higher than in the old series, whereas for manufactured products, it has been somewhat lower. Going forward, the inflation outlook will be shaped by three factors: the evolution of food price inflation; global commodity prices; and demand pressures stemming from sustained growth amidst tightening capacity constraints in many industries. On balance, inflation is expected to moderate from the present elevated level, reflecting in part, some easing of supply constraints and concerted policy action. In its July Review, the Reserve Bank made a baseline projection of WPI inflation for March 2011 of 6 per cent under the old series of WPI. The baseline projection of WPI inflation for March 2011 has been placed at 5.5 per cent under the new series. This is equivalent to 6 per cent under the old series. Effectively, this means that the Reserve Bank's inflation projection remains unchanged from that made in its July 2010 Review. Monetary and Liquidity Aggregates 11. The overall liquidity situation has been in the news over the last few weeks. Let me explain the evolving situation and the underlying dynamics. The present tight liquidity is a result of both structural and frictional factors. On the structural side, the deposit growth rate of the banking system has been sluggish even as the credit growth improved. On the frictional side, government cash balances had built up as a result of more than anticipated tax receipts. On top of it, there were large capital outflows on account of refund of over-subscription of Coal India IPO. Tight liquidity conditions are admittedly desirable from the viewpoint of inflation management, but there are legitimate concerns about the deficit as the injection through the LAF window had become too large in recent weeks, in excess of the Reserve Bank's comfort zone of (+/-) 1 per cent of NDTL3 14. With a view to alleviating the frictional liquidity pressure, the Reserve Bank decided to conduct a second LAF (SLAF) on a daily basis and also allowed banks to avail additional liquidity support under the LAF to the extent of up to 1 per cent of their NDTL up to November 4, 2010. In order to address the structural liquidity problem, earlier today, the Reserve Bank announced an OMO for purchase of government securities amounting to 12,000 crore. In view of the current assessment of the growth-inflation dynamics. It is expected that monetary aggregates will evolve along the projected trajectory indicated in our July Review. Accordingly, for policy purposes, we have retained the earlier projections of money supply (M ) at 17 per cent and of non-food bank credit growth at 20 per cent. As 3 always, these numbers are indicative projections and not targets. External Sector 16. Let me now move to external sector management which has assumed a lot of importance in the recent period owing to global developments. The current account deficit in the balance of payments widened in the first quarter of 2010-11. If the current trend persists, the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP for the full year will be significantly higher than in last year. It is generally perceived that a current account deficit above 3 per cent of GDP is difficult to sustain over the medium-term. The challenge, therefore, is to rein in the deficit over the medium-term and finance it in the short-term. The medium-term task has to receive policy focus from both the Government and the Reserve Bank. The short term task is to see that the current account is fully financed while ensuring that capital flows are not far out of line with the economy's absorptive capacity and that the component of long-term and stable flows in the overall capital flows is high. Capital Flows 17. In the context of today's increases in policy rates, let me now turn to another important issue. It has often been argued that the widening of interest rate differential between the domestic and international markets will result in increased debt-creating capital flows. While it is true that large interest rate differential makes investment in domestic debt instruments and external borrowings by domestic entities more attractive, we need to keep in view three aspects in the Indian context. First, the economy's capacity to absorb capital flows has expanded as reflected in the widening of the current account deficit. Second, despite the already large differential between domestic and international interest rates, capital flows in the recent period have been predominantly in the form of portfolio flows into the equity market. This suggests that the interest rate differential is not the only factor that influences capital flows. Third, in line with our policy of preferring equity to debt-creating flows, we still maintain some controls in respect of debt flows. Risk Factors 18. Let me indicate some of the important risks to the growth and inflation outlook. First, the main downside risk to growth emanates from the prospects of a prolonged, slow and halting recovery in advanced economies which would adversely affect the growth performance of EMEs, including India. Second, inflationary pressures may accentuate due to the structural component in food inflation while demand side pressures may accentuate due to capacity constraints in many industries and rising global commodity prices. Third, given the weak recovery, some advanced economies are in the process of resorting to another round of quantitative easing that could trigger capital flows into EMEs, including India. Large capital flows beyond the absorptive capacity of4 the economy could pose a major challenge for exchange rate and monetary management. Fourth, the widening of the current account deficit raises concerns given the uncertainty associated with international capital flows. Fifth, asset prices in India, as in many other EMEs, have risen sharply in a short time which is a cause for concern. Monetary Policy Stance 19. The current stance of monetary policy is intended to: Contain inflation and anchor inflationary expectations, while being prepared to respond to any further build-up of inflationary pressures. Maintain an interest rate regime consistent with price, output and financial stability. Actively manage liquidity to ensure that it remains broadly in balance, with neither a surplus diluting monetary transmission nor a deficit choking off fund flows. Expected Outcomes 20. Today's monetary policy actions are expected to: Sustain the anti-inflationary thrust of recent monetary actions and outcomes in the face of persistent inflation risks. Rein in rising inflationary expectations which may be aggravated by the structural nature of food price increases. Be moderate enough not to disrupt growth. Let me reiterate that the exit from expansionary monetary policy since October 2009 has been calibrated on the basis of India's specific growth-inflation dynamics in the broader context of persistent global uncertainty. The Reserve Bank will continue to closely monitor both global and domestic macroeconomic conditions. We will take action as warranted with a view to mitigating any potentially disruptive effects of lumpy and volatile capital flows and sharp movements in domestic liquidity conditions, consistent with the broad objectives of price and output stability. Based purely on current growth and inflation trends, the Reserve Bank believes that the likelihood of further rate actions in the immediate future is relatively low. However, in an uncertain world, we need to be prepared to respond appropriately to shocks that may emanate from either global or domestic environment. Developmental and Regulatory Polices 23. Let me now turn to developmental and regulatory issues. The thrust of the regulation by the Reserve Bank in recent years has not only been on strengthening the financial system, but also on developing financial markets, promoting financial inclusion, improving credit delivery, especially to the SME sector, improving customer service and strengthening the payment and settlement systems. The Reserve Bank, therefore, will continue to pursue reforms in these areas so as to enhance the efficiency and stability of the financial system. I will highlight a few measures, we have taken or plan to take in these areas. Financial Stability Releasing the second financial stability report in December 2010. Going forward, financial stability report will be published in June and December every year.5 Interest Rates Preparing a discussion paper, which will delineate the pros and cons of deregulating the savings bank deposits interest rate. Financial Market Products Permitting settlement of repo in corporate bonds on a T+0 basis in addition to the existing T+1 and T+2 basis. Credit Delivery and Financial Inclusion Allowing regional rural banks (RRBs) to open branches in tier 3 to tier 6 centres as identified in the Census 2001(with population up to 49,999), subject to fulfilling certain conditions. Opening sub-offices of the Reserve Bank in the remaining six states of the North East, viz. Arunachal Pradesh. Nagaland. Manipur. Mizoram. Tripura and Meghalaya, in a phased manner. Initiating several measures to strengthen the role of urban co-operation banks (UCBs) such as: extending area of their operations; liberalising branch licensing policy for well managed and financially sound UCBs; allowing well managed and financially sound UCBs to engage business correspondents (BCs)/business facilitators (BFs); allowing licensed UCBs the facility of INFINET membership, current and SGL accounts with the Reserve Bank; and allowing RTGS membership to well managed and financially sound UCBs having a minimum net worth of 25 crore. Regulatory Measures Prescribing the loan to value (LTV) ratio of not exceeding 80 per cent in respect of housing loans hereafter. Increasing the risk weight for residential housing loans of 75 lakh and above, irrespective of the LTV, to 125 per cent. Increase the standard asset provisioning by commercial banks for all housing loans with teaser rates to 2 per cent. Stipulating prudential limits to regulate the investments of banks in companies engaged in forms of business other than financial services. Banks will be required to review their investments in such companies and be compliant with the guidelines as per the roadmap to be laid down. Implementing the recommendations of the Internal Group on Supervision of Financial Conglomerates (FCs) on capital adequacy for FCs; and intra- group transactions and exposures in FCs. Taking appropriate steps to fully align the corporate governance practices in banks in India with the principles enunciated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). Issuing final guidelines on compensation practices by banks by end-December 2010. Putting the draft guidelines on licensing of new banks in public domain by end- January 2011 for public comments. Institutional Measures6 Increasing the threshold limit for real time gross settlement system (RTGS) transactions from the present limit of 1 lakh to 2 lakh. Accepting the report of the Group on next generation RTGS. Planning the next roll out of cheque truncation system in March 2011 at Chennai. Discussions with banks 25. Banks welcomed the Reserve Bank's policy stance. They agreed that the monetary measures announced by the Reserve Bank today were appropriate in the current domestic growth-inflation dynamics. Apart from monetary measures, discussions with banks focused on four specific issues, i.e., liquidity situation; housing credit, price and risk; customer service; and external sector management. While appreciating the liquidity easing measurers announced recently, banks indicated that steps are required to ease structural liquidity. Welcoming the stipulation of the loan to value ratio and increased risk weight in housing loans, some banks felt that the practice of offering lower interest rates in the initial period of housing loans cannot be equated with teaser loans as the risk in such loans is not different from those offered at floating rate loans. Banks reiterated that they will continue to strive for improved customer service. Banks shared the Reserve Bank's concern that the component of stable capital flows in the overall flows should be increased to address the concerns of financing the widening current account deficit."" Ajit Prasad Press Release : 2010-2011/615 Assistant General Manager."
Romania,2010-11-02,"In its meeting of November 2, 2010, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. At the same time, the NBR Board decided to maintain the 2012 inflation target at 3 percent ±1 percentage point, and to adopt, as from 2013, a flat multi-annual inflation target of 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point. The assumed targets will be discussed with the government. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for November 4, 2010. The annual inflation rate went up to 7.77 percent in September 2010 from 7.58 percent the previous month amid a gradual pass-through of the first-round effect of the hike in the standard value added tax rate on 1 July 2010, as well as the unfavourable influences on agri-food product prices of developments on specific domestic and external markets. At the same time, annual adjusted CORE21 inflation stood at 4.7 percent in September 2010, marginally above the previous month's level, as the magnitude and the persistence of the aggregate demand deficit offset the adverse impact from the higher VAT rate on the majority of consumer prices included in this basket. Nevertheless, concerns remain over the possible second-round effects of the VAT rate hike, a potential higher-than-anticipated adjustment in administered prices compared to that envisaged when the forecast was prepared, and uncertainties related to the impact of fiscal consolidation measures given the tense political and social climate, thus requiring a continued prudent monetary policy stance. In this context, the NBR Board decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 6.25 percent per annum and to pursue an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system. At the same time, the NBR Board has decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. These decisions are aimed at firmly anchoring inflation expectations in a bid to consolidate prospects to resume disinflation given the persistent uncertainties surrounding domestic developments and the recovery of the global economy. The NBR Board reaffirms that the return of inflation to a downward path and the emergence of sustainable economic recovery decisively hinge, within a coherent macroeconomic policy mix, on the firm and consistent implementation of fiscal consolidation measures, as well as of structural reforms along with the increase in European funds absorption, in line with commitments set under the multilateral external financing arrangement with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions. This is an essential prerequisite for regaining confidence of international financial markets. Following the assessment of the new projections and of the related risks and uncertainties, mainly those arising from factors beyond the control of monetary policy, which have also arisen from the implementation of the necessary fiscal consolidation, the NBR decided to maintain the 2012 inflation target at 3 percent ±1 percentage point. Moreover, the NBR Board decided that the central bank should adopt, as from 2013, a flat multi-annual inflation target of 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point. The shift towards a flat multi-annual inflation target is a beneficial, albeit ambitious, adjustment of the inflation targeting framework that implies a long-term commitment of monetary policy to an objective in line with the definition of medium-term price stability in the Romanian economy. It is meant to ensure the decline in inflation rates to a level compatible with the inflation criterion in the Maastricht Treaty and the ultimate shift to the continuous long-term inflation target, in line with the ECB's quantitative definition of price stability, without hampering the relative price changes triggered by structural adjustments of the Romanian economy. The NBR Board has also examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses the recent macroeconomic environment and the inflation outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The Report will be presented to the public in a news conference scheduled for November 4, 2010. The NBR Board reaffirms that the NBR will continue to vigilantly monitor domestic and global economic developments so as to ensure, by using its available instruments, the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for January 5, 2011. 1) Calculated by the NBR by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index."
United States,2010-11-03,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September confirms that the pace of recovery in output and employment continues to be slow. Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising, though less rapidly than earlier in the year, while investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak. Employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Housing starts continue to be depressed. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, but measures of underlying inflation have trended lower in recent quarters. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. Currently, the unemployment rate is elevated, and measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low, relative to levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate. Although the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, progress toward its objectives has been disappointingly slow. To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to expand its holdings of securities. The Committee will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings. In addition, the Committee intends to purchase a further $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011, a pace of about $75 billion per month. The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming information and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to support the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A Duke; Sandra Pianalto; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S Rosengren; Daniel K Tarullo; Kevin M Warsh; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the policy was Thomas M Hoenig. Mr. Hoenig believed the risks of additional securities purchases outweighed the benefits. Mr. Hoenig also was concerned that this continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future financial imbalances and, over time, would cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations that could destabilize the economy.

Czech Republic,2010-11-04,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 7th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 4 November 2010 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Bank Board decided by a majority vote to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.75%. Five board members voted in favour of this decision and one member voted for increasing rates by 0.25 percentage point. Reasons for the decision Headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates close to their current levels initially, followed by a gradual rise in rates at the longer end of the forecast. The message of the forecast Headline inflation is currently close to the inflation target and will remain at this level in the next two years. Monetary-policy relevant inflation will continuously grow over the forecast horizon and will be approaching the target in mid 2011. This year the economy has recovered from the recession, but the economic growth will slow down next year due mainly to fiscal restriction and reappearance of more robust economic recovery can be expected in 2012. The nominal exchange rate is gradually appreciating over the forecast horizon. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates close to their current levels initially, followed by a gradual rise in rates at the longer end of the forecast. Mild risk on the up side: higher world commodity and domestic agricultural producer prices Mild risk on the down side: higher-than-expected anti-inflationary effects of fiscal consolidation in the world 13 Thank you for your attention More information about the forecast can be found at and in Inflation Report IV/2010, to be published 12 November 2010."
Euroarea,2010-11-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council continues to view the current key ECB interest rates as appropriate. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 7 October 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Recent economic data are consistent with our assessment that the underlying momentum of the recovery remains positive. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained. We expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Overall, the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. The stance, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are fully consistent with our mandate and, by construction, temporary in nature. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Recent data releases and survey evidence generally confirm our view that the positive underlying momentum of the economic recovery in the euro area remains in place. In line with previous expectations, this implies ongoing real GDP growth in the second half of this year. The global recovery is expected to proceed, and this should imply a continued positive impact on the demand for euro area exports. At the same time, private sector domestic demand should contribute to growth, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are still slightly tilted to the downside, with uncertainty prevailing. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. On the other hand, some concerns remain relating to the re-emergence of tensions in financial markets. In addition, downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, protectionist pressures, and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, as anticipated, euro area annual HICP inflation rose to 1.9% in October, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, compared with 1.8% in September. In the next few months HICP inflation rates will hover around current levels before moderating again in the course of next year. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the outlook for price developments are slightly tilted to the upside. They relate, in particular, to the evolution of energy and non-oil commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are still expected to be contained. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 was broadly unchanged, at 1.0% in September 2010, after 1.1% in August. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, at 1.2%, remained unchanged from August. Looking beyond developments in individual months, broad money and loan growth remains low and continues to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. The annual growth rate of M1 has continued to moderate, standing at 5.9% in September 2010, while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits has become less negative. This reflects the widening spread between interest rates paid on short-term time deposits and those paid on overnight deposits. The annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector is increasingly supported by the flow of loans to non-financial corporations. The annual growth rate of these loans is still slightly negative, but developments in recent months suggest that a turning point was reached earlier in 2010. This would be consistent with the lagged response of loan developments to economic activity over the business cycle that was also observed in past cycles. The annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 2.8% in September and thereby remained at levels seen in previous months. Banks have continued to gradually increase the weight of credit to the private sector in the overall size of their balance sheets, but the challenge remains to expand the availability of such credit when demand picks up further. Where necessary, to address this challenge, banks should retain earnings, turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 7 October 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Recent economic data are consistent with our assessment that the underlying momentum of the recovery remains positive. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained. We expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations remains of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, there is a clear need to strengthen public confidence in the capacity of governments to return to sustainable public finances, reduce risk premia in interest rates and thus support sustainable growth over the medium term. To this end, it is essential that countries pursue credible multi-year consolidation plans and fully implement the planned consolidation measures. In their 2011 budgets, they need to specify credible fiscal adjustment measures, focusing on the expenditure side. Any positive fiscal developments that may emerge, reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected environment, should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation. The urgent implementation of far-reaching structural reforms is essential to enhance the prospects for higher sustainable growth. Major reforms are particularly necessary in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. The removal of labour market rigidities and the strengthening of productivity growth would further support the adjustment process of these economies. Increasing product market competition, particularly in the services sectors, would also facilitate the restructuring of the economy and encourage innovation and the adoption of new technologies. At their meeting on 28-29 October 2010 the EU Heads of State and Government agreed on the reform of the European Union's economic governance. The proposals put forward by President Van Rompuy represent a strengthening of the existing framework for fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance in the European Union. However, the Governing Council considers that they do not go as far as the quantum leap in the economic governance of Monetary Union that it has been calling for. In particular, the Governing Council is concerned that there would be insufficient automaticity in the implementation of fiscal surveillance, that there is no specification of the rule to reduce the government debt ratio, and that financial sanctions have not been explicitly retained under the macroeconomic surveillance procedure. With regard to the macroeconomic surveillance procedure in particular, the new system of mutual surveillance would need to concentrate firmly on euro area countries experiencing sustained losses of competitiveness and large current account deficits. It should be determined by transparent and effective trigger mechanisms. It would be essential that the assessments of macroeconomic imbalances and recommendations for corrective action be given broad publicity at all stages of the surveillance process. The public and the markets can be confident that the Governing Council remains firmly committed to delivering on its mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term."
Egypt,2010-11-04,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release November 4, 2010 In its meeting held on November 4, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 825 percent and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 85 percen. Headline CPI increased by 169 percent in September after accelerating by 285 percent in August, while the annual rate remained broadly unchanged at 1097 percent in Septembe. The intensification of supply shortages related to fruits & vegetables in addition to red meat and poultry have led to a surge in their prices to account for more than 60 percent of annual headline inflation between July and Septembe. On the other hand, after jumping by 282 percent in August, core CPI inched up by 022 percent in September, while the annual rate declined to 759 percent from 816 percent in Augus. The acceleration in the prices of red meat and poultry have accounted for 60 percent of annual core inflation between July and Septembe. Meanwhile the annual real GDP growth for 2009/10 Q4 was revised downwards from 59 percent to 54 percen. Looking ahead, unfolding global economic developments have created uncertainty about the nascent global recovery, which could potentially weigh on domestic investment and external deman. Against the above and despite the sharp increase in food prices, non-food inflation has remained largely subdued since early 2009, implying that underlying inflation pressures arising from the ongoing economic recovery remain containe. Nonetheless the MPC is mindful of the risk of possible propagation of shocks related to food items to other price. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Division Chief.

Turkiye,2010-11-11,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) was kept constant at 7 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate was reduced from 5.75 percent to 1.75 percent, while lending rate was kept constant at 8.75 percent. The interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions was kept constant at 7.75 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate was reduced from 1.75 percent to 0 percent, while lending rate was kept at 11.75 percent. Recent data releases suggest that economic activity continues to recover with the support of domestic demand. However, it would take a long time before industrial capacity utilization rates return to their pre-crisis levels, due to weak external demand outlook. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates remain at high levels. Therefore, it is expected that inflation would be on a declining path in the forthcoming period, while core inflation indicators would remain consistent with the medium-term targets. In light of these assessments, the Committee has reiterated that it would be necessary to maintain the policy rate at current levels for some time, and to keep it at low levels for a long period. Recent surge in capital inflows exacerbates the divergence between the growth rates of domestic and external demand, widening the current account deficit through rapid credit growth and increasing import demand and thus highlighting the risks regarding financial stability. In order to encourage the lengthening of the maturities in the Turkish lira money market transactions, the Committee has decided to allow overnight interest rates to diverge from the policy rate temporarily, when needed. To this end, the Committee has decided to widen the gap between lending and borrowing rates by reducing the borrowing rates by 400 basis points. Moreover, observing the favorable developments in credit conditions, the Committee has indicated that it would be appropriate to proceed with the remaining measures outlined in the exit strategy. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Malaysia,2010-11-12,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 2.75 percent. Growth in the global economy has moderated in the third quarter, with a sustained divergence in the growth performance of the advanced and emerging economies. In the region, the recovery continues, although the pace of economic growth has moderated arising from a weakening of external demand. International financial market conditions have become more volatile with increased capital flows to emerging markets. This shift in global liquidity has brought with it risks to macroeconomic and financial stability in the emerging market economies. In the Malaysian economy, recent indicators on exports and external-related sectors affirmed the earlier expectations for growth to moderate in the third quarter. Nevertheless, domestic demand has provided strong support to growth. Going forward, overall growth will continue to be well supported by domestic economic activity. Private consumption will benefit from the favourable employment conditions, firm commodity prices and accommodative financing environment, while the expansion in private investment is expected to be driven by increased capital spending in the domestic-oriented sectors. Domestic headline inflation moderated in September to 1.8%. Prices are expected to rise at a modest pace in the coming months in view of the rising global commodity and food prices. Inflation is however expected to remain moderate going into 2011. The MPC considers the current level of OPR as appropriate and consistent with the latest assessment of the economic growth and inflation prospects. The stance of monetary policy continues to remain accommodative and supportive of economic growth. While domestic financial conditions remain orderly, greater vigilance will be accorded to the potential risks arising from large and volatile capital flows. The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2011. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times a year. The Monetary Policy Statement will be released at 6 p.m. on the same day as the MPC meeting. Bank Negara Malaysia 12 November 2010."
Peru,2010-11-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR NOVEMBER 2010 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 3.0 percent. This decision takes into account the recent evolution of inflation and its determinants, which advises to continue with the pause made in implementing the preventive adjustments of the reference rate initiated in May of this year. Core inflation remains around the 2 percent target, while total inflation has been declining in the last two months due to the reversal of supply shocks. Future adjustments in the reference rate will depend on new information on the evolution of inflation and its determinants, as well as on the evolution of the international financial environment. Inflation in October was negative for a second consecutive month (-0.14 percent), mainly as a result of the decline of food prices. With this, annual inflation recorded 2.10 percent. Core inflation, which showed a rate of 0.17 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 2.07 percent and remains around the 2 percent target. Inflation without considering food and energy rose from 1.12 percent in September to 1.31 percent in October. Inflation expectations remain anchored within the tolerance range. Indicators of economic activity show a strong dynamism. Thus, for example, the production of electricity has increased 9.6 percent. On the other hand, indicators of global economic activity confirm projections of a more moderate growth in the following quarters. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 3.80 percent. Overnight deposits: 2.20 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.80 percent The Board will approve the Monetary Program for December on December 9, 2010."
Chile,2010-11-16,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 16 November 2010 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.0% (annual). Internationally, signs of moderate growth in developed countries have continued, which contrasts with the dynamism of emerging economies. In the past few weeks, concerns regarding risk in some European economies have intensified, increasing financial volatility. The slow recovery of developed countries is still an important risk factor for emerging economies. In addition, inflation in emerging economies has increased and measures have been adopted to reduce the monetary stimulus in some Asian countries. Domestically, output and demand figures show strong economic growth, in line with the projections in September's Monetary Policy Report. Inflation has proceeded slightly below expectations, reflecting lower inflation of tradable goods, while private expectations continue to be aligned around 3% over the relevant monetary policy horizon. With respect to the dollar, the peso remains fairly unchanged since the last meeting. The Board will continue to reduce the current monetary policy stimulus at a pace that will depend on the unfolding of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions. Accordingly, the Board reiterates that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2010-11-16,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate from 2.25% of its current level to 2.50%. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate from 2.25% of its current level to 2.50%. In the global economy, emerging market economies have sustained their favorable performance, and the economies of major advanced countries have largely continued their moderate recovery trend. Looking ahead, the possibility of the heightened volatility of economic activity and exchange rates in major countries acting as a risk factor for the global economy cannot be ruled out. The underlying upward trend of domestic business activity has been maintained. Even though facilities investment has faltered, exports have sustained their buoyancy and consumption has increased. And, led by the private sector, labor market conditions have shown an improving trend. The domestic economy is expected to continue on an underlying upward track, even in the presence of external risk. Consumer price inflation has increased further driven mainly by farm product prices. Going forwards, inflation is expected to decrease somewhat due to the renewed stability of vegetable prices, however, upward pressures are expected to continue, being associated with the continued upswing in activity and the run-up in international raw material prices. In the real estate market, the scale of the decrease in housing sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas has narrowed, with the upward trend of housing sales prices in other areas being maintained. In the financial markets, amid continued inflows of foreign portfolio investment funds, stock prices have risen, the Korean won has appreciated, and in response chiefly to the high inflation rates, long term market interest rates have rebounded from their deep decline. Mortgage lending has continued to increase on a relatively large scale, even though house transactions have been inactive. Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy in such a way as to help the economy maintain price stability, while sustaining sound growth. In carrying out policy, it will take overall account of financial and economic conditions at home and abroad."
Philippines,2010-11-17,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. The BSP's policy rates have been kept steady since July 2009. The Monetary Board's decision was based on its assessment that inflation remains manageable given favorable economic conditions. Latest baseline forecasts show inflation firmly anchored well within the target of 3.5 to 5.5 percent for 2010 and broadly consistent with the target of 3.0 to 5.0 percent for both 2011 and 2012. Economic growth is proceeding at a robust pace, underpinned by strong domestic demand. Domestic liquidity remains adequate to support economic activity given the steady uptrend in bank lending and continued improvements in domestic financial markets. The Monetary Board thus believes that there is a sound policy balance that is supportive of both inflation control and economic expansion. Risks to the inflation outlook appear to be finely balanced between potential upside and downside pressures. Nonetheless, the Monetary Board will continue to monitor the volatility of global commodity prices and the possibility that existing stimulus measures and quantitative easing programs in advanced economies could generate inflationary pressures over the medium term. The Monetary Board also noted that the recent run-up in asset prices, driven in part by strong foreign capital inflows, does not appear to pose an immediate threat to financial stability, although it continues to warrant careful attention. Going forward, the BSP will continue to closely monitor developments that can impact on price stability to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains appropriate and supportive of non-inflationary economic growth."
South Africa,2010-11-18,"The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas declined to 3,2 per cent in September 2010, compared with 3,5 per cent in August. Goods price inflation measured 1,5 per cent in September, while services inflation amounted to 5,2 per cent. The categories of housing and utilities (mainly electricity) and miscellaneous goods and services (predominantly insurance costs) together contributed 2,2 percentage points of the 3,2 per cent inflation outcome. CPI excluding administered prices measured 2,6 per cent, while administered prices excluding petrol measured 9 per cent. Of the 12 broad CPI categories, only one category had an inflation rate that was within the target range of 3 to 6 per cent, while the inflation rates of six categories were below the lower end of the target range. Five categories, with a combined weighting of 34,6 per cent, had inflation rates above the 6 per cent level. Having peaked at 9,4 per cent in June 2010, producer price inflation has since moderated somewhat and measured 6,8 per cent in September. Despite higher global food price trends, agricultural prices as well as manufactured food prices continued to decline on a year-on-year basis. This indicates subdued pressure on food prices in the coming months at the consumer level, where food prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 1,2 per cent. The lower-than-expected inflation outcomes contributed to a further downward adjustment in the inflation forecast of the Bank throughout the forecast period to the end of 2012. Targeted CPI inflation averaged 3,5 per cent in the third quarter of 2010. A similar average outcome is expected during the fourth quarter, resulting in an expected average inflation rate of 4,3 per cent for 2010. Inflation is then expected to remain at an average of 4,3 per cent in 2011 and to increase to 4,8 per cent in 2012. In the final quarter of 2012 inflation is expected to average 4,8 per cent, compared with the previous forecast of 5,1 per cent. The more favourable forecast is a result of an expected moderation in administered price inflation, a more appreciated nominal effective exchange rate of the rand, as well as lower-than-expected actual inflation outcomes which lowered the starting point of the forecast. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at Stellenbosch University during the third quarter have been revised downwards for all categories of respondents. Expectations have been on a consistent downward trend since reaching a peak in the second quarter of 2009. Nevertheless, in contrast to expectations of the financial analysts, who expect inflation to remain within the target range over the forecast period, the expectations of trade unions and business executives remain outside the target range. According to this survey, inflation is expected to average 5,7 per cent in 2010, and 6,1 per cent and 6,4 per cent in 2011 and 2012 respectively. The Reuters consensus survey of financial analysts, conducted in October, also shows a more favourable outlook with inflation expected to average 5,5 per cent in 2012. Break-even inflation rates as derived from the inflation-linked bonds have also declined significantly across all maturities, to levels of around 5 per cent. The global economic recovery has continued in an uneven manner, with downside risks to the growth outlook in a number of the advanced economies including the US. Japan and the euro area. Further fiscal stimulus in the United States appears unlikely, suggesting that the burden of supporting the flagging growth and persistent unemployment will fall disproportionately on monetary policy. The recent resumption of quantitative easing, against a backdrop of deflation fears, indicates that monetary policy in the US is likely to remain highly expansionary for some time. There is heightened uncertainty in the euro area with the focus once again shifting to the peripheral countries, as concerns relating to the solvency of the Irish banking system and the sustainability of Irish public sector deficits have raised fears of possible contagion within Europe and possibly to the global financial sector. Spreads on sovereign debt have widened again in some of the Southern European countries after a relatively steady period, and in some instances have exceeded the levels reached in April 2010, when sovereign debt concerns reached their peak. Apart from the risks to the fragile global recovery, there are also significant risks to financial stability emanating from these developments in the advanced economies. Should the problems in the euro area not be resolved in an orderly manner, there are risks of a sudden reversal of capital flows to emerging markets. By contrast, growth in the emerging markets has remained buoyant, and in some instances monetary policy has been tightened in response to increased demand pressures. Furthermore, the strong growth in Asia, and China in particular, has underpinned commodity prices, which have contributed to the stronger trend in inflation in these countries. It is still unclear the extent to which growth in the emerging markets can be sustained independently of a recovery in the industrialised economies. Despite the higher commodity prices, global inflationary pressures remain relatively benign. The quantitative easing has continued to have spillover effects on emerging market economies. The search for yield resulting from this increase in liquidity has implications for the exchange rates of the recipient countries. South Africa has been no exception in this respect and appreciation pressures are expected to persist for some time, in the absence of renewed bouts of global risk aversion. The exchange rate therefore remains a downside risk to the inflation outlook. Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the rand has appreciated by over 3 per cent against the US dollar and is more or less unchanged on a trade-weighted basis. This has been despite lower domestic interest rates and the higher pace of reserve accumulation in the past two months. In October, the Bank acquired the proceeds of the foreign purchase of Didata which were in excess of US$ 2 billion. The recent observed volatility in the bilateral rand exchange rates has been mainly as a result of the volatility in the euro/dollar exchange rate. From a policy perspective, focus is maintained on the trade-weighted exchange rate. The domestic growth outlook remains subdued and below-trend growth is expected to persist. The forecast of the Bank is relatively unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC, with GDP growth remaining at 2,8 per cent for 2010 and expected to average 3,3 per cent and 3,6 per cent in 2011 and 2012 respectively. The composite leading business cycle indicator of the Bank has been trending sideways since April, suggesting a possible moderation in the pace of recovery in the months ahead. Private sector gross fixed capital formation is expected to have remained weak in the third quarter of 2010. The manufacturing sector, in particular the motor vehicle and components sector, was hit particularly hard by industrial action which contributed to the contraction of manufacturing output in the sector in the third quarter. Year-on-year growth in manufacturing sector output in September measured 1,4 per cent, much lower than market expectations, while output contracted by 1,5 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis in the third quarter. This was consistent with the declining manufacturing capacity utilisation in the third quarter, as well as the weakening Kagiso Purchasing Managers Index, which has returned to below the neutral level of 50. The construction and civil engineering sectors are also facing a challenging outlook. By contrast, output growth in the mining sector improved markedly in the third quarter and contributed positively to third quarter GDP growth. The RMB/BER business confidence index has been increasing, but still reflects negative sentiment overall. As a result of these trends, unemployment in the economy has shown little sign of reversing. There are indications of recovery in household consumption expenditure in the economy. Retail trade sales decreased by 1,4 per cent on a month-on-month basis in August, but increased by 0,4 per cent in September. On a year-on-year basis, the increase was 6,1 per cent. Although vehicle sales have grown significantly on a year-on-year basis, the short-term trends have moderated somewhat but were likely to have been impacted by the industrial action in this sector. Consumer confidence, as reflected in the FNB/BER consumer confidence index remains relatively high, but was largely unchanged during 2010. Household consumption expenditure is expected to be supported by positive wealth effects as reflected in higher asset prices and lower interest rates, but constrained by high unemployment and significant household debt levels. Growth in total loans and advances to the private sector by banks has continued to increase at a moderate pace, having increased by 4,1 per cent in September. This figure was somewhat inflated by technical factors such as the acquisition of mortgage loan books and a general loan book by banks from non-banks in the past three months. Mortgage advances were again the main contributors to the positive trend, increasing by 4,8 per cent on a year-on-year basis in both August and September. Growth in instalment sale credit and leasing finance turned marginally positive after 17 consecutive months of contraction, while other loans and advances accelerated to a year-on-year growth of 4,5 per cent in September, from 0,4 per cent in August. Credit card advances and bank overdrafts, however, continued to contract. In the banking sector, impaired advances to gross loans and advances declined marginally to 5,7 per cent in September 2010, having reached a peak of slightly over 6 per cent in November 2009. There is however some evidence that the banks are still charging higher spreads above the repurchase rate than was the case before the crisis, which indicates that the recent monetary policy easing has not been fully passed through to new borrowers. The fiscal policy stance has tightened moderately with the narrowing of the expected deficit before borrowing from the original estimate of 6,5 per cent to a revised estimate of 5,3 per cent for the current fiscal year, representing an estimated structural deficit of 4,1 per cent. The deficits for the coming fiscal years have also been adjusted downwards, and a 3,2 per cent deficit is expected in 2013/14. Most of the adjustment has been due to higher-than-expected revenue collections. The main risks to the inflation outlook continue to emanate from cost-push factors. These include wage trends and administered prices. Food and petrol prices are also identified as potential longer term risks. There are some tentative indications of moderation in wage growth. According to the Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average wage settlement rate amounted to 8,3 per cent in the first nine months of 2010, compared with 9,3 per cent in 2009 as a whole. However the Quarterly Employment Survey of Statistics South Africa indicates that in the second quarter of 2010 the year-on-year average nominal remuneration per worker increased by 15,8 per cent. The unit labour cost increase, which adjusts for productivity increases, amounted to 10,8 per cent, up from 10,3 per cent in the previous quarter. Global food prices have been affected by adverse weather conditions in a number of regions, but the impact on domestic prices has been counteracted in part by the rand exchange rate trends and the bumper maize crop. The exchange rate has also moderated domestic petrol price increases. Having remained relatively stable in a narrow range for the past few months, the price of Brent crude oil has increased over the past weeks to above the US$80 per barrel level, resulting in a cumulative increase in domestic petrol prices of 25 cents per litre in October and November, and a further increase is likely in December. Global oil prices are, however, expected to be constrained somewhat by slow growth in the advanced economies. In considering the prevailing conditions and data, it is important to emphasise that the focus, notwithstanding any immediate impact or influence, is on the situation that might exist 12 to 18 months hence. There are significant voices and varied opinions aired in the public domain, all expressing a view on what needs to be done. While it is important to listen to and hear what is being said, it is the responsibility of the Monetary Policy Committee to determine the path of interest rates without fear or favour. And this is what we will continue to do. The Monetary Policy Committee has taken cognisance of the improved longer term inflation outlook and assesses the risks to this outlook to be fairly evenly balanced. The domestic economic recovery remains fragile, and the adverse global developments make the growth outlook more uncertain. The MPC believes that while monetary policy cannot determine the long term growth path of the economy, it can impact on cyclical deviations of output from potential output. The view of the MPC is that there is room for further stimulus, given the weakness in the supply side of the economy. The MPC has accordingly decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 5,5 per cent per annum with effect from 19 November 2010. This action is viewed to be consistent with the continued attainment of the inflation target. The scope for further downward movement, however, is seen to be limited given the signs of recovery in household consumption expenditure and credit extension. This will be assessed on an ongoing basis. ADDENDUM TO THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. The Monetary Policy Committee meeting schedule for 2011 is as follows:."
Israel,2010-11-22,"22.11.2010 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for December 2010 unchanged at 2 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the rate of interest for December will remain unchanged at its current level of 2 percent. In addition, the Bank is widening the interest rate corridor around its interest rate in the credit window and the commercial banks' deposit window from C 2B 10.25 percent to C 2B 10.5 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The October CPI rose by 0.3 percent, which was the average of forecasters' inflation predictions. The housing component declined by 1.1 percent. Inflation over the previous twelve months was 2.5 percent, within the price stability target range. Since the beginning of 2010 the CPI has increased by 2.2 percent; excluding the housing component, it has increased by 1.5 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts:The average of forecasters'inflation expectations for the next twelve monthly CPIs remained stable at 2.9 percent. Expectations calculated from the capital market, however, increased to slightly above the upper limit of the inflation target. The average of the forecasters' predictions is that the interest rate in a year's time will be 3 percent. Most forecasters expect no change in the Bank of Israel interest rate for December. Real economic activity: Economic data published this month support the assessment that economic activity continued to increase in the third quarter and in October, at a somewhat slower rate than in the previous quarters. The main reason for the slower pace was the reduction in Israel's foreign trade against the background of the slowdown in world trade. GDP grew in the third quarter at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, compared with a rateof 4.5 percent in the second quarter. Part of GDP growth was due to a 10.2 percent increase in public consumption, and an increase of 9.7 percent in fixed investment. Against the background of the sluggishness in world trade. Israel's exports held steady in October in dollar terms, but in the months August-October average monthly exports were about 7 percent lowerthan in the previous three months. Imports, however, increased by 9 percent in October, in dollar terms, compared with their September level. The index of Google searches calculated by the Bank of Israel Research Department shows that the probability of recession has fallen to below 50 percent. Two indices of consumer confidence (those of Globes and Bank Hapoalim) fell slightly in October, but remained relatively high. The Purchasing Managers Index increased sharply in October due to increases in the components of demand for exports and production output. The composite state-of-the-economy index for October , which increased by 0.1 percent , shows that expansion continued, but at a slower rate than that evident in the first half of the year. The Bank of Israel staff forecast is that inflation in the next twelve months will be 2.5 percent, with a gradual increase in the interest rate to about 2.9 percent by the end of 2011. Risks to real activity and inflation in Israel derive essentially from developments abroad. The labor market and wages:Labor market data show that the economy is approaching the pre-crisis level of unemployment. The nominal wage accelerated in August, increasing by 1.3 percent, while the real wage increased by 1.1 percent (seasonally adjusted), compared with their levels in July; the increase in the number of employee posts slowed somewhat. Data on Health Tax receipts in October point to a continued increase in the total wagepayments. According to Central Bureau of Statistics data, the number of vacancies in the business sector continued to increase, and in October it was 50 percent higher than in October 2009. Budget data: The domestic deficit (excluding credit) from the beginning of 2010 until October was NIS 12.9 billion, compared with NIS 21.8 billion in January-October 2009. On the basis of the current data, the deficit in 2010, excluding credit, is expected to be about 4 percent of GDP, or even lower, compared with the deficit ceiling of 5.5 percent. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on October 24 until November 19, the shekel depreciated by 0.14 percent against the dollar, and appreciated by 1.43 percent against the euro, in line with the trends in the international markets. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel appreciated by 0.47 percent in this period. The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of October 24 and November 19, the Tel Aviv share price indices declined, in line with the trends in most stock markets abroad, but also reflecting domestic factors (the energy sector fell by about 10 percent during theperiod). The Tel Aviv 25 index dropped by about 0.5 percent in this period. Yields on Israeli indexed and unindexed government bonds increased in this period by between 10 basis points (b.p.) and 20 b.p. along the entire curve, except for short-term indexed bonds the yields on which fell slightly. These developments regarding Israeli government bonds showed the same general trends as did government bonds abroad, but to a more moderate extent. Yields on makam fell along the entire curve. The yield gap between Israeli and US unindexed 10-year government bonds contracted slightly this month, to 170 b.p., as yields on the US bonds increased more sharply than those on Israeli government bonds. In the corporate bond market the Tel-Bond 20 and the Tel-Bond 40 indices fell by 0.25 percent and 0.4 percent respectively. The yield gap between them and government bonds showed a mixed picture, with that between the highest- and lowest-rated bonds and government bonds contracting, while that between the other bonds and government bonds widened slightly. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread fell slightly this month, in contrast with the trend around the world, and reached 111 basis points. The money supply: The M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) decreased by 1.2 percent in October, following its 2.4 percent increase in September. In the last twelve months the M 1 aggregate increased by 4.6 percent. The M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) fell by 0.2 percent in September, following its 1.7 percent increase in September; in the last twelve months it increased by 0.9 percent. The credit market: Total outstanding business sector credit remained steady in September, at NIS 756 billion, after increasing by 1.2 percent in August, and by less than 3 percent since the beginning of 2010. Creditto households increased by a modest 0.3 percent in September, as a result of a moderate increase in the volume of mortgages, reflecting seasonal factors; since the beginning of the year this credit has increased relatively rapidly, by 7 percent. New mortgages granted in October increased again, by 11 percent, following their decline in September, so that the value of new mortgage issues returned to the level prior to the summer months. The housing market: House prices--which are presented in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices and which are not included in the CPI--continued to increase. In August-September they increased by 1.9 percent, following an increase of 1.3 percent in July-August. Since the beginning of the year house prices have risen by 11.6 percent, and in the last twelve months by 19.7 percent. In contrast, the housing index, which is based on renewed rental contracts and which is included in the CPI, fell by 1.1 percent in October. The global economy: Most economic data published this month present a positive picture, particularly with regard to the US economy, and lessso with regard to Europe. In Europe concern grew over a debt crisis in several countries. It is generally assessed that the global economy has recovered from the trough level it reached, and that the probability of another recession has declined. Some investment houses updated their growth forecasts for the coming quarters upwards, but the OECD reduced its forecasts. The rate of growth of the global economy continues to constitute the main causefor concern. Inflation in the advanced economies remains low, mainly due to their output gaps. In the emerging market economies inflationary pressures grew stronger, due mainly to the increases in commodity prices. In several countries intervention in foreign currency markets continued this month, including in some the imposition of restrictions on capital flows. In the leading economies monetary policy continued to be expansionary, and in the US another quantitative easing program. QE 2, was activated. Several central banks of economies that are already showing relatively rapid growth continued last month with their process of increasing interest rates. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for December unchanged at 2 percent is consistent with the gradual process of returning the interest rate to a more normal level intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to support the further recovery of economic activity, while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate is not pre-determined, but is set in accordance with the inflation environment, growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the leading central banks, and developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. At the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. Inflation in the last twelve months is within the target range, and according to predictions of the private forecasters and of the Bank of Israel Research Department it is expected to be slightly above the upper limit of the inflation target range in the first half of 2011, and then to return to within the target range. Inflation expectations calculated from the capital market for one year ahead were slightly above the upper limit of the target range this month. Most of last month's economic indicators support the assessment that economic activity continued to expand in the third quarter and in October. The decline in exports, however--reflecting the effect of the weakness of world trade--following the rapid increase in exports in the first half of the year, also featured prominently in the data. The lack of certainty regarding the sustainability of domestic growth deriving from uncertainty about global demand still constitutes a significant risk factor. Interest rates of the leading advanced economies' central banks are low, and are expected to remain low for a long time; the Fed reintroduced instruments of quantitative easing. Against this background, the differentials between interest rates in countries with relatively rapid rates of growth, including Israel, and those in the advanced economies present a serious challenge for policy makers in the rapidly growing economies who need to strike a balance between domestic pressures to increase the interest rate and the effect such an increase may have with regard to appreciation of their currency and its effect on exports and economic activity. House prices (which are not included in the CPI) continued to increase rapidly. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor the effects of the policy measures it introduced in the real estate market, which are intended to support financial stability and to moderate the rate of house price increases in the coming months. In light of the above considerations, the Governor decided to keep the rate of interest unchanged for December, at 2 percent. As part of the process of normalizing monetary policy, the Bank of Israel has decided to widen the interest rate corridor around its interest rate in the credit window and the commercial banks' deposit window from C 2B 10.25 percent to C 2B 10.5 percent. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic and financial developments, and will use the instruments available to itto achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the housing market, and especially on house prices. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on December 6, 2010. The decision regarding the interest rate for January 2011 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. December 27, 2010. The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for December 2010 unchanged at 2 percent. The Bank of Israel announces that the rate of interest for December will remain unchanged at its current level of 2 percent. Background conditions. Inflation data: The October CPI rose by 0.3 percent, which was the average of forecasters' inflation predictions. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for December unchanged at 2 percent is consistent with the gradual process of returning the interest rate to a more normal level intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to support the further recovery of economic activity, while maintaining financial stability."
Nigeria,2010-11-22,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 73 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. November 22-23, 2010 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 22nd and 23rd November, 2010 to review domestic and international economic and financial conditions in order to reassess the options for monetary policy for the rest of the year and beyond. On the global scene, the Committee noted with concern the continued slowdown in global economic recovery, especially in the US against the backdrop of the huge US trade deficit, requiring both domestic and external rebalancing of demand. On the domestic front, the MPC noted the high economic growth rate and the progress made towards restoring stability in the banking sector. It however, observed with concern the continued high inflation rate and reiterated the urgent need for fiscal consolidation and the continuation of comprehensive economic and structural reforms to remove supply-side bottlenecks. Key Domestic Macroeconomic and Financial Developments Output and Prices: The Committee observed the sustained impressive output growth recorded thus far in 2010. Provisional data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicates that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to grow by 829 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2010, up from 786 per cent recorded in the third quarter. Overall GDP growth for 2010 is projected at 785 per cent compared with 696 per cent recorded in 2009. The non-oil sector remained the main driver of overall growth. The Committee, however, cautioned that the recent slowdown in economic activity in some major advanced economies could have adverse effects on commodity-producing economies like Nigeria, notwithstanding the expected high crude oil prices in the international markets. While urging greater efforts at diversifying the economy, the Committee stressed the need for policy reforms to address the binding growth constraints on the domestic economy, especially, infrastructural inadequacy. The Committee noted with satisfaction the progress 1 made thus far on the power sector front, but stressed the need for renewed focus on the petroleum and agricultural policy sectors. The continued dependence of the country on imported food and energy, which is totally avoidable, is one of the main sources of erosion of our foreign reserves. The year-on-year headline inflation (rebased) stood at 134 per cent in October 2010 relative to 136 per cent in September 2010. Food inflation was 141 per cent in October, down from 146 per cent in September. However core inflation rose to 132 per cent in October from 128 per cent in September. The persistence of high inflation remains a major challenge, when viewed against the relatively good harvests, improved supply of petroleum products and weak expansion of credit to the private sector. This reality further underscored the need for addressing supply-side constraints in the medium to long term, and the urgent need to restrain debt-financed government spending in the short term. The MPC reiterated its earlier position on the threat of inflationary pressure arising from high inflation expectations, calling for stronger fiscal prudence to support the monetary policy stance. This is particularly critical for improving the dynamics of policy coordination. Nevertheless the Committee would continue to monitor price developments with a view to taking appropriate policy measures to stem any inflation threat and ensure that the upside risk to growth is minimized. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments: Provisional data showed that relative to end-December 2009, broad money (M2) grew by 425 per cent in October 2010, which, when annualized represented a growth of 510 per cent. Reserve money (RM), which stood at N1,,65386 billion at end-December 2009, fluctuated downward and by November 15, 2010, stood at N1,,444995 billion. Available data showed that in October 2010, aggregate domestic credit (net) grew by 1969 per cent over the December 2009 level, and by 2363 per cent when annualized. Credit to government (net), which grew substantially by 5335 per cent over end-December 2009 (or 6402 per cent on annualized basis), was the major source of expansion in aggregate credit. Credit to the private sector, grew marginally by 322 per cent (or 386 per cent on an annualized basis). In general, the growth in monetary and credit aggregates remained below the long term trends. The interest rates at the interbank segment of the money market responded to the increase in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) effected at the last meeting of the MPC in September in line with policy expectation. Consequently in October 2 2010, the average inter-bank call and open-buy-back (OBB) rates rose significantly to 845 and 753 per cent, respectively, representing increases of 526 and 461 basis points from the 319 and 292 per cent recorded in the preceding month. Developments in market interest rates indicated that the retail lending rates were still relatively high. The average maximum lending rate moderated slightly to 2185 per cent in October from 2220 per cent in September while the average prime lending rate stabilized at 1666 per cent. The weighted average savings deposit rate remained relatively stable while the consolidated deposit rates increased to 231 per cent in October from 207 per cent in September. Thus the spread between the maximum lending rate and the consolidated deposit rate narrowed marginally to 1954 per cent in October from 2014 per cent in September. The domestic capital market continued to show some signs of recovery. The All- Share Index (ASI) increased from 23,,05059 at end-September to 25,,30134 as at 15th November, 2010, or by 98 per cent. Market capitalization (MC) - equities only, increased by 431 per cent from N565 trillion to N808 trillion over the same period. The number of deals increased by 216 per cent, while the volume and value of shares traded decreased by 385 and 627 per cent, respectively. The increase in ASI and MC was principally due to the share price increases in the Banking. Food & Beverage, insurance and Oil/Gas sectors, and new and supplementary listings of shares on the exchange. The Committee believes that the effective take-off of the Asset Management Corporation (AMCON) and progress made on resolution of the banking system crisis have been major contributions to this improvement in sentiment. External Sector Developments: The foreign exchange market remained relatively stable. The total foreign exchange inflow in October was US$238 billion, representing a decrease of US$032 billion or 1185 per cent below the US$270 billion recorded in the preceding month. Total outflows or payments in October amounted to US$346 billion, a decrease of US$162 billion or 3189 per cent compared with US$508 billion recorded in the preceding month. Consequently the net outflow during this period was US$109 billion. Inflows from autonomous sources in October were US$1043 billion compared with US$755 billion in September. Cumulatively from January-October 2010, total foreign exchange inflows to the market amounted to US$ 8832 billion comprising funds from the CBN (US$2115 billion) and from autonomous sources 3 such as oil companies, international institutions and home remittances (US$6717 billion). The Committee noted with satisfaction the complementary role of autonomous inflows in moderating demand pressure in the foreign exchange market. In October, the WDAS average closing rate was N15125/US$ compared with N15107/US$ recorded in September, representing a depreciation of 18 Kobo (012 per cent). On November 15, 2010, the WDAS exchange rate was N15029/US$ compared with N15125/US$ for October, representing an appreciation of 96 kobo (064 per cent) At the interbank segment, the average buying and selling rates for October, were N15168/US$ and N15178/US$, compared with N15251/US$ and N15261/US$ respectively recorded in September, representing an appreciation of 83 kobo (or 054 percent). On November 15, 2010 the corresponding rates were N15065/US$ and N15075/US$ as against N15168/US$ and N15178/US$, in October, registering an appreciation of 103 kobo (or 068 per cent) At the BDC segment, the average buying and selling rates in October were N15198/US$ and N15398/US$ respectively, compared with N15230/US$ and N15380/US$ in September. The buying rate represented an appreciation of 32 kobo (021per cent) while selling rate represented a depreciation of 18 kobo (or 012 percent). The buying and selling rates on November 15 were N15150/ US $ and N15350/ US$ compared with N15198/US$ and N15398/US$ for October, represented an appreciation of 48 kobo (or 031 per cent). Thus the stability of the naira exchange rate since the first half of 2009 continued into 2010. The MPC believes that the relative stability in the foreign exchange market is likely to be sustained in the near term. The Committee would continue to monitor developments in the market to ensure that measures are taken to eliminate speculative demand and exchange rate volatility. The gross external reserves stood at US$3427 billion on 15th November, 2010 compared with US$33597 billion as at end-October and US$3459 billion as at end-September. The committee noted the elevated demand for foreign exchange at the WDAS which led to an increase in reserve utilization to defend the currency. It also noted recent moderation of demand pressure following Central Bank’s interventions to curtail speculative demand. It however, stressed that the solution to reserve accretion have to be in implementation of appropriate reforms to industrial and trade policy aimed at reducing import-dependence, and these are beyond the scope of monetary policy. The Committee’s Considerations 4 The key concerns noted by the Committee were: 1. The elevated inflation levels; 2. Rising government expenditure and borrowings with the possible crowding out effects on the private sector; and 3. Demand pressure in the foreign exchange market, leading to reduction in external reserves. The view of the Committee is that the solution requires both fiscal and monetary measures, and reiterated the need to eliminate unnecessary subsidies that add to government expenditure and debt. There is need also for continuing reforms in the economy particularly in the energy and agricultural sectors to curb high import bills through appropriate fiscal policies. The Committee remains conscious of its core mandate and reaffirms its commitment to price stability to engender sustainable economic growth. The MPC remained committed to exchange rate stability in order to attract foreign direct investment and anchor expectations. The MPC emphasized greater communications with stakeholders to remove speculative demand in the foreign exchange market. It also held that, in view of the low price elasticity of demand for imported necessities, depreciation of the currency would not in itself address the structural problem of import-dependence. The Committee continued to urge greater fiscal responsibility and commitment to reforms that will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. Overall members agreed that there is need for tightening, but the discussions centered on the form and the timing of the tightening. After due consideration of the pros and cons of various policy options, the Committee agreed on a majority decision of 6 to 4 members to retain the current policy rate, given the need to retain flexibility and allow the effect of the previous rate increase to work through the system, against the argument for immediate increase in view of the elevated inflation risk. Also the Committee agreed by a majority of 9 to 1 members to narrow the corridor around the MPR by reintroducing the symmetry of +/- 200 basis points. Decisions The MPC’s decisions were therefore: 1. To Retain the Monetary policy Rate (MPR) at 625 per cent. To adjust the corridor to +/- 200 basis points, implying Standing Lending Facility (SLF) rate of 825 per cent, and Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) rate of 425 per cent. Maintain the policy stance of a stable exchange rate. Continue to monitor inflationary trends with a view to taking appropriate steps as and when necessary. On the stance of monetary policy in the year ahead, the Committee reaffirmed that monetary policy would seek to exert pressure on aggregate demand, thereby helping to lower inflation expectations. In addition, monetary policy would stand ready to provide adequate and timely liquidity to support credit dynamics that would sustain fiscal mechanisms to bolster growth.

The MPC was informed of the absence of two members from the meeting, with apologies. One was the Permanent Secretary. Federal Ministry of Finance, while the other was Dr. Shehu Yahaya, who was bereaved. Minutes of the Previous Meeting 2) The minutes of the 216th meeting of the MPC held on Monday 21st September, 2010 were read without any error detected by members. Accordingly based on motions by Sam O Olofin and Adedoyin Salami, the minutes were adopted. Matters Arising from the Minutes of the Last Meeting 3) The Chairman advised that the Banking Supervision Department (BSD) should identify the customers with huge non-performing loans, and review the risks posed to banks if monetary policy stance was tightened. Members suggested that a second look be taken at the individual banks with large non-performing loans and proactive action taken so that another banking crisis would not surface. At that point, the Deputy Governor. Financial System Stability informed the Committee that the BSD was working towards solving 2 the problem and would report back to the MPC on the outcome of efforts made towards ensuring efficient supervision of the banks. Presentations by the Departments: 40 Trends In Crude Oil Production. Prices, and Foreign Exchange Reserves The presentation by the Research Department indicated that oil production in the country averaged 199 mbd in 2008, and fell to 182 mbd in 2009 with the lowest level being 160 mbd recorded in July 2009. However oil output rose to an average of 213 mbd in the first 10 months of 2010. Movements in oil prices were mixed. In 2008, prices rose from US$9425/b in January 2008 to the highest level of US$141/b in July, before falling to US$4495/b in December 2008. The upward trend was sustained in 2010 with prices ranging from US$7642/b in July to US$8745/b in November 2010. The lowest price of US$7642/b in 2010 was higher than the budget price of US$6000/b. The report indicated that oil export volumes had recovered in 2010 relative to 2009 on account of the rebound in both output and prices, but not yet to the level attained in 2008. External reserves which peaked at US$6208 billion in September 2008 had since declined steadily to 3 US$4023 billion in April 2010 and further to US$3360 billion by end-October 2010. The major reason for the decline was the near exhaustion of the excess crude oil account from a peak of US$2044 billion in January 2009 to US$199 billion at end- October 2010. The CBN portion of the external reserves had also been falling since August 2008 due to the high demand for foreign exchange. The report also showed that during the period, payments to the joint venture partners for cash calls and subsidy deductions for the NNPC rose significantly. Discussion Members concluded that there was a puzzle to be unravelled to know why foreign exchange reserves had been falling, as oil production and prices were rising. .0 Real Sector. Monetary Developments. Financial Markets. Global Developments and Outlook The highlights of the Economic Report presented by the Monetary Policy Department were as follows: Projections by the National Bureau of Statistics indicated that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would grow by 829 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with 786 per cent in the third quarter. GDP was projected to grow by 785 per cent in 2010, which would be driven by agriculture, 4 wholesale/retail trade and services sectors with relative contributions of 243, 223 and 207 per cent, respectively. The oil sector was projected to grow with the positive contribution of 063 percentage point in the fourth quarter as against 062 percentage point in the third quarter and 064 percentage point in the second quarter. In 2009, the oil sector contributed 014, 012 and 034 percentage points to GDP in the fourth, third and second quarters, respectively. i The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed that the year-on-year headline inflation decreased marginally to 134 per cent in October 2010 from 136 per cent in September 2010 and 137 per cent in August. However core inflation rose to 132 per cent in October 2010 from 128 per cent in September and 124 per cent in August, 2010. Food inflation fell to 141 per cent in October 2010 from 146 per cent in September and 151 per cent in August 2010The report noted that between 2009 and 2010, the volatility in inflation rate had moderated significantly in response to CBN inflation control measures as well as improved macroeconomic management. The report, however, cautioned that factors such as the anticipated injection by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), expected fiscal injection for 2011 election expenses 5 as well as rising consumer spending during the end of the year could pose inflationary threats in the medium term. iii) Interest rates in the major segments of the interbank market responded to the increase in monetary policy rate (MPR) and liquidity swings experienced during the review period. As at 15th November, 2010, interbank and OBB rates stood at 1056 and 823 per cent, respectively, trending above the MPR. At the end of October and September 2010, the rates in the interbank market were 845 and 319 per cent, respectively, while the OBB rates for the same period were 753 and 292 per cent. The average maximum lending rate fell to 2185 per cent in October 2010 from 2220 per cent in September and 2231 per cent in August 2010. However the average prime lending rate remained at 1666 per cent in both October and September 2010, having declined from 1689 per cent in August 2010. The weighted average savings rate declined marginally to 148 per cent in October 2010 from 149 per cent in September 2010. The consolidated deposit rate, however, rose to 231 per cent in October 2010 from 207 per cent in September and 227 per cent in August 2010. Thus the spread between the average maximum lending rate and the consolidated deposit rate narrowed marginally to 1954 per cent in October 6 2010 from 2014 per cent in September, 2010. iv) At the foreign exchange market, the average demand and sales per auction in October 2010 stood at $31295 million and $26250 million, respectively, indicating that 8387 per cent of the demand was met, compared with the average demand and sales of $43920 million and $35860 million in September 2010, which indicated that 8165 per cent of the demand was satisfied. During the period 1st-15th November 2010, five auctions were held at the wDAS with an average demand and sales of US$20623 million and US$16825 million, respectively or a sales/demand ratio of 8158 per cent. On November 15, 2010, the wDAS exchange rate closed at an average of N15029/US$ compared with N15125/US$ in October 2010, representing an appreciation of N096 or 064 per cent. In the interbank segment of the market, the average buying and selling rates on November 15, 2010 were N15065/US$ and N15075/US$, respectively, compared with the rates of N15168/US$ and N15178/US$ in October 2010. At the BDC segment of the foreign exchange market, the average buying and selling rates recorded on November 15, 2010 were N15150/US$ and N15350/US$, respectively, compared with the rates of N15198/US$ and N15398/US$ in October 2010. The premium between the average effective wDAS closing 7 rate of N15125/US$ and the average selling rate of N15398/US$ also widened at the BDC segment to N273/US$ (180 per cent) in October 2010 from N196/US$ (130 per cent) recorded in September 2010. The report noted that there were active movement of funds between the money and foreign exchange markets, and tight liquidity conditions in the interbank market tended to appreciate the naira exchange rate. The country’s gross external reserves stood at US$3427 billion on 15th November, 2010, representing a decline of US$032 billion or 093 per cent compared with US$3459 billion recorded at end- September 2010. The reserve level fell by US$82 billion or 1931 per cent when compared with US$4247 billion at end-December 2009. Total foreign exchange inflows in October 2010 was US$238 billion, representing a decline of US$032 billion or 1185 per cent from the US$270 billion recorded in September 2010. Of this inflow, crude oil/gas revenue was US$222 billion or 9326 per cent while the other inflows contributed US$016 billion or 674 per cent. Total outflows/payments during the same period amounted to US$346 billion, indicating a decline of US$162 billion or 3189 per cent below the US$508 billion recorded in the preceding month. Thus there was a net outflow of US$109 billion during the review period. Inflows from autonomous 8 sources such as oil companies, international institutions and home remittances in September and October 2010 amounted to US$755 billion and US$1043 billion, respectively. Autonomous inflows from January to October 2010 amounting to US$6717 billion, helped to augment foreign exchange inflows from official sources and to stabilize the foreign exchange market. v) The retained revenue of the Federal Government in September 2010 was N17739 billion compared with an expenditure of N16249 billion, resulting in a budget surplus of N1490 billion as against the proportionate budget deficit of N22215 billion for the month. The actual revenue was lower than the proportionate monthly revenue of N20782 billion by N3043 billion or 1464 per cent. Similarly the actual expenditure was lower than the proportionate monthly expenditure of N42997 billion by N26750 billion or 6221 per cent. The cumulative retained revenue of the Federal Government from January to September 2010 stood at N1,,86739 billion, which was lower than the proportionate budget revenue of N1,,87038 billion for the period by N299 billion or 016 per cent. The cumulative expenditure of the Federal Government for the same period was estimated at N2,,58855 billion and was lower than the proportionate budget estimate of N3,,86991 billion by 9 N1,,28136 billion or 3311 per cent. The estimated deficit resulting from the projected expenditure for the period (January to September, 2010) was N72116 billion. The budget deficit was expected to be financed from international bonds, signature bonus from oil block sales and FGN share of excess crude oil account, among others. vi) The broad measure of money supply (M2) grew by 425 per cent in October 2010, which when annualised, represented a growth of 510 per cent compared with the indicative benchmark of 2926 per cent for 2010. The growth in M2 reflected mainly the substantial growth in credit to the Government. Aggregate credit to the economy grew by 1969 per cent, which annualised to 2363 per cent as against the target credit growth of 5554 per cent for 2010. Credit to the private sector grew by 322 per cent in October 2010 or 386 per cent on annualised basis as against the benchmark of 3154 per cent for 2010. Credit to the core private sector similarly grew by 256 per cent in October 2010, annualizing to 307 per cent. Credit to the government grew substantially by 5335 per cent in October 2010 or 6402 per cent on annualised basis compared with 5136 per cent indicative target for 2010. The decline in reserve money (RM) observed in most 10 periods of 2009 continued into the fourth quarter of 2010 and remained below the indicative benchmark. Reserve money rose by 785 per cent to N1,,44995 billion on November 15, 2010 from N1,,34441 billion as at end-September 2010, but was below the 2010 provisional indicative benchmark of N2,,23244 billion for the fourth quarter by 3921 per cent. The reserve money (RM) forecast from end-November, 2010 to April 2011 indicated that the RM would continue to be below the quarterly indicative benchmarks during the forecast period. As at November 15, 2010, the DMBs’ requests for access to the CBN’s Standing Lending Facility (SLF) totalled N99665 billion as against N1,,09462 billion in October and N7310 billion in September, 2010. Patronage of the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) fell to N14665 billion on November 15, 2010 from N1,,11730 billion in October and N3,,82660 billion in September 2010, reflecting the tight liquidity conditions in the money market. vii) There was an increase of 98 per cent in the All Share Index (ASI) of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) to 25,,301 on November 15, 2010 from 23,,05059 at end-September 2010. Similarly the market capitalisation increased by 431 per cent to N808 trillion on November 15, 2010 from N565 trillion at end-September 2010. During the same period, the 11 number of deals increased by 216 per cent as against the decline in the volume and value of shares traded on the Exchange by 385 and 627 per cent, respectively. The increase in the ASI and MC followed the listing of 155 billion shares of Dangote Cement at N13500 per share and the supplementary listing of 173 billion shares of Unity Bank on the floors of the Exchange on Tuesday 26 October, 2010. viii) Developments in the Global Economy The performance of the global economy was mixed: • Mild threats of inflation were observed in most of the countries surveyed; • Stock prices rose in most countries; • Exchange rate developments were mixed across countries with appreciation in internationally traded currencies and depreciation in most African currencies; • All the countries surveyed maintained their policy rates except Chile. China and Nigeria that raised their policy rates in response to threats of inflation; • Selected indicators for the US economy suggested a slow-down in economic activities; and • The global commodities market was affected by several natural disasters such as severe flooding in China and Pakistan as well as wild firestorms 12 in Russia. Consequently commodity prices, especially food grains, trended upwards with the risk of inflation pass-through from major food exporters to consuming countries including Nigeria. ix) Outlook for the Future • Money market rates and other interest rates were not expected to moderate in the light of excessive government borrowing and the common year-end for banks. Inflation was not expected to moderate, thus making the single digit inflation target by the end of the year unrealisable. The growth in M2 would likely improve in the near term as a result of: o the sustained implementation of the CBN’s quantitative easing measures comprising the N3000 billion power and aviation sector intervention fund and the N2000 billion restructuring and refinancing fund through the Bank of Industry (BOI); o huge electioneering expenditures; o payment of FGN salary arrears following the approved new minimum wage to workers; o increased consumer spending during the year- end festivities; and o Commencement of operations by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON). Reserve money (RM) forecast for the period between November 2010 and April 2011 indicated that RM would continue to be below the indicative 13 benchmark. With the expected resumption of economic growth in the world’s largest and emerging economies, increased oil demand would keep oil prices above the revised budget benchmark of $60 a barrel. Meanwhile forward oil prices in the New York Mercantile Exchange were projected to range between $8537 and $8741 a barrel between end-November and May 2011. There was expected marginal increase in non-oil revenue due to the improved efficiency of tax collecting agencies. Oil production might fall following renewed hostilities in the Niger Delta area. Rising domestic debt of government would likely continue owing to expected shortfall in government revenue and planned issuance of bonds by the DMO. The naira exchange rate would remain stable in the near term if the liberalised exchange rate policy was sustained, while foreign exchange inflows from autonomous sources would continue to increase towards the end of the year. The capital market was expected to resume its upward trend in the near term following ongoing sanitisation of the market. Confidence in the capital market would return with 14 the commencement of operations of the AMCON. Pressure Points and Policy Challenges c) The report identified the following pressure points: • The continued underperformance of monetary aggregates, relative to long – term trends; • inflation threat resulting from anticipated liquidity injections; and • rising interbank interest rates as well as high but narrowing interest rate spreads. The challenges for monetary and credit policy in the near term were identified as: • providing adequate incentives for banks to lend to the real sector; • sustaining exchange rate stability in the face of declining external reserves; and • moderating inflationary threats. .0 Update on the Implementation of Previous MPC Decisions The updates were as follows: • N2000 Billion Refinancing/Restructuring Facility: i. Of this amount, the sum of N139199 billion had already been disbursed through the BOI; ii. N69.47 billion had been approved for disbursement as second tranche; and iii. amendments to the guidelines for the scheme had been approved. 15 • Application for Guarantee Certificate to the tune of N1075 million, made up of N1000 million to First Bank of Nigeria and N75 million to the National Economic Reconstruction Fund (NERFUND) had been approved under the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme. Resumption of liquidity mop-up through OMO in September 2010. Discussion of the Report The Committee noted that the budget deficit reported arose from huge government expenditure for subsidizing the consumption of petroleum products, and the increased wages to federal civil servants, the loss of revenue through duty waiver on rice imports, and the joint venture cash calls, among others. The Members agreed that fiscal discipline and structural reforms were needed to reduce the huge budget deficit. On money market rates, it was also noted that the spread between the open buy back (OBB) and interbank rates reflected the credit risks in the industry. Members were, however, informed that the spike in interest rates in October 2010 arose from information and communications technology (ICT) challenges in the Bank when the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform was undergoing upgrades. Members were informed that preserving the foreign reserves 16 of the country had implications for the economy, particularly, as manufacturing inputs, power, food and petroleum products were largely sourced from imports. In that regard, the Committee noted the limits of monetary policy and emphasised the need for reforms in order to reduce pressure on policy. On the underperformance of monetary aggregates, it was agreed that the monetary programme be reviewed, though the reason for the underperformance was attributed to the non- performance of fiscal operations. member observed that much of the domestic revenue was devoted to recurrent expenditure which left very little room for capital projects. Members also recognised that while Government borrowing would heighten money market rates. AMCON bonds expected to be issued to the banks would moderate the rates. Members noted that the Committee should be observant of the development of asset bubbles in the stock market. The Chairman reminded members of the Bank’s commitment to price stability, especially as the numbers that resulted from the revision of the CPI by the NBS, tended to suggest a heightened inflation threat. Members noted that the economy was facing an elevated Government recurrent expenditure as well as an unreasonably high demand for foreign exchange. 17 They equally observed that the high demand for foreign exchange was being fuelled by fiscal expansion. It was also noted that exchange rate stability encouraged the inflow of domestic and foreign investment. Proposals for Monetary Policy Actions Scenario 1: Retention of the MPR at 625 per cent and the current interest rate corridor: The argument in favour of the proposal was that maintaining the existing monetary policy stance would sustain market expectations with respect to interest and exchange rates, thus allowing uninterrupted implementation of approved policies and the achievement of their objectives. On the other hand, allowing the existing policy rate to remain would signal insensitivity to the inflation threat arising from the various liquidity injections anticipated towards the end of the year. Scenario 2: Raise the MPR by 25 basis points with the current interest rate corridor retained: The proposal would signal monetary policy tightening in response to the prospects of heightened inflationary pressures arising from anticipated liquidity injections in the near term. The argument against the policy action was its potential for raising lending rates and frustrating the efforts so 18 far made towards channelling credit to the real economy. Scenario 3: The MPR should be raised by 25 basis points and interest rate corridor adjusted to +300/-200 basis points implying SLF rate of 95 per cent and SDF rate of 45 per cent. The adoption of the proposal would signal monetary tightening and encourage interbank lending. The downside risk would be that the DMBs might be encouraged to use the SDF instead of making use of excess funds available at the interbank market. The Committee was invited to consider the proposals as presented. Discussion of the Proposals for Monetary Policy Actions In considering the proposals, the Chairman reminded members that the Committee could choose to leave the MPR unchanged, provide easy money to the Government and meet the foreign exchange demand. The Committee also could further tighten policy, thereby increasing the cost of Government borrowing, exert pressure on interest rates and reduce borrowing. The Chairman noted that the public debt would have been lower if the public revenue was earned from taxes on components of the GDP such as agriculture, services, manufacturing and value added tax like what obtains in other countries. question was raised as to whether the shutting down of the Class A BDCs was not 19 a signal of policy inconsistency. The Chairman stated that the Class A BDCs were responsible for creating distortions and speculation in the market giving the impression of money laundering. member asked whether the Class A BDCs could migrate to Class B BDCs to which the Chairman stated that the more the Class B BDCs the better, so that members of the public could easily access them for their foreign exchange needs. The meeting ended on Day 1 with a prayer by LA. Yuguda Acting Director of Reserve Management. DAY 2, 23RD November, 2010 The meeting commenced with a prayer by Suleiman Barau. Deputy Governor. Corporate Services. The Chairman reminded the members that they had agreed that there was need to tighten the monetary policy stance and that the pursuit of exchange rate stability would advance the cause of price stability. He noted that tightening the policy stance without fiscal discipline would not allow monetary policy to be effective. Accordingly tightening monetary policy could take the form of increasing the MPR or narrowing the interest rate corridor. He called on members to present their views before the voting. Members generally agreed on the need for tightening monetary policy but were divided on the modalities for achieving the objective. Some argued that an increase 20 in the MPR from the current level would not really tame inflation as no one knew when the 2011 budget would be passed and the size of the expected fiscal injections. Considering the impact lag on inflation of an increase in the MPR, and its likely effect on non-performing loans, it was agreed that the interest rate corridor should be returned to symmetry for the meantime while developments in the economy were watched until the next meeting of the Committee in January 2011. Moreover leaving the MPR unchanged could make credit accessible to the real sector and allow room for flexibility of action at the January 2011 MPC meeting. Voting and Decisions of the Meeting 7) After deliberations, the Committee through a majority decision voted to: retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 625 per cent; adjust the corridor +/- 200 basis points, implying the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) rate of 825 per cent and Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) rate of 425 per cent; maintain the policy stance of a stable exchange rate; and continue to monitor inflationary trends with a view to taking appropriate steps as and when necessary. v) On the stance of monetary policy in the year ahead, the Committee reaffirmed that monetary policy would seek to exert pressure on aggregate demand, thereby helping to lower inflation expectations. In addition, monetary 21 policy would stand ready to provide adequate and timely liquidity to support credit dynamics that would sustain fiscal mechanisms to bolster growth. Any Other Business 8) The Deputy Governor (Economic Policy) presented a proposal for the 2011 calendar of MPC meetings. The proposal sought to shift the dates of the meetings from the first week to the second or third week of the odd or even months so that there would be enough time to receive inflation and GDP data from the NBS. The Chairman noted that it would be too far to hold the first meeting of the year in February 2011 and decided that the first meeting should be held in January 2011. Date of Next Meeting 9) The next meeting was scheduled to hold on January 24 and 25, 2011. Closing 10) The meeting ended at 1222 pm. with a prayer by SO. Oni Director. Banking Supervision Department. ……………………………………… CHAIRMAN SECRETARY …………………………."
Poland,2010-11-23,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 23 November 2010 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 22-23 November 2010 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate at 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) discount rate at 4.00% on an annual basis. The moderate recovery in the world economy is continuing. Data on GDP in 2010 Q3 in the major developed economies point to a slight acceleration of the economic growth in the United States, with a concurrent slowdown observed  in quarter-on-quarter terms  in euro-area GDP growth. The continued favourable economic situation in Germany supports the rise in Polish exports. Economic growth in the majority of developed countries is still being curbed by high unemployment and ongoing adjustments in the balance sheets of households, enterprises and financial institutions. The continued rapid growth in the major emerging economies has been decelerating slightly, which is related to tightening of the economy policy in some of those countries, aimed at limiting the risk of growing macroeconomic imbalance. The effects of high fiscal imbalance and its planned reduction in the developed economies, as well as the effects of monetary expansion, including non-standard measures undertaken and envisaged by major central banks, continue to be an important uncertainty factor for the global economic growth. In line with expectations, the scale of monetary expansion in the United States was increased, which helped maintain positive sentiment of investors in the financial markets and contributed to higher commodity prices. At the same time, the intensification of fiscal problems in some euro-area countries, in particular in Ireland, was conducive to increasing uncertainty in the financial markets. Data on the Polish economy in the second half of 2010 signal faster economic growth than in the first half of the year. Industrial output continues to grow rapidly, construction and assembly output is also on the rise. Production capacity utilisation has been steadily rising. Enterprises continue to report a very good financial and liquidity situation. Enterprises increase their workforce, which approaches the pre-crisis levels. The employment rise is supported by continued high wage discipline. In 2010 Q3 the wage growth in the economy slowed down; limited wage pressure is also indicated by the data on wages in the enterprise sector. Wage growth may be slowed down by the growing number of economically active, which is also conducive to halting decline of the registered unemployment rate (adjusted for seasonal factors). Lending to enterprises remains limited, mainly due to reasons related to the demand for credit. There is a stable rise in mortgage loans to households, despite the fact that banks are tightening the ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, criteria for granting loans to this sector, which is primarily connected with an ongoing implementation of Recommendation T At the same time, banks are gradually lowering their margins included in interest charged on this type of loans. In October 2010 the annual CPI inflation rose to 2.8%, i.e. above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. The inflation rise was primarily connected with a further increase in food and energy prices, while core inflation net of those prices remained unchanged. At the same time, the remaining core inflation indices increased. In the months to come, the growth of food and energy prices may be expected to continue, which will be conducive to higher CPI inflation. In 2011 the level of prices may be additionally slightly increased by the announced change in VAT rates. In the Council's assessment, the still limited inflationary and wage pressure in the Polish economy and the persistent risk of increased capital inflows to the emerging economies, including to Poland, amidst the extended period of expansionary monetary policy of major central banks, combined with the risk of weakening of global economic growth, justify keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged. At the same time, the Council will continue to analyse the signs of a possible rise in inflationary pressure. An important factor affecting the monetary policy is the situation of public finance. Introducing decisive measures aimed at permanently reducing the deficit of the general government sector and at curbing the increase of the public debt is necessary for macroeconomic stability and will allow the meeting of euro adoption criteria. In the opinion of the Council, introducing measures aimed at preventing fast growth in foreign currency lending to households is important for macroeconomic stability. Such measures can also contribute to increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission mechanism. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the ERM II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organisational conditions."
Hungary,2010-11-29,"At its meeting on 29 November 2010, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to raise the central bank base rate by 25 basis points from 5.25% to 5.50%, with effect from 30 November 2010. The Monetary Council discussed the MNB's November Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Council's judgement, the Hungarian economy is likely to continue to recover from recession over the forecast period; however, output will remain below its potential level. Inflation is expected to rise in the short term, due to significant cost-push shocks hitting the economy. Under unchanged monetary conditions, inflation may remain above the 3% target for a sustained period. In the Council's view, there are risks that inflation expectations will rise due to persistently above-target inflation and that the cost-push shocks will have second-round inflationary effects. Hungarian economic growth continues to be driven by industrial sales on the back of strong external demand. Labour demand in the exporting sectors has increased, which has led to a rise in employment. Domestic demand may also begin to pick up in the course of 2011. Household consumption is expected to increase, due to the reduction in the personal income tax burden and improvements in employment. Investment is expected to increase as a result of a couple of projects undertaken in the manufacturing sector. However, investment activity may be restrained by heightened uncertainty surrounding the current business environment due to the imposition of sector-specific windfall taxes. Incoming data are consistent with the view that weak domestic demand and high unemployment continue to have a disciplinary effect on firms' price and wage-setting decisions. The pass-through of the depreciation of the exchange rate during the summer has turned out to be smaller than previously expected. Loose labour market conditions allow firms to restore their profitability by offering moderate wage increases rather than by raising prices. However, the economy has been hit by adverse cost-push shocks. There has been a broadly based increase in unprocessed food prices, which is likely to feed through into processed food prices. The passing on of some of the windfall tax imposed on certain sectors to customers may generate additional inflationary pressure. As a result of these factors, and assuming unchanged monetary conditions, inflation in 2011 may significantly exceed the 3% target and may remain above it in 2012. The Council notes that it is important that price and wage-setting decisions are consistent with significant spare capacity remaining in the economy and loose labour market conditions, despite the temporary upward effects on inflation. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have increased recently, due partly to the fall in global risk appetite and partly to country-specific factors, and particularly to a decline in the predictability of the economic environment. The latter is also reflected by the fact that since the middle of October Hungary's risk premium has risen by more than in other countries with similar risk profiles. The Monetary Council has decided to raise the base rate in light of inflation remaining persistently above the 3% target as well as the upside risks to inflation. It may be necessary to increase the base rate further in the coming months in order to meet the inflation target."
Pakistan,2010-11-29,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 29th November 2010 The economy's ability to achieve sustainable recovery remains constrained owing to slow progress in the prevailing security and economic conditions. The key economic variables impeding stabilization and thereby growth are high and persistent inflation, continuing fiscal slippages and unresolved power sector issues. Whereas adjustments in administered prices of fuel and energy and the post-flood disruption in the supply chain of food items have contributed to the recent upsurge in inflation, the high level of government borrowing from the SBP is diluting the effectiveness of monetary policy in containing excessive monetary expansion and thus inflation. The need for such borrowing is largely emanating from seemingly difficult fiscal predicament. While rising security and flood-related expenditures and continued power sector subsidies are one aspect of the problem, narrow tax base and declining tax to GDP ratio are bigger issues magnifying the fiscal challenges. The cost to the economy is being paid through erosion in the purchasing power of the rupee, growing total debt, and discouragement of productive private sector activity. High inflation, at fundamental level, persists because of money creation in excess of productive activity in the economy. Of the Rs308 billion expansion in reserve money up till 19th November 2010 during the current fiscal year. Rs266 billion is due to government borrowing from the SBP, which has been on an increasing trend since January 2010. Such borrowing has stoked expectations of increasing inflation, resulting in high interest rates. The nature of this fiscal expansion is the fundamental source of high inflation in Pakistan over the last year. Increases in electricity and domestic petroleum prices and the impact of the catastrophic floods on food prices did play their part in providing impetus to CPI inflation but do not fully explain the persistence in inflation. Further apprehensions that these supply shocks would dramatically worsen the inflation outlook have thus far not fully materialized. Temporary price hikes in the food category, as seen in monthly increase of over percent during August and September 2010, have somewhat subsided. As result, in Oct 2010. CPI inflation posted marginal decline of. percent on year-on-year basis, while. percent growth on month-on-month basis was well below the last 12 month's average. On the other hand, the persistent component of inflation, proxied by core trimmed inflation, remains sticky at over 12. percent on year-on-year basis since January 2010 and has increased to percent monthly change in October 2010, with expectations of further increases. An important source of this stickiness is the expectations of persistent reliance of the government on SBP to finance its deficit. Indeed the co-movement between persistence of inflation and that of government's financing gap is no coincidence. Therefore it would be difficult to bring inflation down unless government borrowing from SBP is curtailed substantially and kept under control on sustained basis. Government borrowing from SBP at an increasing rate reflects severe fiscal vulnerabilities. Given the delays in the introduction of tax reforms and weak industrial production, the task of achieving close to 27 percent enhancement in tax revenues during FY11 is beginning to look quite ambitious. To increase its capacity Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN to raise revenues and contain inflationary borrowings from SBP within an explicit and clearly defined limit, the government has shown its intention to: - widen the tax net through introduction of the Reformed General Sales Tax (RGST) along with other tax measures; i effectively contain the power sector subsidies; and, - amend the SBP Act, including explicit limits on government borrowings from SBP, which is now in the final stage of legislation. Together these could potentially address the problem in the medium term of stubbornly high inflation expectations, reduce the cost of borrowing, and hence pave the way for long term economic growth. However it may take some time before the benefits of such important measures, after their implementation, begin to have their impact. In the mean time, pressing flood-related expenditures and shortfalls in external financing of the budget have increased reliance of the government on domestic sources. The seasonal increase in the working capital credit requirements of the private sector during the second quarter is also higher on the margin due to higher input prices. Consequently pressure on the banking system and interest rates has increased. With low growth in the banking system Net Foreign Assets (NFA) and deposits, liquidity management has also become challenging. Therefore to further encourage the private sector, fiscal authorities need to demonstrate greater resolve in implementing their strategy to contain the fiscal deficit through fundamental structural reforms and their commitment to restrict inflationary central bank borrowings. However the recent rejection of the two PIB auctions in Q1-FY11 and acceptance of Rs50 billion instead of the Rs90 billion offered by the banks in the 16th November 2010 T-bill auction is apparently inconsistent with the stated intentions. Assuming real GDP growth of. percent and that the expected decline in private and public sector investment expenditures would be largely compensated by increases in public sector consumption expenditures, the external current account deficit is likely to be narrower in FY11 than earlier projections of. percent. Helped by higher cotton prices, the export earnings of $7. billion during first four months of the current fiscal year seem fairly encouraging. Similarly the recent trends in remittances coupled with expectations of realization of Coalition Support Fund (CSF) receipts could prove to be quite helpful in meeting import and other payments. The real test, however, would continue to be in the financing of the external current account deficit. Assuming that the projected external official inflows for FY11 do materialize, substantial growth in private foreign inflows would be required to maintain and build foreign exchange reserves. Monetary policy is essentially short term instrument with which emerging risks and uncertainties are managed. The impact of monetary policy on economic activity and inflation is indirect and operates with lag, and unlike the case of fiscal policy that tends to be reactive, it has to be proactive. Under the present circumstances, if the expansionary fiscal position is not expected to translate into high external current account deficit during the current fiscal year then it could be the case that the private sector demand is muted. Therefore the monetary policy stance could probably remain unchanged. However inflation is rising and showing persistence because of relentless government borrowing from the SBP. The rising NDA to NFA ratio of SBP balance sheet and its strong association with CPI inflation also suggest that inflation is likely to persist at double digit levels during much of FY11 and possibly in FY12. SBP's efforts to counterbalance the rapid expansion in reserve money and arrest the rising inflation expectations would require an increase in the policy Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN rate. After careful consideration of this trade-off. SBP has decided to increase the policy rate by 50 basis points to 14 percent with effect from 30th November, 2010. principled decision has also been taken to strictly implement the revised limits on borrowings of the provinces from SBP, even if it involves stopping payments to the provincial governments. SBP believes that the entire responsibility of tackling macroeconomic problems has been unfairly placed on monetary policy only. SBP also understands that the burden of this monetary tightening is being borne largely by the private sector, as it gets crowded out by the excesses of government borrowing for budgetary purposes and commodity operations, with all its adverse implications for sustainable economic growth.

Euroarea,2010-12-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council confirmed that the current key ECB interest rates are appropriate. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 4 November 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Recent economic data are consistent with a positive underlying momentum of the recovery, while uncertainty is elevated. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained. We expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations are firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. The Governing Council today also decided to continue conducting its main refinancing operations (MROs) and the special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the third maintenance period of 2011 on 12 April 2011. Furthermore, the Governing Council decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to be allotted on 26 January, 23 February and 30 March 2011 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. Overall, the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. The stance, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP grew by 0.4% on a quarterly basis in the third quarter of 2010, following exceptional growth of 1.0% in the second quarter. Recent statistical releases and survey-based evidence generally confirm that the positive underlying momentum of the economic recovery in the euro area remains in place. In line with previous expectations, this implies ongoing real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of this year. Euro area exports should further benefit from a continued recovery in the world economy. At the same time, private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to growth, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. This assessment is also reflected in the December 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, according to which annual real GDP growth will range between 1.6% and 1.8% in 2010, between 0.7% and 2.1%% in 2011 and between 0.6% and 2.8% in 2012. Compared with the September 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the range for 2010 has narrowed somewhat and shifted towards the upper end of September's range, while the range for 2011 is slightly narrower. The December 2010 Eurosystem staff projections are broadly in line with forecasts by international organisations. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are tilted to the downside, with uncertainty remaining elevated. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. At the same time, it is to be noted that the level of business confidence in the euro area remains relatively high. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the tensions in some segments of the financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Further downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.9% in November, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, unchanged from October. In the next few months HICP inflation rates will hover around current levels before moderating again in the course of next year. Overall, in the period ahead inflation rates should remain moderate. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This assessment is also reflected in the December 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 1.5% and 1.7% for 2010, between 1.3% and 2.3% for 2011 and between 0.7% and 2.3% for 2012. Compared with the ECB staff projections published in September, the range for 2010 is unchanged, while the range for 2011 is marginally higher. Available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture. Risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced. Upside risks relate, in particular, to developments in energy and non-energy commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. At the same time, risks to domestic price and cost developments are still expected to be contained. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 remained broadly unchanged at 1.0% in October, after 1.1% in September 2010. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased to 1.4% in October from 1.2% in the previous month. Broad money and loan growth hence remained low, supporting the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained. The steepness of the yield curve has continued to lessen somewhat, implying a gradual softening of the dampening impact on M3 that was associated with shifts of funds from monetary assets to longer-term financial assets outside M3. The interest rate constellation also includes a further widening in the spread between interest rates paid on short-term time deposits and those paid on overnight deposits. As a result, annual M1 growth has continued to moderate, standing at 4.9% in October 2010, after 6.2% in September, while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits continues to become less negative. The annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continues to conceal positive growth in loans to households, with 2.9% in October after 2.8% in September, and still negative growth in loans to non-financial corporations, which stood at -0.6% in October, unchanged from September. When correcting for the impact of derecognition of loans from bank balance sheets, the growth in loans to non-financial corporations continued to strengthen, further confirming that a turning point was reached earlier in 2010. Over the past few months, banks have generally stabilised the size of their balance sheets while expanding the provision of credit to the private sector. However, the challenge remains to expand the availability of such credit when demand picks up further. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 4 November 2010, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. Recent economic data are consistent with a positive underlying momentum of the recovery, while uncertainty is elevated. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained. We expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations are firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, while budgetary developments for some euro area countries are more favourable than expected, concerns about unsustainable fiscal positions and their vulnerability to adverse market reactions remain very high for others and have had repercussions throughout the euro area. In this environment, there is a clear need for the responsible authorities to strengthen confidence in sound public finances, thereby reducing risk premia in interest rates and supporting sustainable growth over the medium term. At the same time, all euro area countries should pursue ambitious and credible multi-year consolidation strategies and implement fully the planned corrective measures, focusing on the expenditure side. In their 2011 budgets, countries need to specify the necessary fiscal adjustment measures in detail, while standing ready to correct any slippages from the fiscal objectives announced. Substantial and far-reaching structural reforms should be rapidly implemented to enhance the prospects for higher sustainable growth. Major reforms are particularly necessary in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. The removal of labour market rigidities would further support the adjustment process of these economies. Increasing product market competition, particularly in the services sectors, would also facilitate the restructuring of the economy and encourage innovation and the adoption of new technologies. Such measures are crucial for enhancing productivity growth, one of the main drivers of long-term growth. All these structural reforms should be supported by an appropriate restructuring of the banking sector. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models remain key to strengthening banks' resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability. Finally, let me recall that the Governing Council welcomes the economic and financial adjustment programme which was agreed by the Irish government following the successful conclusion of the negotiations with the European Commission, in liaison with the ECB, and the International Monetary Fund. The programme contains the necessary elements to bring about a sustainable stabilisation of the Irish economy. It addresses in a decisive manner the economic and financial causes underlying current market concerns and will thereby contribute to restoring confidence and safeguarding financial stability in the euro area. The Governing Council welcomes the commitment of the Irish public authorities to take any further measures that may become appropriate to achieve the objectives of the programme."
South Korea,2010-12-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.50%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.50%) for the intermeeting period. In the global economy, emerging market economies have sustained their favorable performance, and the economies of major advanced countries have largely continued their moderate recovery trend. Looking ahead, the possibility cannot be ruled out that heightened volatility of economic activity in major countries and international financial market unrest due to government debt problems in some European countries may act as a risk factor for the global economy. The underlying upward trend of domestic business activity appears to have been maintained. Even though construction investment has continued to be subdued and facilities investment has decreased, exports have sustained their buoyancy and consumption has steadily increased. And, led by the private sector, labor market conditions have shown an improving trend. The domestic economy is expected to continue on an underlying upward track, even in the presence of external risk. Consumer price inflation has greatly decreased due to the stability of vegetable prices; however, upward pressures are expected to continue, being associated with the continued upswing in activity and the run-up in international raw material prices. In the real estate market, the scale of the decrease in housing sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas has narrowed and the upward trend of housing sales prices in other areas has been maintained. In the financial markets, stock prices and exchange rates have been highly volatile due to the reemergence of government debt problems in some European countries and the geo-political risks surrounding the Korean Peninsula. Long term market interest rates have declined in response to the planned reduction in the volume of Treasury bond issuance and foreigners' sustained bond purchases. The scale of the growth in mortgage lending has widened, with house transactions increasing somewhat. Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy in such a way as to help the economy maintain price stability, while sustaining sound growth. In carrying out policy, it will take overall account of financial and economic conditions at home and abroad."
Armenia,2010-12-10,"Press-release 12.10.2010 In the October 10, 2010 meeting, the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 7.25 percent. In September 2010, a 0.2 percent deflation was recorded against the previous month's indicator, and the 12-month inflation decreased by 1.0 pp, and amounted to 8.6 percent. The Board stated that in spite of high inflationary environment due to the developments in the international commodity markets and agriculture, the declining tendency of 12-month inflation, registered in September, will continue, and in the forecast horizon inflation will be near the upper border of the inflation band. The Board finds that in spite of slowing down of the economic growth rate, there is a gradual recovery of domestic demand. However the latter has not generated inflationary pressures yet. More over, the inflationary environment is eased due to the tightening of monetary conditions from the beginning of the year and currency market developments. Taking into account the present situation, where the inflationary environment is still affected by supply, including new risks developing in international commodities and raw material markets, the Board finds it reasonable to further withhold from tightening monetary conditions.

United States,2010-12-14,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November confirms that the economic recovery is continuing, though at a rate that has been insufficient to bring down unemployment. Household spending is increasing at a moderate pace, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising, though less rapidly than earlier in the year, while investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak. Employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. The housing sector continues to be depressed. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, but measures of underlying inflation have continued to trend downward. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. Currently, the unemployment rate is elevated, and measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low, relative to levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate. Although the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, progress toward its objectives has been disappointingly slow. To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to continue expanding its holdings of securities as announced in November. The Committee will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings. In addition, the Committee intends to purchase $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011, a pace of about $75 billion per month. The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming information and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to support the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A Duke; Sandra Pianalto; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S Rosengren; Daniel K Tarullo; Kevin M Warsh; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the policy was Thomas M Hoenig. In light of the improving economy. Mr. Hoenig was concerned that a continued high level of monetary accommodation would increase the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, would cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations that could destabilize the economy."
Peru,2010-12-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR DECEMBER 2010 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 3.0 percent. This decision takes into account the evolution of inflation and its determinants, as well as uncertainty about the evolution of the global economy. Core inflation and total inflation remain around the 2 percent target. Future adjustments in the reference rate will depend on new information on the evolution of inflation and its determinants, including information on the evolution of the international financial environment. Inflation in November recorded a rate of 0.01 percent, as a result of which annual inflation registered a rate of 2.22 percent. Core inflation, which showed a rate of 0.05 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 1.96 percent and remains around the 2 percent target. Annual inflation excluding food and energy recorded 1.23 percent in November. Inflation expectations remain anchored within the tolerance range. Indicators of economic activity continue showing a strong dynamism. Thus, for example, the production of electricity increased 9.7 percent in November. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 3.80 percent. Overnight deposits: 2.20 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.80 percent The Board will approve the Monetary Program for January 2011 on its meeting of January 6, 2011."
Chile,2010-12-16,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 16 December 2010 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.25% (annual). Internationally, signs of moderate growth in developed countries have continued, which contrasts with the dynamism of emerging economies. In the past few weeks, concerns regarding risk in some European economies have remained in international financial markets. The slow recovery of developed countries is still an important risk factor for emerging economies. The international prices of commodities—including foodstuffs and energy—have increased further, impacting inflation rates in some economies. Domestically, output, demand and employment figures continue on a positive trend. Inflation has been somewhat below expectations due to the lower inflation of imported goods. Private inflation expectations continue to be aligned around 3% over the relevant monetary policy horizon. The peso has appreciated against the dollar since the last meeting. The Board will continue to gradually reduce the current monetary policy stimulus, which will depend on the unfolding of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions. Accordingly, the Board reiterates that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2010-12-16,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release December 16, 2010 In its meeting held on December 16, 2010, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 825 percent and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 85 percen. Headline CPI declined by 082 percent in November following the 137 percent increase in October which led the annual rate to decelerate to 1019 percent in November from 1102 percent in Octobe. While the supply shortages related to fruits and vegetables in addition to red meat and poultry have largely eased during the past two months, their price increases since the beginning of the year continue to explain more than half of annual headline inflatio. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 069 percent in November compared to 040 percent in October, which pushed the annual rate to 858 percent in November from 775 percent in the previous month, mainly driven by the increase in a few non-food price. While non-food prices increased by 168 percent and 036 percent in October and November, respectively, these increases have been largely seasonal, associated with the beginning of the school year in October and Eid festivities in Novembe. Meanwhile annual real GDP growth for 2010/2011 Q1 registered 55 percent following 54 percent in 2009/2010 Q4. While investment has been improving following the retrenchment witnessed in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, its contribution to GDP growth remains limite. This coupled with increased uncertainty about the nascent global recovery could potentially weigh on domestic economic activity going forwar. Against the above and despite sporadic increases in non-food prices, underlying inflation pressures arising from the ongoing economic recovery remain containe. Nonetheless the MPC is mindful of the risk of possible propagation of shocks related to food items to other price. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Division Chief.

India,2010-12-16,"Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: December 2010 Monetary Measures It has been decided to: retain the repo rate at 6.25 per cent and the reverse repo rate at 5.25 per cent under the Reserve Bank's liquidity adjustment facility (LAF); retain the cash reserve ratio (CRR) at 6.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of scheduled banks. Liquidity Measures It has been decided to: first, reduce the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) from 25 per cent of their NDTL to 24 per cent with effect from December 18, 2010; second, conduct open market operation (OMO) auctions for purchase of government securities for an aggregate amount of 48,000 crore in the next one month, the schedule for which is being issued separately. The above two measures are expected to inject liquidity on an enduring basis of the order of 48,000 crore. Given the permanent reduction in the SLR by one per cent of NDTL, the additional liquidity support under the LAF announced by the Reserve Bank on November 29, 2010 will now be available up to the extent of 1.0 per cent (instead of 2.0 per cent) of the NDTL of SCBs from December 18, 2010 to January 28, 2011. Global Economy There have been significant global and domestic macroeconomic developments since the announcement of the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy on November 2, 2010. A slow recovery and persistent unemployment motivated another round of quantitative easing in the US. However, recent data show some signs of improvement, especially in respect of real GDP and consumer confidence, even though the unemployment rate has increased. Although economic recovery has been progressing in Europe, financial stability concerns have resurfaced as the sovereign debt problem spread further. Major emerging market economies (EMEs) continue to experience robust growth. Significantly, despite the slow recovery and slack capacity in advanced economies, international commodity prices such as oil, food, industrial inputs and metals have risen noticeably in recent weeks. Reflecting the strength of demand and higher commodity prices, inflation has started creeping up in most EMEs.2 Domestic Economy Growth GDP growth of 8.9 per cent in Q2 of 2010-11 suggests that domestic momentum remains strong. Agricultural growth has recovered on the back of a good monsoon. After flagging during August-September, the index of industrial production (IIP) grew by over 10 per cent in October 2010. Various indicators of industrial activity, including the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) also suggest a strong underlying momentum. Lead indicators of services sector activity have continued to increase at a robust pace. These developments reinforce the Reserve Bank's projection of 8.5 per cent for real GDP growth for 2010-11 which will be reviewed in the Third Quarter Review scheduled on January 25, 2011. Inflation After remaining in double digits for five successive months, year-on-year headline WPI inflation declined to 8.8 per cent in August 2010 and further to 7.5 per cent in November 2010. Consumer price (CPI) inflation for industrial workers and rural/agricultural labourers softened to single digit rates from August 2010, after remaining in double-digits for over a year. The overall reduction in inflation reflects moderation of food price inflation following a favourable monsoon. Food price inflation moderated from an average of 15.7 per cent in Q1 of 2010-11 to 12.3 per cent in Q2, to 10.0 per cent in October 2010 and further to 6.1 per cent in November 2010. Amongst food items, the moderation in inflation for cereals and pulses has been larger than that in inflation of protein related food items such as egg, fish, meat and milk reflecting the structural nature of food inflation. In addition, inflation for non- food primary articles such as raw cotton, raw rubber and minerals rose sharply. Reversing the declining trend in the last six months, non-food manufactured products inflation edged up to 5.4 per cent in November 2010. Though inflation has moderated, inflationary pressures persist both from domestic demand and higher global commodity prices. The pace of decline in food price inflation has been slower than expected due largely to structural factors. There is a risk that rising international commodity prices will spill over into domestic inflation. Going forward, rising domestic input costs for the manufacturing sector combined with aggregate demand pressures could weigh on domestic inflation. The risk to the Reserve Bank's projection of 5.5 per cent inflation by March 2011 is on the upside. Liquidity While the overall liquidity in the system has remained in deficit consistent with the policy stance, the extent of tightness has been beyond the comfort level of the Reserve Bank. This has been mainly due to persistence of large government cash balances which have averaged 84,000 crore since the Second Quarter Review of November, mirroring in the average net LAF repo amount of 1,01,000 crore. In addition, the liquidity deficit has been accentuated by structural factors such as significantly above-trend currency expansion and relatively sluggish growth in bank deposits even as the credit growth accelerated in 2010-11. While the liquidity deficit improved transmission of monetary policy signals with several banks raising deposit and lending interest rates, excessive deficits induce unpredictability in both availability and cost of funds, making it difficult for the banking system to sustain credit delivery. In view of the persistent liquidity pressures in November 2010, the Reserve Bank implemented some measures such as additional liquidity support to SCBs under the LAF up to 2.0 per cent of their NDTL, continuation of second LAF, and3 OMO purchase of government securities. While these measures have helped stabilise overnight interest rates, the extent of deficit could constrain banks' ability to expand their balance sheets commensurate with the productive needs of the economy. The additional liquidity measures initiated by the Reserve Bank respond to these concerns. As the economy expands, it needs primary liquidity, which will have to be provided in a manner consistent with the monetary policy stance. Such provision of liquidity should not be construed as a change in the monetary policy stance since inflation continues to remain a major concern. The measures taken in this review need to be appreciated in that context. Summing Up To sum up, the underlying growth momentum of the Indian economy remains strong. Even as inflation has moderated, it remains significantly above the comfort level of the Reserve Bank. Moreover, risks to inflation remain on the upside, both from domestic demand and higher global commodity prices. There is, therefore, a need for continued vigilance on the inflation front against the build-up of demand side pressures. A major challenge for the Reserve Bank in the recent period has been liquidity management. It is the Reserve Bank's endeavour to alleviate the liquidity pressure in a manner consistent with the monetary policy stance of containing inflation and anchoring inflationary expectations. Expected Outcomes The policy actions in this Review are expected to: release sizable primary liquidity into the system; bring down the liquidity deficit in the system close to the comfort zone of the Reserve Bank; and stabilise interest rates in the overnight inter-bank market closer to the operative policy rate of the Reserve Bank.

Turkiye,2010-12-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) was reduced from 7 percent to 6.5 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate was reduced from 1.75 percent to 1.50 percent, while lending rate was increased from 8.75 percent to 9 percent. The interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions was increased from 7.75 percent to 8 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate was kept at 0 percent, while lending rate was increased from 11.75 percent to 12 percent. Recent releases have been consistent with the outlook presented in the October Inflation Report. Although economic activity continues to recover amid strong domestic demand, it would take a long time before industrial capacity utilization rates return to their pre-crisis levels due to weak external demand. Employment conditions continue to improve, yet unemployment rates remain at high levels. With the additional support of falling unprocessed food prices, inflation is expected to decline in the forthcoming period. Primary objective of the central bank is to achieve and maintain price stability. Financial stability is one of the fundamental duties of the Central Bank as well. The divergence between domestic and foreign demand growth coupled with a rapid credit expansion is increasing the current account deficit, hence contributing to risks regarding financial stability. Moreover, recent developments and related policy decisions in European and US economies have been exacerbating these risks, necessitating a revision in the domestic policy mix. In this respect, the Committee has stated that a lower policy rate, a wider interest corridor, combined with higher required reserve ratios would serve as a more effective policy mix. Moreover, with regard to policy measures to enhance financial stability, the Committee has suggested that it would be useful to differentiate the required reserve ratios for different maturities of TL deposits in order to encourage longer term funding, and to widen the scope of the reserve requirements. The Committee assesses that the net impact of these measures on the monetary conditions will not be expansionary. The effects of today's decisions will be monitored closely and additional measures will be implemented if necessary. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Hungary,2010-12-20,"1) At its meeting on 20 December 2010, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to raise the central bank base rate by 25 basis points from 5.50% to 5.75%, with effect from 21 December 2010. In the Council's judgement, the Hungarian economy is likely to continue to recover from recession over the next two years; however, output will remain below potential throughout the period. Inflation is expected to considerably exceed the Bank's 3% target in the coming quarters, due to significant cost-push shocks hitting the economy. The Council judges that there is a risk that, in the absence of monetary policy tightening, inflation expectations will rise due to persistently above-target inflation and the cost-push shocks will have second-round inflationary effects. Strong external demand is expected to remain the main driver of Hungarian economic growth; however, recent evidence suggests that a recovery in consumption was under way in Q3. Household consumption is likely to pick up further, due to the easing of tax burdens on personal incomes and improvements in employment. In the Council's view, investment is only likely to materially contribute to growth from next year. Investment by companies will rise on the back of FDI flows into manufacturing, which, however, will be partly offset by heightened uncertainty about the business environment. Movements in the prices of industrial goods and services reinforce the view that weak domestic demand and high unemployment continue to exert discipline on price and wage setters. However, the economy has been hit by adverse cost-push shocks. The broadly based increase in unprocessed food prices has been feeding through into processed food prices. The passing of some of the sector-specific taxes on to customers and rises in fuel prices may generate additional inflationary pressure. As a result of these factors, inflation in 2011 may be significantly above the 3% target, and it is doubtful whether the target will be met in 2012 in the absence of monetary policy tightening. The Council notes that it is important that the price and wage-setting decisions are consistent with significant spare capacity remaining in the economy and loose labour market conditions, despite the temporary upward effects on inflation. Perceptions of the risks associated with Hungarian financial assets have not fallen, despite the improvement in investor sentiment towards emerging markets. The latest downgrading of Hungary's sovereign debt and the protracted rise in the country's risk premium relative to other CEE countries reflect concerns over fiscal sustainability and the predictability of the economic environment. The Monetary Council has decided to raise the base rate in light of inflation remaining persistently above the 3% target as well as the upside risks to inflation. In the coming months, the Council will decide whether to raise interest rates after weighing up the balance of inflation risks."
Czech Republic,2010-12-22,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 8th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 22 December 2010 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Bank Board decided by a majority vote to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.75%. Six board members voted in favour of this decision and one member voted for increasing rates by 0.25 percentage point. Reasons for the decision According to the forecast, headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates close to their current levels initially, followed by a gradual rise in rates at the longer end of the forecast. Its growth was driven mainly by investments in inventories and solar power stations; Annual growth in industrial production in October (6.9%) indicates a continuing recovery, but production fell slightly in m-o-m terms (-0.3%); The situation on the labour market has stabilised. The drop in total employment almost halted in Q3 (-0.2%). ILO unemployment stagnated (7.2%) and seasonally adjusted registered unemployment even slightly increased in the course of Q4. In November, growth in industrial producer prices (2.7%) and agricultural producer prices (23.4%) was in line with growing global commodity prices.

Georgia,2010-12-22,"22.12.10 The NBG Maintains Its Main Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) Unchanged The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on December 22, 2010 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 7.5 percent. Annual inflation reached 10.5 percent in November. The contribution of food in total CPI was around 9.1 percentage points. Annual price increase for services is 0.6%, which indicates the low inflationary pressure from the demand side. NBG's inflation forecast hasn't changed since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. The annual growth rate of monetary aggregates has recently shown the tendency to decline. It is expected that by the end of the year the annual growth rate of broad money will decrease even more. The bank loans extended to the economy continues to increase. In the recent period the foreign exchange loans have particularly grown. The National Bank continues monetary policy tightening. To that end it was decided to increase the reserve requirements for foreign exchange liabilities gradually up to 15%. The first stage involves the increase of the ratio to 10% by January 20th, 2011. The increase in the reserve requirements does not apply to capital and equated long-term assets. At the same time the National Bank will consider measures to stimulate long-term resources. In order to support the development of the money market the National Bank will decrease the interest rate corridor from 4 to 3 percentage points. Namely, the interest rate on overnight loans/deposits will be determined as the policy rate plus/minus 1.5 percentage points. This step will promote further decrease of the interbank interest rate volatility and deepening of money market. The NBG will closely monitor developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on January 18, 2011."
Poland,2010-12-22,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 22 December 2010 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 21-22 December 2010 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate at 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) discount rate at 4.00% on an annual basis. In line with the decision of the Monetary Policy Council of 29 September 2010 (MPC resolution No. 7/2010) presented in the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2011 regarding the withdrawal of the bill discount credit from the set of monetary policy instruments as from 1 January 2011 the discount rate will apply until the end of 2010. Moderate recovery in the world economy is continuing. Data from the United States and the euro area point to stabilizing growth in economic activity. Favourable economic situation has continued in Germany where GDP growth is to a growing extent supported by strengthening domestic demand. Yet, economic growth in the majority of developed countries is still being curbed by high unemployment and ongoing adjustments in the balance sheets of households, enterprises and financial institutions. The continued rapid growth in the major emerging economies has been decelerating slightly, which is related to tightening of the economy policy in some of those countries, aimed at limiting the risk of growing macroeconomic imbalance. The effects of high fiscal imbalance and its planned reduction in the developed economies, as well as the effects of monetary expansion, including non-standard measures undertaken by major central banks, continue to be an important uncertainty factor for the global economic growth. Following the previously observed depreciation connected with intensification of fiscal problems in some euro area countries and the ensuing uncertainty in the financial markets, the zloty exchange rate has stabilized in the recent period. At the same time, global markets have seen a rise in the prices of crude oil and other commodities. Data on the Polish economy point to acceleration of economic growth in 2010 Q3. Private consumption grew more rapidly than in the preceding quarters, supported by a rise in employment. Also temporary factors could have contributed to higher consumption growth. Wage growth in the economy, including in the corporate sector, has remained at a low level. The rise in wages may be curbed by the growing number of the economically active, which contributes also to the rise in unemployment rate as confirmed by the BAEL data for 2010 Q3. There are still no clear signs of a recovery in investment activity. Yet, production capacity utilisation has been steadily rising. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. Despite the favourable financial situation of the corporate sector, the divergence between the situation of exporters and non-exporting companies is increasing. Lending to enterprises remains limited, mainly due to reasons related to the demand for credit. Mortgage loans to households, including foreign currency denominated loans, continue to grow, which is accompanied by a gradual cutting of margins included in interest charged on loans. In November 2010 the annual CPI inflation fell to 2.7%, remaining above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. The inflation decline was primarily connected with a fall in food and energy price growth. The majority of core inflation measures remained unchanged. The growth of PPI is running at a high level. In the months to come. CPI inflation may be expected to be heightened by high growth in fuel prices and increase in majority of VAT rates planned for 2011. In the Council's assessment, the still limited inflationary and wage pressure in the Polish economy, uncertainty about the scale of acceleration of GDP growth in Poland and the global economic recovery justify keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged. At the same time, the Council will continue to analyse the signs of a possible rise in inflationary pressure. An important factor affecting the monetary policy is the situation of public finance. Introducing decisive measures aimed at permanently reducing the deficit of the general government sector and at curbing the increase of the public debt is necessary for macroeconomic stability and will allow the meeting of euro adoption criteria. In the opinion of the Council, introducing measures aimed at preventing fast growth in foreign currency lending to households is important for macroeconomic stability. Such measures can also contribute to increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission mechanism. Therefore, the Council expects that measures aimed at curbing the supply of new foreign currency loans to households will be introduced. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the ERM II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organisational conditions."
Israel,2010-12-27,"27.12.2010 The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for January 2011 unchanged at 2 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the rate of interest for January 2011 will remain unchanged at its current level of 2 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The November CPI rose by 0.1 percent, within the range of forecasters' inflation predictions of an increase of between 0 percent and 0.3 percent. Inflation in the last twelve months and since the beginning of 2010 stands at 2.3 percent, within the range of the price stability target. Excluding the housing component, the CPI has increased by 1.6 percent since the beginning of 2010. Inflation and interest rate forecasts:The average of forecasters'inflation expectations for the next twelve monthly CPIs remained stable at 2.9 percent. Expectations calculated from the capital market, however, decreased slightly, and are slightly below the upper limit of the inflation target range. The average of the forecasters' predictions is that the interest rate in a year's time will be 3.1 percent. Most forecasters expect no change in the Bank of Israel interest rate for January 2011. Real economic activity: Economic data published this month support the assessment that economic activity continued to increase at a rate similar to that in the third quarter, in line with the Bank of Israel forecastof 4 percent GDP growth in 2010. Initial partial data from the Bank of Israel Companies Survey for the fourth quarter indicate that economic activitycontinued to expand in all industries. The composite state-of-the-economy index for November, which increased by 0.1 percent following similarly moderate increases since July, indicates that economic activity continued to grow slowly. Government indirect and direct tax revenues continued to follow an upward trend in November. The Purchasing Managers Index increased in November, and was above 50 percent for the fourth consecutive month, indicating expansion. Consumer confidence indices declined this month, but their level still indicates continued growth. Foreign trade data show that goods exports increased moderately in November, and services exports surged by 11 percent in October, following a sharp increase also in September. The Bank of Israel staff forecast is that inflation in 2011 will be 2.6 percent, with a gradual increase in the interest rate to about 3.3 percent in the third quarter of the year. The main risks to real activity and inflation in Israel derive from developments abroad and in the local housing market. The labor market and wages: The positive developments in the labor market in the first half of the year continued in the third quarter. The unemployment rate increased to 6.6 percent in the third quarter from 6.4 percent in the second, but according to the Central Bureau of Statistics Manpower Survey Labor, this increase was accompanied by a 0.6 percentage point increase in the employment rate to 54 percent, and a 0.7 percentage point increase in the participation rate to 57.8 percent. The average real wage per employee post increased by 0.4 percent in the third quarter compared withthe second, and the nominal wage by 0.7 percent (both seasonally adjusted). Data on Health Tax receipts in November point to an increase in total wage payments compared with the total in November 2009. Budget data: The domestic deficit (excluding credit) from the beginning of 2010 until November was NIS 12.8 billion, compared with NIS 24.1 billion in January-November 2009. On the basis of the current data,the deficit in 2010, excluding credit, is expected to be about 3.5 percentof GDP, compared with the deficit ceiling of 5.5 percent of GDP. Assessments of the costs of the Carmel fire are that from a macroeconomic standpointthey will not be significant. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on November 21 until December 24, the shekel appreciated by 1.3 percent against the dollar, and by 5.5 percent against the euro, in line with the trends in countries showing rapid growth. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel appreciated by 2.8 percent in this period. The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of November 21 and December 24, the Tel Aviv share price indices increased, in line with but more moderately than the trends in most stock markets abroad. The Tel Aviv 25 index increased by about 3.2 percent in this period. Yields on Israeli indexed and unindexed government bonds increased in this period by between 10 and 30 basis points (b.p.) along the entire curve, with indexed bonds showing the greater increase. These developments regarding Israeli government bonds showed the same general trends as did government bonds abroad, which started with steep increases in yields in the US, although the increase in Israel was a more moderate one. Yields on makam increased along the entire curve as it flattened. The yield gap between Israeli and US unindexed 10-year government bonds contracted greatly this month, to 128 b.p., as yields on the US bonds increased more sharply than those onIsraeli government bonds. In the corporate bond market the Tel-Bond 20 index fell by 1.3 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 1.4 percent. The yieldgap between corporate bonds of all ratings and government bonds increased,in contrast to the worldwide trend and in contrast to the trend last year.Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread increased slightly this month, to 116 b.p., in line with the trend in marketsunaffected by the European debt crisis. The money supply: The M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) decreased by 1 percent in November, following its 0.7 percent reduction in October. In the last twelve months the M 1 aggregate increased by 1.7 percent. The M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits ofup to one year) increased by 1 percent in November, after remaining unchanged in October; in the last twelve months it increased by 2 percent. The credit market: Total outstanding business sector credit declined slightly in October, to NIS 747 billion, following a small drop in September; since the beginning of the year it has risen by about 2 percent. Credit to households increased by 1 percent in October, as a result of an increase in the volume of mortgages and in non-housing credit; since the beginning of the year outstanding credit to households has increased by 10.6 percent. The housing market: House prices--which are presented in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices and which are not included in the CPI--increased in September-October at a rate of 0.4 percent a month, following their increase of 1.9 percent in August-September. Since the beginning of the year house prices have risen by 12.2 percent, and in the last twelve months by 18.2 percent. The housing index, which is based mainly on renewed rental contracts and which is included in the CPI, remained unchanged in November, after falling by 1.1 percent in October. The global economy: As in the previous month, most economic data published this month present a positive picture with regard to the US. China, and in some countries in Europe, prompting the investment houses to significantly increase their forecasts of growth in the next few years. The revision regarding the US is the most notable, with forecast growth for 2011 being increased from 2.5 percent to 3.1 percent. In the US large amounts of liquidity are being injected as part of the monetary expansion, e.g. via the quantitative easing (QE 2) policy, and a new fiscal program, consisting mainly of tax relief. The markets brought forward their forecast timing of anincrease in the interest rate in the US. In Europe the debt crisis spread,with reductions in the ratings and rating outlooks in the European PIGS and doubts about other countries. In contrast. Europe as a whole, spearheadedby Germany, generally presented surprisingly buoyant macroeconomic data; in the third quarter these were based on domestic demand, and not only exports. In the emerging market economies, headed by China, rapid growth persisted. The favorable economic data published on the one hand, and the concern resulting from the high levels of debt and the European debt crisis on the other, prompted investors to switch this month from government bonds to risk assets and led to capital inflows into countries with high growth rates. The outcome was steep increases in yields on government bonds, strengthening of the currencies of countries with rapid growth, and increases in share prices. Inflation remained low in the advanced economies. Increased demand for commodities pushed their prices to record levels, boosting inflation in the emerging markets. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for January unchanged at 2 percent is consistent with the gradual process of returning the interest rate to a more normal level intended to position inflation firmly within the targetrange, and to support the further recovery of economic activity, while maintaining financial stability. The rate of increase in the interest rate is not pre-determined, but is set in accordance with the inflation environment, growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the leading central banks, and developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. At the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. Interest rates of the leading advanced economies' central banks are low, and are expected to remain low for a long time. Against this background, the differentials between interest rates in countries with relatively rapid rates of growth, including Israel, and those in the advanced economies--differentials which encourage short-term capital flows that tend to create pressure for the appreciation of the domestic currency--present a serious challenge for policy makers. Inflation expectations for one year ahead calculated from the capital market and thoseof forecasters declined a little and entered the target inflation range, and are currently slightly below its upper limit. The Bank of Israel Research Department forecast is that inflation in the coming year will be 2.6 percent, partly due to the appreciation of the shekel last month. Inflation over the previous twelve months is expected to be slightly above the upper limit of the inflation target range during most of 2011, and then to return towithin the target range towards the end of the year. House prices increased at a slower rate last month, while the housing component of theCPI declined in the last two months, partly due to the measures introducedby the Bank of Israel and the government to cool the real estate market. However, it is still early to know whether there has been a change in the trend of house prices. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor the developments in this market, and will take whatever steps are needed to underpin financial stability. Most of this month's economic indicators support the assessment that economic activityin Israel continues to expand at a rate of about 4 percent per annum. The investment houses revised their growth forecasts for the US upwards. Nevertheless, the debt crisis in several European countries is likely to reduce the pace of recovery in those countries and accordingly presents a risk to the rate of growth in Israel. In light of the above considerations, the Governor decided to keep the rate of interest unchanged for December, at 2 percent. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic and financial developments, and will use the instruments available to itto achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the assets market, and especially in the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on January 9, 2011. The decision regarding the interest rate for February 2011 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. January 24, 2011. The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for January 2011 unchanged at 2 percent. The Bank of Israel announces that the rate of interest for January 2011 will remain unchanged at its current level of 2 percent. Background conditions. Inflation data: The November CPI rose by 0.1 percent, within the range of forecasters' inflation predictions of an increase of between 0 percent and 0.3 percent. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for January unchanged at 2 percent is consistent with the gradual process of returning the interest rate to a more normal level intended to position inflation firmly within the targetrange, and to support the further recovery of economic activity, while maintaining financial stability."
Philippines,2010-12-28,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. The BSP's policy rates have been kept steady since July 2009. The Monetary Board's decision was based on its assessment that the inflation outlook remains favorable, indicating that current policy settings continue to be appropriate. Latest baseline forecasts show inflation settling within the target range of 4.5 ± 1 percent for 2010 and 4 ± 1 percent for 2011 and 2012. The forecasts are also supported by well-contained inflation expectations which continue to be within target over the policy horizon. The Board noted that the growth in credit and liquidity are broadly at pace with economic activity. Moreover, the current movements of asset prices, particularly in the equities and property markets, do not appear to pose any short-term challenge to the economy. At the same time, the Board noted that possible inflation pressures could come from generally higher global food and oil prices as well as the approved increase in tollway fees. In addition, while the rebound in investment is likely to add to productive capacity, leading to higher potential output over the medium term, a stronger momentum in demand growth may add to inflationary pressures in the short term. Looking ahead, the BSP will remain vigilant against any emerging risks to the inflation outlook and will adjust policy settings if and when needed to ensure that future inflation remains consistent with the medium-term target while being supportive of sustainable economic growth."
