Romania,2016-01-07,"Video (Romanian only): Press briefing, 07 January 2016. Statistical data point to the annual inflation rate remaining in negative territory since June 2015, in line with the projection, as a result of broadening the scope of the 9 percent reduced VAT rate to all food items, non-alcoholic beverages and public food services and declining fuel prices. In November 2015, the aggregate consumer price level stood 1.1 percent lower than in the same year-earlier period. The average annual inflation rate came in at -0.4 percent, while the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is relevant for assessing convergence with the European Union, averaged at an annual -0.3 percent. However, statistical data analysis shows that, leaving aside the impact of lowering the VAT rate, the annual inflation rate would have run close to 2 percent, i.e. inside the ±1 percentage point variation band of the 2.5 percent flat target. The faster economic growth in 2015 Q3 (3.6 percent) was stoked up by rising private consumption, amid higher nominal income of households, the lending recovery, lower indirect taxation and stronger confidence in the economy. Excluding the impact of the agricultural sector that was strongly affected by poor autumn harvest, gross domestic product growth stood at a post-crisis high of more than 5 percent. At end-2015, foreign exchange reserves amounted to EUR 32 billion, similarly to the level recorded a year before, after making payments on public and publicly-guaranteed external debt service of about EUR 7.2 billion. The reserves were fuelled mainly by EU fund inflows and the government's foreign borrowings. The current account deficit stood further at a sustainable level, namely below 1 percent of GDP, despite swifter increase in consumption, amid the improving services balance and larger transfers from the European Union, being entirely covered by autonomous inflows of direct investment. These developments helped preserve a relative stability of the exchange rate of the leu versus the euro, which fluctuated within a relatively narrow range in 2015, even though foreign markets were marked by swings in global risk aversion, geopolitical tensions and the diverging monetary policy stances of the world's major central banks. Interbank market rates fell further, touching record lows, reflecting the policy rate cuts and adequate liquidity management. The accommodative feature of real broad monetary conditions helped leu-denominated lending to recover. Thus, the annual dynamics of credit to the private sector advanced into positive territory, solely on account of the faster growth pace of leu-denominated loans (stemming from new business and loan conversion). Loans in domestic currency have come to prevail, i.e. 50.9 percent of the loan stock in November 2015, compared with a 35.6 percent low in May 2012, ensuring improved monetary policy transmission and the prerequisites for managing risks to financial stability. The outlook for the external environment is fraught with uncertainty surrounding the fragile growth of the global economy and international financial market volatility, whereas domestically the very fast growth of budget spending at end-2015 and the widening of the budget deficit during the projection horizon are a matter of concern. Over the short term, the annual inflation rate going again deeper into negative territory is reconfirmed, following the new round of indirect tax cuts (the lowering of the standard VAT rate to 20 percent, from 24 percent, as from 1 January 2016). Subsequently, the annual inflation rate will return to positive territory after the effects of the VAT rate cut in June 2015 have faded out, amid an easing of the fiscal policy stance and higher unit labour costs. At the same time, it is noteworthy the persistence of risks and uncertainties associated with certain developments in the external environment as well as on the domestic front, i.e. primarily associated with the fiscal stance outlook and the structural reforms to be implemented in an election year. Under the circumstances and based on the currently available data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum and to further pursue an adequate liquidity management in the banking system. Furthermore, against the background of slower forex loan dynamics and in order to continue the harmonisation of the reserve requirements mechanism with the standards and practices of the European Central Bank and the major central banks across the European Union, the NBR Board decided to cut the minimum reserve requirements ratio on foreign exchange-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 12 percent from 14 percent starting with the 24 January-23 February 2016 maintenance period. The minimum reserve requirements ratio on their leu-denominated liabilities remains unchanged at 8 percent. The NBR Board decisions are aimed at ensuring price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving lasting economic growth and preserving macroeconomic stability. To this end, a balanced economic and monetary policy mix, along with progress in structural reform implementation, is pivotal to preserving macrostability and robust economic growth in the process of achieving convergence with the European Union, as well as to enhancing the resilience of the Romanian economy to potential shocks or adverse conditions worldwide. The NBR monitors both domestic and external economic developments with a view to securing the adequate use and dosage of all its available tools to fulfil the overriding objective regarding medium-term price stability and preserve financial stability. In line with the preannounced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 5 February 2016, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Chile,2016-01-14,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 14 January 2016 Press Release1 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3.5%. Abroad, the policy rate hike by the Federal Reserve Board has caused no significant changes in global financial markets. The main development has been the volatility of financial markets deriving from events in China. In this context, emerging markets' currencies have depreciated— the Chilean peso included—and their sovereign premiums have risen. Stock prices have fallen, as have commodity prices, especially copper and oil. World activity indicators show no significant changes compared to last month's scenario. On the domestic front. December's monthly CPI inflation was somewhat lower than expected, and in annual terms was above 4% again. Core inflation—the CPIEFE—is still close to 5% y-o-y. Inflation expectations two years out remain at 3%. The evolution of these variables will continue to be monitored with special attention. Available fourth-quarter data continue to show limited growth in domestic output and demand. Confidence indicators are still in pessimistic territory. The unemployment rate remained low and annual wage growth was slightly less than in previous months. The future path of the monetary policy rate considers measured adjustments aimed to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target, at a pace that will depend on incoming information and its implications on inflation. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. 1 The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2016-01-14,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, and that the modest improvements in the euro area have continued. Economic growth in emerging market countries including China has meanwhile continued to slow. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that the possibilities exist of its being affected by factors such as the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy normalization. Chinese financial market conditions, and international oil price movements. Looking at the Korean economy, although domestic demand activities have sustained their paces of recovery, driven by consumption, the trend of declining exports has persisted while economic agents' sentiments have not improved. On the employment front, as the trend of increase in the number of persons employed expanded in December, the employment-to-population ratio rose compared to that in December the year before while the unemployment rate fell. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will continue its recovery going forward, centering around domestic demand activities, but in view of external economic conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high. Consumer price inflation rose from 1.0% the month before to 1.3% in December, due chiefly to increases in agricultural product prices and to a narrowing of the extent of decline in petroleum product prices. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will fall considerably short of the 2% inflation target for the time being, owing mainly to the disappearance of the effect from the cigarette price hike and to the recent further declines in international oil prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices meanwhile registered 2.4%, the same as in November. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices slowed somewhat in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country. In the domestic financial markets, stock prices and long-term market interest rates have fallen, influenced mostly by instabilities in the Chinese stock market and by the declines in international oil prices, while the Korean won has depreciated substantially against both the US dollar and the Japanese yen, on the effects in addition of Chinese yuan devaluation and increased geopolitical risks. Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic growth, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon, and pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as any changes in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy or in financial and economic conditions in China, the movements of capital flows, and the trend of increase in household debt."
Mongolia,2016-01-14,"THE BANK OF MONGOLIA MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Cutting the policy interest rate by 1.0 percentage point Number: 2016/01 Effective date: 14 January 2016 As its meeting on 22 December 2015, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia decided to cut the policy interest rate by 1.0 percentage point to 12.0 percent. Annual inflation measured by CPI decreased to 2.9% as of November 2015, has still been lower than the targeted level for the last 5 months, so it broadens monetary policy room towards expansion. Supply-driven inflation has still been low and stable whilst demand-pull inflationary pressure is expected to be at low level. Positive and stable outlook on foreign direct investment and its recovery in the medium-term shall support macroeconomic external balance. This decision on cautious and gradual monetary easing shall positively affect promoting monetary and credit growth, private sector investments and economic activities. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Poland,2016-01-14,"Warsaw, 14 January 2016 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 13-14 January 2016 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 1.50%;  lombard rate at 2.50%;  deposit rate at 0.50%;  rediscount rate at 1.75%. In the euro area economic recovery continues, yet activity growth remains moderate. In the United States  despite slightly weaker recent data  good economic conditions prevail and GDP growth in 2016 is expected to be slightly higher than in 2015. In turn. Russia and Brazil remain in recession, and the outlook for these economies has further deteriorated. In China, the data released in 2015 Q4 point to economic growth stabilization, albeit at a lower level than in the previous years. The possibility of a further deterioration in economic conditions in the emerging economies remains a significant risk for global growth. In the recent period, prices of oil and other energy commodities in the world markets have once again sharply declined. As a result, inflation in many economies  including in the euro area  remains close to zero. At the same time, in some economies  including the United States  core inflation is significantly higher than growth in consumer prices, which is driven by the ongoing economic recovery. Against this background, the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and the EBC continue to diverge. The Federal Reserve has increased its interest rates after seven years of keeping them at a near zero level. In contrast, the ECB has eased its monetary policy again, mainly by extending the period of the asset purchase programme and expanding its scope. The decisions of the major central banks and the sharp decline in crude oil prices have led to temporary asset price volatility in the international financial markets. In Poland, stable economic growth continues, driven mainly by domestic demand. Demand growth is supported by robust labour market, optimistic consumer sentiment and good financial condition of enterprises. However, demand growth is curbed by enterprises' uncertainty about the outlook for economic growth abroad. Due to the sustained negative output gap and only moderate wage growth in the economy there is no inflationary pressure in the economy. The annual growth rates of consumer prices and producer prices remain negative, although the scale of deflation is gradually declining. Falling energy commodity prices in the global markets are the main driver behind continuing deflation. Inflationary expectations are still low. 1/2 In the opinion of the Council, consumer price growth will slowly increase in the nearest quarters, yet due to renewed decline in commodity prices, consumer price growth may be lower than anticipated. So far, the continuing deflation has not had a negative impact on the decisions of economic agents. Gradual increase in price growth will be supported by closing of the output gap amidst improving economic conditions in the euro area and a tight domestic labour market. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, assessing that  given the available data and forecasts  the current level of interest rates helps to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and ensure macroeconomic balance. A more comprehensive assessment of the outlook for price developments and economic growth in the coming quarters will be possible after the Council gets acquainted with the March projection of inflation and GDP."
Peru,2016-01-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2016 BCRP RAISES THE POLICY INTEREST RATE TO 4.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 bps to 4.0 percent. This level of the policy rate is compatible with an inflation that foresees that inflation will converge to the target range in 2016, but takes into account the following factors: Inflation expectations are above the inflation target range. Inflation has been affected by temporary supply factors such as the rise in the prices of some food products and utilities as well as by the depreciation of the sol against the dollar, the effect of these factors not being foreseen to extend in a general manner to the rest of prices. Economic activity has been recovering. International indicators show mixed signals of global economic recovery, as well as volatility in external financial and foreign exchange markets. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants and stands ready to make adjustments in its monetary policy rate to lead inflation to the target range in the policy horizon, should it be necessary. Inflation in December showed a rate of 0.45 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 4.17 percent in November to 4.40 percent in December. The monthly rate of inflation is explained by the increase observed in the prices of perishable food products and transportation rates. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.53 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 3.46 percent in November to 3.49 in December. Recent indicators of economic activity and business and consumer expectations show an economic cycle with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output levels, but with a faster pace of growth in the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2016 the economy is foreseen to grow at rates similar to those of the potential output. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to raise the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.75 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.55 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.55 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for February at the Board meeting that will be held on February 11, 2016."
Turkiye,2016-01-19,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports, despite elevated geopolitical risks in other export markets. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Energy price developments affect inflation favorably, while other cost factors limit the improvement in the core indicators. Considering the wage developments and the impact of the uncertainty in global markets on inflation expectations and pricing behavior and taking into account the volatility in energy and unprocessed food prices, the Committee stated that the tight liquidity stance will be maintained as long as deemed necessary. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. The Committee also assessed the heightened global volatility since the beginning of the year and the January Inflation Report forecasts. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Euroarea,2016-01-21,"Ladies and gentlemen, first of all let me wish you a Happy New Year. The Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and after the recalibration of our monetary policy measures last month, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged and we expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. Regarding our non-standard monetary policy measures, the asset purchases are proceeding smoothly and continue to have a favourable impact on the cost and availability of credit for firms and households. Taking stock of the evidence available at the beginning of 2016, it is clear that the monetary policy measures that we have adopted since mid-2014 are working. As a result, developments in the real economy, credit provision and financing conditions have improved and have strengthened the euro area's resilience to recent global economic shocks. The decisions taken in early December to extend our monthly net asset purchases of €60 billion to at least the end of March 2017, and to reinvest the principal payments on maturing securities for as long as necessary, were fully appropriate. They will result in a significant addition of liquidity to the banking system and will strengthen our forward guidance on interest rates. Yet, as we start the new year, downside risks have increased again amid heightened uncertainty about emerging market economies' growth prospects, volatility in financial and commodity markets, and geopolitical risks. In this environment, euro area inflation dynamics also continue to be weaker than expected. It will therefore be necessary to review and possibly reconsider our monetary policy stance at our next meeting in early March, when the new staff macroeconomic projections become available which will also cover the year 2018. In the meantime, work will be carried out to ensure that all the technical conditions are in place to make the full range of policy options available for implementation, if needed. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP growth was confirmed at 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2015, supported mainly by private consumption, while being dampened by a negative contribution from net exports. The most recent survey indicators, available up to December, point to ongoing real GDP growth momentum in the fourth quarter of last year. Domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by the earlier progress made with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Moreover, the renewed fall in oil prices should provide additional support for households' real disposable income and corporate profitability and, therefore, for private consumption and investment. In addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is becoming slightly expansionary, reflecting in particular measures in support of refugees. However, the economic recovery in the euro area continues to be dampened by subdued growth prospects in emerging markets, volatile financial markets, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. The risks to the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside and relate in particular to the heightened uncertainties regarding developments in the global economy, as well as to broader geopolitical risks. These risks have the potential to weigh on global growth and foreign demand for euro area exports and on confidence more widely. Euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.2% in December 2015, compared with 0.1% in November. The December outcome was lower than expected, mainly reflecting the renewed sharp decline in oil prices, as well as lower food price and services price inflation. On the basis of current oil futures prices, which are well below the level observed a few weeks ago, the expected path of annual HICP inflation in 2016 is now significantly lower compared with the outlook in early December. Inflation rates are currently expected to remain at very low or negative levels in the coming months and to pick up only later in 2016. Thereafter, supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should continue to recover, but risks of second-round effects should be monitored closely. A more comprehensive picture of the impact of oil prices and other external and domestic factors on the outlook for HICP inflation will become available in the March 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, which will also cover the year 2018. Turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm solid growth in broad money (M3), with the annual rate of growth of M3 standing at 5.1% in November 2015, after 5.3% in October. Annual growth in M3 continues to be mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 11.2% in November, after 11.8% in October. Loan dynamics continued the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.9% in November 2015, up from 0.6% in October. Developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.4% in November, compared with 1.2% in October. The bank lending survey for the euro area for the fourth quarter of 2015 points to further improvements in demand for bank loans, supported by the low level of interest rates, financing needs for investment purposes and housing market prospects. Credit standards eased further on loans to enterprises, notably owing to increasing competitive pressures in retail banking, and reverted to a net easing on loans to households for house purchase. Overall, the monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 have clearly improved borrowing conditions for both firms and households, as well as credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the monetary policy measures in place and the need to review and possibly reconsider our monetary policy stance at our next meeting in early March in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2%. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. However, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. Given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies. In particular, actions to improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase productive investment, boost job creation and raise productivity. The swift and effective implementation of structural reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also raise expectations of permanently higher incomes and accelerate the beneficial effects of reforms, thereby making the euro area more resilient to global shocks. Fiscal policies should support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. Full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is crucial to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework. At the same time, all countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies."
Malaysia,2016-01-21,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. While the global economy continues to expand, the recovery in the advanced economies has not been as strong as earlier expected and the growth in the emerging economies has slowed. The current heightened financial market volatility and uncertainties also pose additional downside risks to global growth. For Malaysia, growth remains driven by domestic demand. While private consumption has moderated as households adjust to the higher cost of living, household spending is being supported by continued growth in income and employment. Overall investment has benefited from the implementation of infrastructure development projects and capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors despite the lower investment in the oil and gas sector. Going forward, while recent trends suggest a turnaround in exports, the contribution of the external sector to overall growth is expected to be modest. In this challenging environment, the economy is expected to experience more moderate growth in 2016, after expanding by about 5 percent in 2015. Downside risks to growth have increased following greater uncertainty on both the global and domestic fronts. In confronting this more difficult environment, the Malaysian economy will benefit from having diversified sources of growth, economic flexibility, low unemployment, manageable level of external debt, and a well-capitalised banking system and developed capital markets that provide continued access to financing. Headline inflation averaged 2.1% in 2015 and is expected to be higher in 2016, given recent adjustments in administrative prices and the weaker ringgit exchange rate. The impact of these domestic cost factors on overall inflation is, however, expected to be mitigated by the continued low energy and commodity prices and the generally subdued global inflation. In terms of trajectory, headline inflation is anticipated to peak in the first quarter of 2016 and to moderate thereafter. Recent external and domestic developments have continued to affect the ringgit exchange rate and domestic financial markets. The net external outflows have also led to a moderation in domestic liquidity. Bank Negara Malaysia's monetary operations have ensured that there is sufficient liquidity to support the orderly functioning of the money and foreign exchange markets. The financial system remains sound with financial institutions operating with ample liquidity buffers. Consequently, the growth of financing to the private sector continues to be healthy. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC recognises that there are heightened risks in the global economic and financial environment. These risks are being closely monitored to assess their implications on macroeconomic stability and the prospects of the Malaysian economy. This is to ensure that the monetary policy stance is consistent with the sustainability of the overall growth prospects. Bank Negara Malaysia 21 January 2016."
Israel,2016-01-25,"Background conditions. Currency (Unit) Rate Daily Change. Nominal Effective Rate -0.124%. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor December declined by 0.1 percent, in line with the average of forecasters' predictions. This month as well, there was a marked decline in the fruit and vegetables component (-5.3 percent) and a seasonal increase in the clothing and footwear component (6.2 percent). Inflation for 2015 was negative 1 percent. The main contribution to an increase in the CPI in 2015 was by the housing component, which contributed 0.5 percent. Energy components reduced the CPI by 1 percent, and price reductions initiated by the government decreased the CPI by a further 0.7 percent. Excluding those items, the inflation rate in 2015 was 0.7 percent. The inflation rate was also affected by the low inflation abroad, the decline in global commodity prices, and the effective appreciation of the shekel. Prices of components representing tradable goods in the CPI declined by 3.3 percent in 2015, and the prices of components representing nontradable items increased by 0.5 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Short- and medium-term inflation expectations declined this month, against the background of the continued decline in oil and commodity prices and the initiated price reductions: Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings are for an increase of 0.3 percent (compared with 0.5 percent in the previous month), and expectations derived from banks' internal interest rates are for an inflation rate of negative 0.3 percent (compared with 0.2 percent last month). One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market are negative 0.2 percent (compared with negative 0.1 percent last month). Three-year forward expectations declined from 1.3 percent to 1.0 percent. Medium-term and long-term forward expectations remained anchored within the inflation target range: Medium-term (3-5 years) expectations declined from 1.7 percent to 1.3 percent, while long-term (5 C2 AD-10 years) expectations increased from 2.1 percent to 2.2 percent. The path of the Telbor curve continues to reflect some probability of an interest rate increase in a year. Projections by private forecasters remain similar to those from last month: according to which the Bank of Israel interest rate will remain at its current level in the next few months, and increase slightly in about a year. Real economic activity: Partial indicators that became available this month continue to point to moderate improvement in economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2015, with growth based mainly on domestic demand. Despite the wave of violence continuing, its effect on tourism is moderating, and there is no noticeable effect on private consumption; The Consumer Confidence Indices compiled by Bank Hapoalim and bythe Central Bureau of Statistics showed improvement in December. Goods exports (in current dollar terms, excluding ships, aircraft and diamonds) declined by about 2 percent in December, through they increased by 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. The improvement is apparent only in high tech exports, while there is no recovery in medium-high technology exports. Goods imports (in current dollar terms, excluding ships, aircraft and diamonds) increased by about 5 percent in December, mainlydue to increased vehicle imports. In the fourth quarter, imports increasedby 2.9 percent. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.2 percent in December, due to increases in most components, other than goods exports, and the Index for November was revised upward. The Companies Survey for the fourth quarter indicated a slight improvement compared with the third quarter. The Purchasing Managers Index declined by 1.8 points in December, but for the third consecutive month is at a level indicating expansionof manufacturing activity. The labor market: The number of employeeposts increased by 0.8 percent in October compared with September, and increased by 2.4 percent from January to October, compared with the same period in the previous year. Nominal wages increased by 1.8 percent, and real wages increased by 1.9 percent, in August-October, compared to May-July (seasonally adjusted data), and the rate of increase in wages inmost industries in the business sector was higher than in 2014. Health taxreceipts for October-December were 5.4 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period of 2014. The job vacancy rate increased to 3.75 percent in December, and remained at historically high levels,even after adjusting for the sharp increase in demand for security guards in recent months. Budget data: The total deficit (excluding net credit) in government activity in 2015 was NIS 24.5 billion, or 2.15 percent of GDP, and the domestic deficit (excluding net credit) was NIS 5.9 billion lower than planned, as a result of underperformance of expenditureby NIS 3.6 billion, and revenue that exceeded forecasts by NIS 2.3 billion. Tax revenues were NIS 0.7 billion greater than forecast, and after adjusting for legislative changes and one-off revenue, they were 7.9 percent higher, in real terms, than in 2014. Domestic government expenditure in 2015 was about 4.9 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in 2014. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on December 27, 2015 through January 22, 2016, theshekel weakened by 2 percent against the dollar and by 0.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the preceding 12 months, theshekel appreciated by 6.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on December 27, 2015 through January 22, 2016, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 6.1 percent, against the background of sharper declines in global equity markets. Nominalyields declined sharply along the entire curve by up to 19 basis points, while on the CPI-indexed curve, medium-term yields increased by up to 9 basis points, as the curve flattened. The makam yield curve traded around the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, increased to 95 basis points. The money supply: In 2015, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 40.5 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 13.5 percent. The credit market: In November, businesssector debt increased by about NIS 1 billion (0.1 percent). In December, the nonfinancial business sector issued bonds totaling NIS 1.8 billion, lower than the average over the past 12 months (about NIS 2.5 billion). Corporate bond spreads remained stable, and withdrawals from mutual funds increased. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 3.1 billion (0.7 percent) in November. NIS 2 billion of the increase was in housing debt. The volume of new mortgages taken out in December was NIS 5.6 billion: slightly higher than the monthly average for 2015 of NIS 5.4 billion. In November, new mortgage interest rates remained virtually unchanged in all tracks.In December, there was an increase of 0.07-0.1 percent in the interest rate on mortgages in various tracks. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.4 percent in December, and by 2.2 percent in 2015 as a whole. In October-November, home prices increased by 1.1 percent, and in the 12 months ending in November, they increased by 7.6 percent. The number of transactions increased to 8,700 in November, slightly lower than the average of 9,100 transactions in the first half of 2015. An analysis of transactions by type of purchaser shows that activity by investors remains low, but is in an upward trend since September. The stock of new homes for sale increased slightly in November, to approximately 27,700 homes, following declines in the previous three months. The high rate of building starts in the past year is expected to continue being reflected in a high level of building completions in the coming period. The global economy: Data that became available this month indicate moderation in the rate of global economic activity and deterioration in financial conditions. The World Bank and the IMF reduced their growth forecasts. The IMF reduced its forecast for global growth in 2016 from 3.6 percent to 3.4 percent, and in 2017 from 3.8 percent to 3.6 percent. The forecast for world trade growth was reduced from 4.1 percent to 3.4 percent in 2016 and from 4.6 percent to 4.1 percent in 2017. The price of oil continued to decline sharply, and in recent days the price of a barrel of Brent crude traded below $30. Price of other commodities remained low. The rate of inflation remains low, supporting assessments that various economies will continue accommodative monetary policy. Prices on stock exchanges declined sharply. In the US, leading indicators point to moderation in the rate of growth, primarily for industry, against the background ofthe strong dollar, and assessments are that fourth quarter growth was low. There are signs of a slowdown in personal consumption expenditure, which led growth in recent years, although the labor market continues to display robustness: nonfarm payrolls increased more than expected, the unemployment rate remains low and stable, and wages increased by an adequate ratein the past year. Market assessments are that the federal funds rate will increase at a more moderate pace than that indicated by Federal Reserve officials' projections, despite those officials continuing to indicateconfidence about continued increase in the fed funds rate. In Europe, positive momentum continues but some slowdown is apparent, primarily against the background of weakness in private consumption and in industrial production. There was some improvement in foreign trade, and purchasing managers indices surprised to the upside. Unemployment continues to decline slowly, butits level remains high. The ECB indicated readiness to further enhance itsmonetary accommodation. In Japan, indicators of activity were disappointing this month, and together with the low inflation, they increase the probability for enhanced monetary accommodation there as well. In China, capital outflows are gathering strength due to the uncertainty regarding the economic situation, and the government was forced to sell foreign exchange reserves on a large scale, in parallel with taking various steps in an attempt tohalt the declines in the stock market. Weakness continued in emerging markets, particularly commodity exporters, which presents a risk to the overallglobal economy: 2015 growth in emerging markets is expected to be 4 percent, the lowest rate since the global crisis. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for February 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. In view of developments in the inflation environment, in growth in Israel and in the global economy, in theexchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, theMonetary Committee assesses that monetary policy will remain accommodativefor a considerable time. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. C 2B 7 Against the background of increasing volatility in financial markets and energy prices, the short-term inflation environment continued to decline this month, and there were declines in medium-term (forward) expectations as well. Long-term (forward) expectations remain entrenchedabove the midpoint of the target range. Further price reductions initiatedby the government (in public transportation, water, and automobile insurance) are expected to be reflected in the CPI for January and February. C 2B 7 Partial indicators that became available this month point to economic activity continuing its moderate improvement in the fourth quarter of 2015, and the effect of the security situation on economic activity remaining moderate. The Companies Survey indicates a slight improvementvis-C 3A 0-vis the third quarter. The job vacancy rate continues to increase, and together with an increase in wages reflect a positive picture in the labor market. C 2B 7 In the past month, global financial markets declined amid high volatility. The picture of activity remains positive in Europe, the picture is mixed in the US, and weakness continues in emerging markets. The IMF and the World Bank reduced their 2016 and 2017 forecasts for global growth and world trade. The ECB expressed readiness to further enhance the monetary accommodation, and market expectations are that the rate of increase in the federal funds rate will be lower than that expected last month. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on December 27, 2015, through January 22, 2016, the shekel weakened by about 2 percent against the US dollar and by about 0.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the past 12 months there has been an appreciation of 6.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and its level continues to weigh on growth of exports and the tradable sector. C 2B 7 In recent months, the increase in home prices accelerated, and they rose by 7.6 percent over the past 12 months. The volume of new mortgages taken out remains high. The elevated level of activity in the construction industry is expected to continue to contribute to increasing supply. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to achieving the inflation target have increased, and the risks togrowth remain high. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system,and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for February 2016 will be published on February 8, 2016. The decision regarding the interest rate for March 2016 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. February 22, 2016.

Nigeria,2016-01-25,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 105 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of Monday and Tuesday. January 25 and 26, 2016 The Monetary Policy Committee met on 25th and 26th January, 2016 against the backdrop of weakening global economic prospects as well as increased risks in the domestic economic environment. In attendance at the meeting were 10 out of the 12 members. The Committee reviewed the ensuing international and domestic economic and financial environments in 2015 as well as the outlook for the first half of 2016. On the global front, uncertainties and geopolitical tensions have increased in the Middle East, leading to a major standoff between two major oil producers; Saudi Arabia and Iran, in the face of improving relations between the United States (US) and Iran. In the global oil market, both Iran and the US are emerging as new suppliers while OPEC appears to have shifted from protecting price to defending market share. These developments underscore the conclusion that the current global oil prices would remain for a much longer period. Widespread stock market weaknesses and worsening macroeconomic conditions in China have further exacerbated the already stifling global economic challenges. These uncertainties have blended well with domestic vulnerabilities to affect the monetary policy environment in Nigeria. International Economic Developments The Committee noted the considerable divergence in global output recovery in 2015, as growth picked-up in the most advanced countries compared with slowdown in majority of emerging and developing economies. Following the slowdown in the emerging market economies, the IMF in its January 2016 World 1 Economic Outlook (WEO), revised its global growth estimate from 34 to 31 per cent and 34 per cent in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In the United States, growth has remained relatively firm with 2015 third quarter growth rate revised to 21 per cent from an earlier estimate of 15 per cent. The country's overall growth in 2015 is expected to be the strongest since the post- crisis recovery began in 2010. Likewise 2016 growth rate has been projected at 26 per cent. The major drivers of this growth remained improvements in consumption spending supported by a robust labor market recovery; low inflation stemming from soft global crude oil prices; massive and dynamic investments in the non-oil private sector, improved foreign investment demand due to the recent normalization of monetary policy by the Fed, as well as housing market recovery. Japan's recovery in 2015 remained fragile despite the continuous policy stimulus by the Bank of Japan. The Bank's asset purchase program injects ¥67 trillion ($5671 billion) monthly into the economy, with the possibility of expansion. However this has done little to restart growth which is estimated at 08 per cent in 2015. Private consumption and investment spending remained modest in 2015, worsened by rising skill shortages. Japan's outlook for 2016 remains dampened by the feeble response of the economy to monetary and fiscal stimuli. In the Euro area, weakening fiscal consolidation and improving labor market conditions generated 15 per cent growth in 2015 with prospects for achieving 17 per cent in 2016. The European Central Bank (ECB) further eased its monetary policy stance in December 2015, despite the Bank's continuous monthly asset purchase of €60 billion ($648 billion), as both inflation and wage growth remained subdued. In the same vein, the Bank of England continued its accommodative monetary policy through its ₤375 billion ($540 billion) asset purchase program, even as it announced a decision to reinvest another ₤63 billion ($907 billion), being the proceeds of redemption of the December 2015 gilt (government securities) held in the Asset Purchase Program. The Bank also maintained its core rate at 05 per cent in an attempt to herd inflation towards its target rate. Growth in the emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) decelerated to 40 per cent in 2015, the lowest since 2009, as both external and domestic challenges continued; owing to low commodity prices, financial market volatility, slowing productivity, policy uncertainty and eroding policy buffers as well as weak global trade. The slowdown in the majority of EMDEs has also been attributed to spillovers from weaknesses in major emerging economies, diminishing capital inflows, rising borrowing costs and other geopolitical factors. The stance of monetary policy in the advanced economies is expected to remain largely accommodative in 2016, except for the United States where monetary policy normalization has commenced. Against the background of suppressed commodity prices and slow recovery, global inflation is expected to remain moderate through 2016. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output Domestic output growth in 2015 remained moderate. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), real GDP grew by 284 per cent in the third quarter of 2015, almost half a percentage point higher than the 235 per cent recorded in the second quarter. However third quarter expansion remained substantially below the 396 and 623 per cent in the first quarter of 2015 and corresponding period of 2014, respectively. The major impetus to growth continued to come from the non-oil sector which grew by 305 per cent compared with the growth of 346 per cent posted in the preceding quarter. The major drivers of expansion in the non-oil sector were Services. Agriculture and Trade; contributing 142, 103 and 079 percentage points, respectively. The outlook for the fourth quarter of 2015, based on staff estimates, suggests further improvements over the third quarter growth level. The economy is expected to continue on its growth path in the first quarter 2016, albeit less robust than in the corresponding period of 2015. This expectation is 3 predicated on the current low global oil price trend which is projected to hold low over the medium-to long term, and with attendant implications for government revenue and foreign exchange earnings. Other downside risks to growth in 2016 include: capital flow reversal, high lending rates, sluggish credit to private sector and bearish trends in the equities market. However the Committee remains optimistic about a gradual recovery in economic activity due to notable improvements in power and supply of refined petroleum products, improved policy recalibration aimed at improving the flow of financing resources to the real sector and suppression of internal insurgencies, which will boost general agricultural activity. Prices The Committee noted the slight uptick in year-on-year headline inflation to 96 per cent in December, from 94 per cent in November and 92 per cent in October, 2015. The increase in headline inflation in November 2015 reflected an increase in the food component, even though the core component remained unchanged at 870 per cent. Core inflation declined for the third consecutive month to 870 per cent in November and December from 874 per cent in October 2015, while food inflation inched up to 1032 per cent from 1013 and 102 per cent over the same period. Consistent with its primary mandate, the Committee would continue to monitor consumer price developments with a view to formulating policies that will keep inflation in check. Monetary Credit and Financial Markets Developments Broad money supply (M2) rose by 590 per cent in December 2015, over the level at end-December 2014, although below the growth benchmark of 1524 per cent for 2015. Net domestic credit (NDC) grew by 1213 per cent in the same period, but remained below the provisional benchmark of 2930 per cent for 2015. Growth in aggregate credit reflected mainly growth in credit to the Federal Government by 15156 per cent in December 2015 compared with 14574 per cent in the corresponding period of 2014. The renewed increase in credit to 4 government may be partly attributable to increased government borrowing to implement the 2015 supplementary budget. During the period under review, money market interest rates generally reflected the level of liquidity in the banking system. Average inter-bank call and OBB rates, which stood at 100 and 150 per cent on 25 November 2015, closed at 475 and 450 per cent, respectively, on January 21, 2016. Between the November 2015 and end-December 2015, interbank call and OBB rates averaged 081 and 098 per cent, respectively. The Committee noted the bearish movement in the equities segment of the capital market during the review period. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) fell by 1306 per cent from N942 trillion to N819 trillion during the same period. However relative to end- December 2014, the indices declined by 3125 per cent and 2866 per cent, respectively. This development reflected capital flow reversals accentuated by soft commodity prices and monetary policy normalization in the United States. External Sector Developments The Committee noted the ongoing activities in the informal segment of the foreign exchange market, which led to the stoppage of dollar sales to BDCs, even as the average naira exchange rate remained relatively stable at the inter-bank segment during the review period. The exchange rate at the interbank market opened at N19700/US$ and closed at N19700, with a daily average of N19699/US$ between November 23 and January 11, 2015. The Committee underscored the necessity of improving the supply of foreign exchange to the market, especially from autonomous sources. It also reiterated its commitment to maintaining stability in the naira exchange rate. Committee's Considerations The Committee observed that the last episode of low oil prices in 2005 lasted for a maximum period of 8 months. However the current episode of lower oil prices is projected to remain over a very long period. Consequently it is imperative to brace up for a longer period of low government revenues from oil sources, which 5 would necessitate hard and uncomfortable choices as the economy transits to more sustainable sources of revenue, consistent with the economic realities and strategic objectives of the country. In the circumstance, certain tradeoffs must be envisaged and duly accommodated. In view of the foregoing, the imperative for consistently sound and coordinated macroeconomic policy has become inevitable. In the medium term within which monetary policy is cast, the need to allow policy to produce the desired outcomes becomes a key consideration in the policy mix. Consequently the Bank is fine- tuning the framework for foreign exchange management with a view to ensuring a more effective and liquid foreign exchange market, taking into account Nigeria's strategic development priorities; with the policies being designed within an environment of regularly ensuring consistency with monetary and fiscal policies. The Committee noted that at its November 2015 meeting, it eased monetary policy with a view to increasing the liquidity of the banking system. This was aimed at moderating domestic interest rates so as to encourage indigenous businesses to borrow. While the objective of stabilizing the financial system in the aftermath of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) withdrawals and J Morgan delisting of Nigeria have been largely achieved, the goal of increasing lending to key sectors of the economy is yet to be achieved as the Bank continues to adopt moral suasion to encourage the DMBs to support targeted lending to the real sector including agriculture, solid minerals and SMEs sub-sectors of the Nigerian economy. Despite current challenges, the Committee remains guided by evidence underpinned by credible data in its holistic evaluation of the emerging scenario and in its assessment of policy choices. Consequently the Committee believes that given sound and properly coordinated monetary, fiscal, and external sector policies, there is wide room for optimism about the medium to long term macroeconomic prospects for the Nigerian economy, especially, given the clarity in the policy direction of the administration, the various interventions in the real sector; gradual improvement in the power sector, and the reinvigorated fight against corruption. The Committee also believes that the effect of the softer 6 monetary policy stance adopted at the last MPC, should start crystalizing soon through expansion of credit to critical sectors of the economy. In addition, the unveiling of the Federal budget, oriented towards socio-economic and infrastructural development is expected to provide the necessary impetus for growth. The Committee acknowledged the continuous liquidity surfeit in the system stemming partly from the recent growth-stimulating monetary policy measures, as well as the tendency of the banks to invest excess reserves in government securities, rather than extend credit to the needed sectors of the economy. To this end, the Committee once again urged the deposit money banks to improve lending to the real sector, as part of their patriotic obligations to the country and enjoined the Management of the Bank to continue to explore ways of incentivizing lending to employment- and growth-generating sectors, particularly SMEs. The MPC also emphasized the necessity of coordination between monetary and fiscal policies as a prerequisite for resolving the nation's economic problems, particularly, steering the economy away from oil dependency. In particular, the Committee stressed the need for the fiscal authorities to compliment the Bank's low interest rate policy orientation by properly coordinating its borrowing activities (and rates) with the Bank in order to push the common objective of stimulating banking system credit delivery at low interest rates to the key sectors of the Nigerian economy. It noted that given the current economic reality of dwindling oil revenue and the rather unclear outlook for commodity prices, there would be need for a recalibration of the fiscal strategy to increasingly explore opportunities in non-oil tax revenue. Finally the Committee reiterated its unyielding commitment towards achieving a stable exchange rate regime to ensure more flexibility for sustainable inclusive economic growth in the medium to long term. The Committee's Decisions The Committee, in consideration of the headwinds in the domestic economy and the uncertainties in the global environment decided by a unanimous vote to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR). Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR). Liquidity Ratio (LR) and the asymmetric corridor of +2/-7 around the MPR. In summary, the MPC voted to retain: the CRR at 200 per cent; MPR at 110 per cent; Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent; The asymmetric corridor at +200 basis points and -700 basis points. Thank you for listening. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 26th January 2016 8."
United States,2016-01-27,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that labor market conditions improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed. A range of recent labor market indicators, including strong job gains, points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. As part of its annual organizational meeting actions, the Federal Open Market Committee reaffirmed its ""Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,"" with a revision to clarify that it views its inflation objective as symmetric, and with an updated reference to participants' estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate in the most recent Summary of Economic Projections (December 2015). Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook. In October 2014, in preparation for the annual reaffirmation, the Committee discussed the potential benefits of amending the statement to clarify that its inflation objective is symmetric. As indicated in the minutes of that meeting, there was general agreement on the symmetry of the objective. Following further Committee discussion regarding the most appropriate way to express this clarification, the statement has been amended to indicate that the ""Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below"" its 2 percent objective. All but one participant supported the amended statement. Given the economic outlook, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. The Committee first adopted the statement at its January 2012 meeting and has reaffirmed it, with appropriate revisions, at its annual organizational meetings each January. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Voting for the statement were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Stanley Fischer; Esther L George; Loretta J Mester; Jerome H Powell; Eric Rosengren; and Daniel K Tarullo. Voting against was James Bullard, who agreed the Committee's inflation goal is symmetric, but believed the amended language is not sufficiently focused on expected future deviations of inflation from the goal. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

Egypt,2016-01-28,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release January 28, 2016 In its meeting held on January 28, 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 925 percent, 1025 percent, and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 975 percen. Annual headline CPI remained largely unchanged at 1106 percent in December 2015, despite the slight monthly decline of 009 percent (m/m. The monthly outturn was largely subdued on the back of the seasonal decrease in volatile food prices, in addition to the muted movement in the prices of other food, supported by recent government measures to control the prices of basic food item. On the other hand, annual core CPI declined to 723 percent in December from 744 percent in November, supported by a favorable base effect from the previous year, despite the slight monthly inch up of non-food price. Looking ahead, while the upside risks to the domestic inflation outlook are mitigated by contained imported inflation, in light of the broad-based decline in international commodity prices, particularly given the latest global developments, potential underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain a concer. The latest data available reveals that real GDP grew robustly by 42 percent in 2014/15 after recording 22 percent (y/y) growth in 2013/1. The main contributors to growth were the manufacturing, construction, real estate and tourism sectors, while the extractions sector remained wea. In the meantime, strong investment growth more than compensated for the negative contribution of net export. Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects are expected to continue to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround the global economy given the latest global market developments could pose downside risks to domestic GD. At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlook. The MPC reiterates its price stability mandate and will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, particularly fiscal policy and its effect on the inflation outlook, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Ukraine,2016-01-28,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to leave the discount rate unchanged at 22% per annum. The NBU Board's decision to keep a restrained monetary policy in place will help mitigate mounting risks to price stability triggered by turbulence in the global economy and enable the NBU to achieve its objective of lowering headline inflation to 12% by the end of 2016 and 8% by the end of 2017. In the second half of 2015, headline inflation was on a firm downward path. In annual terms, headline inflation moderated to 43.3%, which was broadly in line with NBU projections. Core inflation continued to decline to 34.7% y-o-y. The subdued domestic demand. NBU's restrained monetary policy, and stabilization of inflation expectations have contributed to the easing of inflationary pressures in the last months of the year. The NBU has kept its headline inflation projection unchanged at 12% by the end of 2016 and 8% by the end of 2017. These projections are consistent with the NBU's medium-term inflation objectives. The fundamental factors that were at play last year will further support the disinflation trend this year. We primarily refer to subdued aggregate demand. The NBU has revised its 2016 outlook for economic activity downward. Real GDP is expected to grow at 1.1% in 2016. A weaker-than-previously expected economic recovery can be attributed to lower-than-expected global commodity prices, deteriorating global economic growth prospects, and fresh trade restrictions imposed by the Russian Federation, including a ban on the transit of Ukrainian goods through its territory. A further decline in inflation expectations, cancellation of a temporary surcharge on imports, as well as low global energy and food prices, are among the factors supporting the downward trend in inflation. On the other hand, a sharper decline in inflation will be restrained by further upward adjustments in administrated prices. The major downside risks to the inflation forecast and consequently the achievement of the NBU's 2016 inflation objective include external factors that determine the balance of payments and the exchange rate path of the hryvnia. The NBU has already revised its current account deficit forecast upwards to USD 2.5 billion, or 3% of GDP. Should downside risks materialize, this deficit could be higher, which in turn would adversely affect the path of inflation. These downside risks primarily include falling global prices for key Ukrainian export commodities. Second, downside risks may arise from depreciation of the currencies of Ukraine's trade partner countries. In view of the high likelihood of these risks to materialise and the NBU's commitment to its price stability objective, the NBU deems it necessary to maintain the current monetary conditions. Going forward, provided that inflationary risks subside primarily due to stabilization of the global commodity markets and the disbursement of the next tranches of official financing, the NBU may resume the gradual easing of monetary policy. At the same time, should the aforementioned risks materialize, the NBU will be forced to keep a restrained monetary policy in place for a longer period to achieve its inflation objectives.

South Africa,2016-01-28,"South African Reserve Bank Press Statement Embargo on Delivery 28 January 2016 Statement of the Monetary Policy Committee Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the inflation outlook has deteriorated significantly, mainly due to exchange rate and food price developments. The rand has depreciated considerably in response to domestic and external developments, while the impact of the worsening drought on food prices is becoming increasingly evident. The outlook is complicated by the fact that the domestic growth outlook has weakened further. The global backdrop has also become more challenging particularly for emerging markets, and downside risks to the sustainability of the recovery in the advanced economies have increased. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 5,2 per cent in December, up from 4,8 per cent in November. This increase was broadly in line with market and the Bank's expectations, and reflected in part the delayed response of food price inflation to the impact of the drought on agricultural prices. Food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation accelerated to 5,9 per cent, up from 4,8 per cent previously and contributed 0,9 1. Food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation accelerated to 5,9 per cent, up from 4,8 per cent previously and contributed 0,9 1 percentage points to the overall CPI outcome. Goods price inflation increased to 4,6 per cent from 3,8 per cent previously mainly due to higher petrol and food prices, while services price inflation remained unchanged at 5,7 per cent. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, remained relatively stable at 5,2 per cent, up from 5,1 per cent in November. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased from 4,3 per cent in November to 4,8 per cent in December. The category of food, beverages and tobacco products contributed 2,1 percentage points to the December outcome. The latest inflation forecast of the Bank shows a marked deterioration. Having averaged 4,6 per cent in 2015, inflation is now expected to average 6,8 per cent in 2016 and 7,0 per cent in 2017. This compares with the previous forecast of 6,0 per cent and 5,8 per cent for these years. Inflation is still expected to breach the upper end of the target in the first quarter of 2016, but is now expected to remain outside the target for the entire forecast period. A peak of 7,8 per cent is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, followed by a moderation to 6,2 per cent in the final quarter of that year (5,7 per cent previously). The changes in the forecast are mainly due to a significantly more depreciated real exchange rate assumption, and higher expected food price inflation. These upward revisions more than offset the impact of the lower international oil price assumption. The electricity price assumption remains unchanged from the previous meeting. The forecast for core inflation has also deteriorated, although to a lesser degree than that for headline inflation. Core inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range for four consecutive quarters from the third quarter of 2016, with a peak of 6,4 per cent in the final quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. This measure 2 is expected to average 6,0 per cent in 2016, and 5,9 per cent in 2017, and to moderate to 5,5 per cent by the final quarter of next year. The deterioration in the forecast is mainly due to the more depreciated exchange rate assumption and expected higher unit labour costs. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research show a marginal upward movement for 2016 but a more pronounced deterioration for 2017, with average inflation expectations increasing from 5,9 per cent to 6,2 per cent, mainly due to the changes in expectations of trade union officials. Five-year inflation expectations edged up to 6,1 per cent, also mainly due to changes in the expectations of trade union officials. This survey was concluded prior to the depreciation of the rand in December, so the outcome of the next survey will be closely monitored. The impact of the rand exchange rate weakness on market forecasts is evident in the changes to the Reuters Econometer survey between December and January. Median inflation expectations were stable in November and December, at 5,9 per cent and 5,8 per cent for 2016 and 2017, but increased in January to 6,0 per cent and 6,1 per cent. The median forecast for 2018 is 5,7 per cent. Break-even inflation rates also increased significantly across all maturities, with the 5-year maturities rising to current levels of around 7,3 per cent. The global growth outlook appears to have worsened somewhat in recent weeks, contributing to a correction in global equity markets. Although most of the downward revisions to global growth have been due to the deteriorating prognosis for emerging markets, more recently the risks of a slowdown in the US have increased, amid declining consumer expenditure, and the impact of low oil prices and a strengthening 3. Although most of the downward revisions to global growth have been due to the deteriorating prognosis for emerging markets, more recently the risks of a slowdown in the US have increased, amid declining consumer expenditure, and the impact of low oil prices and a strengthening 3 dollar on business investment. However, despite the fourth quarter slowdown, growth of around trend is still generally expected. While the recovery in the euro area remains modest, the growth forecasts for the UK and Japan have generally been revised down. Emerging market growth prospects, particularly for commodity-producing countries, remain constrained amid persistent capital outflows. The outlook is heavily influenced by the slowing Chinese economy but there are conflicting views as to whether a hard landing can be expected. There is also uncertainty regarding the efficacy of policy reforms that have been undertaken. Perceptions of the modifications to the renminbi exchange rate regime as well as equity market volatility have added to this uncertainty. Global inflation pressures remain benign, reinforced by a further decline in international oil prices, but there have been upward revisions in some emerging markets. Monetary policies in most advanced economies are expected to remain accommodative. The slow pace of normalisation in the US is expected to continue, but further easing is expected in Japan and the euro area, while the Bank of England has indicated that monetary policy tightening is still some way off. Divergent monetary policy paths are also expected in the emerging markets. Commodity importers with sound macroeconomic fundamentals have scope for further easing, while some commodity producers, particularly those experiencing exchange rate- induced inflationary pressures, have been in a tightening mode, despite slowing growth. The exchange rate of the rand depreciated markedly since the previous meeting of the MPC, contributing significantly to the deterioration in the inflation forecast. Since 4 the previous meeting, the rand has depreciated by 13,5 per cent against the US dollar, by 15,2 per cent against the euro, and by 12,9 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The muted reaction of the exchange rate to the start of US Fed normalisation suggested that this move was more or less priced in, but this was overshadowed by the impact of domestic developments on the exchange rate earlier in the month. In early January, the rand reacted further to growing concerns about the outlook for the Chinese economy. While most emerging market currencies were affected, since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand's depreciation has been in excess of most of its emerging market peers. Other indicators such as widening credit spreads and the sharp increase in domestic bond yields point to a higher risk premium attached to South African assets. Although at current levels the rand may appear to be undervalued, divergences from equilibrium can persist for some time. Furthermore, the current account adjustment remains slow, with the deficit expected to widen further in the face of continued weakness in commodity prices and higher drought-induced agricultural imports. The financing of the deficit will also be more challenging in an environment of persistent capital outflows from emerging markets. Since the previous meeting, non-residents have been net sellers of South African bonds and equities. From a monetary policy perspective, a key risk to the inflation outlook is not only the possibility of further depreciation, but also the extent to which the there is a change in the pass-through dynamics, which have been relatively muted in recent years. The domestic economic growth outlook remains weak, with further downward revisions to the Bank's forecast. Growth in 2015 is estimated to have averaged around 1,3 per cent, and is expected to moderate to 0,9 per cent in 2016, before 5. Growth in 2015 is estimated to have averaged around 1,3 per cent, and is expected to moderate to 0,9 per cent in 2016, before 5 accelerating to 1,6 per cent in 2017. This compares with the previous forecast of 1,5 per cent and 2,1 per cent for 2016 and 2017. The Bank's estimate of potential output growth was revised down from 1,9 per cent to 1,5 per cent for 2016, and from 2,1 per cent to 1,6 per cent for 2017. Although there was a marginal increase in the Bank's leading business cycle indicator in November, the trend remains negative, consistent with the subdued outlook. The RMB/BER business confidence index declined further in the fourth quarter of 2015, to its lowest level in five years. High frequency data indicate that the mining sector remains under pressure in the face of declining commodity prices and weak demand. Despite a recovery in the third quarter, the manufacturing sector outlook remains negative. Capacity utilisation has declined further and the Barclays PMI, which has remained well below the neutral level for some months, is consistent with a contraction in the fourth quarter. The continuing drought also means that near-term respite for the agricultural sector is unlikely. Underlying this growth outlook is the continued low growth in gross fixed capital formation, with private sector investment contracting in the third quarter. The prospects for formal sector employment growth therefore remains bleak: the Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa reports static employment levels over the four quarters to the third quarter of 2015. Growth in consumption expenditure by households also moderated in the third quarter, with contractions in spending on durable and non-durable goods. Domestic motor vehicle sales reflected this weakness although recent retail sales data, particularly with respect to semi-durable goods, suggest there may have been a modest improvement in the final quarter of last year. However, the decline in the 6. However, the decline in the 6 FNB/BER consumer confidence index in the fourth quarter of 2015 to a fourteen year low suggests that household consumption expenditure is likely to remain constrained. Credit extension to households has increased marginally recently, particularly with respect to mortgage and general loans. However, these increases remain low and negative in real terms, while instalment sale credit continues to slow. Tighter National Credit Act Regulations related to affordability assessments became effective from September, and are expected to constrain credit to households further. While credit extension to corporates remains robust, it is relatively narrow-based, and reflects in part increased demand for mortgage loans by property funds. Wage and salary trends continue to contribute to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. Year-on-year growth in nominal salaries and wages, while lower in the third quarter of last year, was still above the upper end of the inflation target range. After adjusting for labour productivity increases, growth in total unit labour costs slowed marginally to 5,0 per cent in the third quarter. Andrew Levy Employment Publications reported an average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements of 7,7 per cent in 2015. Food prices remain a significant risk to the inflation outlook. The surge in agricultural commodity prices since early 2015 is beginning to impact on consumer food price inflation, and these pressures are likely to increase in the light of the persistent drought and the weaker exchange rate. This is despite continued moderation in global food prices. Although previous forecasts had incorporated an expectation of higher food price inflation, recent adverse developments have resulted in a further 7. Although previous forecasts had incorporated an expectation of higher food price inflation, recent adverse developments have resulted in a further 7 deterioration of the Bank's food price forecast, which is now expected to peak at around 11 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year. International oil prices have declined to multi-year lows since the previous MPC meeting. The global oversupply and consequent low prices are expected to persist in the short term, particularly following the lifting of sanctions against Iran. But with marginal producers expected to shut down or reduce production, prices are expected to follow a moderate upward trend over the forecast period. The impact of this upward trend on domestic petrol prices has contributed to the higher inflation forecast in 2017 in particular. The potentially favourable impact of the international oil price decline on domestic petrol prices has been more or less offset by the depreciation of the rand. Petrol prices have declined only marginally since November, and the current under-recovery suggests a possible increase of around 7 cents per litre in February. Previously the Committee expressed concerns about the growing risks to the inflation outlook, mainly due to exchange rate and food price risks. These risks appear to be materialising and have contributed to the significant deterioration of the inflation forecast. The intensity of the drought has brought about a sizeable revision to the Bank's food price outlook, while the exchange rate has depreciated significantly more than expected. While oil prices have a moderating impact on the inflation outlook in the near term, base effects and the assumed upward trajectory contribute to the adverse inflation outlook in 2017. The forecast also incorporates changes in administered prices, in particular for water, while an upside risk remains regarding electricity tariff increases. 8 The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be relatively balanced. While there may be potential for further rand weakness in the short-term given the negative outlook for emerging markets in general as well as domestic factors, the lower observed exchange rate pass-through remains a mitigating factor. However, there is still uncertainty as to the sustainability of this low pass-through, particularly in the face of large nominal exchange rate movements as recently experienced. The upside risk from the exchange rate is more or less offset by the downside risks from the international oil price assumptions and projected food price inflation. Demand pressures remain constrained, and the focus of the MPC will therefore be on the evolution of inflation expectations and indications of second-round effects of the exogenous shocks to the inflation outlook. There are some indications that inflation expectations may have deteriorated, but the extent of this will become more evident in the coming surveys. The trend in core inflation provides some indication of the possible emergence of second-round effects. Although core inflation has remained relatively contained in recent months, it is expected to accelerate and to exceed the upper end of the inflation target range for some time in response to exchange rate and wage pressures. The Committee faced the continuing dilemma of a deteriorating inflation environment and a worsening growth outlook. The risks to the growth outlook are assessed to be on the downside, despite the downward revision to the forecast. Given the deterioration in the inflation outlook, the MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 6,75 per cent per annum, effective from 29 January 2016. Three members supported a 50 basis point increase, two members preferred a 25 basis point increase, while one member preferred no change. 9 The MPC still views the stance of monetary policy to be accommodative. Despite the rate increase, the real repurchase rate remains low given the higher expected inflation over the period. The MPC will remain focused on its core mandate of containing inflation within a flexible inflation targeting framework. As noted on a number of occasions in the past, the MPC is of the view that the growth constraints facing the economy are primarily of a structural nature and cannot be solved solely by monetary policy. Nevertheless, the MPC remains sensitive, to the extent possible, to the possible negative impact of monetary policy actions on cyclical growth. As before, future moves will be highly data dependent.

Colombia,2016-01-29,"Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 6.0%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. Annual consumer inflation in December stood at 6.77%, and the average of core inflation indicators posted at 5.43%. Measures of inflation expectations increased: those of analysts to one and two years registered 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively, while those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years are above 4.5%. The increase in inflation in 2015 is mainly explained by the partial transmission of nominal depreciation to consumer prices, and by a strong increase in food prices. The magnitude of the depreciation of the peso and the intensity of El Nino will slow down convergence of inflation to the target, due to its direct impact on prices and inflation expectations, as well as by the probable triggering of indexation mechanisms. The most recent figures of economic activity suggest that output growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 would have been similar to that recorded in the third quarter. The dynamism of consumption and investment would have been lower, but net exports would have contributed positively to growth. For all of 2015, economic growth is projected at 3.0% as the most likely figure, within a range between 2.8% and 3.2%. The technical staff of Banco de la Republica forecasts output growth in 2016 within a range from 1.5% to 3.2%, with 2.7% as the most likely outcome. This figure reflects a domestic demand that would continue adjusting to the lower national income. The highest observed level of the exchange rate would be a stimulus for the production of exportable goods and services, and would lead to substitution of imported goods by local production. This is consistent with the projected reduction of the current account deficit from levels close to USD 19 billion in 2015 to USD 16 billion in 2016. The average growth of the country's main trade partners remains weak. It is expected that the US economy in 2016 will expand at a pace similar to that of 2015, driven by domestic demand. The euro zone would continue its slow recovery. China would grow less, while economic activity in the main Latin American countries would maintain low growth or contraction of their output. Thus, it is feasible that in 2016 the external demand for Colombian products would grow more than in 2015, but at a slower pace than forecast one quarter ago. In the United States, it is likely that additional, gradual increases of the FED's benchmark interest rate will take place. The price of oil continued to decline, reaching levels lower than had been estimated for 2016. This decline implies a further deterioration in the terms of trade and, therefore, of the country's national income. In this environment, and with the beginning of a gradual tightening of the monetary policy in the United States, the country's risk premium increased again, while the peso continued to depreciate vis--vis the US dollar. In synthesis, higher-than-expected increases in food prices and further increases in the exchange rate, related largely to the fall in the price of oil, continue exerting inflationary pressures. At the same time, inflation expectations remain high and the risk of a slowdown in domestic demand, exceeding that which is consistent with the decline in national income, continues to be moderated. In order to ensure convergence of inflation to the target range in 2017, the Board of Directors decided to continue the path of its 25 bp increases of the benchmark interest rate. The Board reiterates its commitment to the inflation target and continues to monitor the behavior and projections of economic activity and inflation in the country carefully, as well as that of asset markets and the international situation.

Russia,2016-01-29,"On 29 January 2016, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep its key rate at 11.00% p.a. On the backdrop of yet another oil price slump, monthly consumer price growth rates stabilised at a high level, with a higher risk of accelerated inflation. The deterioration in the global commodity markets will require a further adjustment of the Russian economy. On the strength of today's decision, the Bank of Russia estimates annual inflation to decrease to a point below 7% as early as January 2017 so it reaches the 4% target by late 2017. Should inflation risks amplify, the Bank of Russia cannot rule out a tightening of its monetary policy. The time period since the Bank of Russia Board meeting in December saw risks to price stability escalating. The stubborn glut of oil, the slowing Chinese economy, combined with the US Federal Reserve rate hike, have triggered a further drop in the price of crude. This, in its turn, caused the national currencies to weaken and asset prices to drop in emerging markets, affecting Russia. With more volatility in oil prices, the magnitude of variation in Russian financial asset prices and the ruble exchange rate fluctuation has increased. The recent weakening of the ruble is putting pro-inflationary pressure and causes inflation expectations to grow, despite a slowdown in annual inflation. According to Bank of Russia estimates, the annual growth rate of consumer prices is set to drop from 12.9% for December 2015 to approximately 10% for January 2016. This slowdown in annual inflation is in line with the previous forecasts. The Bank of Russia expects consumer prices in 1Q 2016 to grow 8-9% against the same period last year. There are risks that inflation in 2Q 2016 may accelerate, caused by, among other factors, the low base effect. Thereafter, annual consumer price growth rate is set to resume its decline. This should occur on the back of, inter alia, reduced inflation expectations and the Bank of Russia's monetary policy. According to the Bank of Russia estimate, on the strength of today's decision, inflation is set to decrease to a point below 7% as early as January 2017 so it reaches the 4% target by late 2017. However, the risks have grown that inflation may deviate from the target in late 2017. The key rate decision has been made in recognition of the current economic situation, with elevated risks of continued recession provoked by falling oil prices. The high debt load of Russian companies and interest rate risks for banks and their borrowers have also been factored in. In 2016-2017, oil prices are likely to be lower than forecast previously in the baseline scenario. The floating exchange rate will partially offset the negative impact of energy prices on the economy. However, the balance of payments and the economy will have to be further adjusted to lower global prices for the key Russian exports. This will result in a more sizable GDP contraction in 2016 than forecast previously in the baseline scenario. The additional adjustment may take several quarters. The GDP growth rate will enter positive territory in 2017, but will be low. However, should oil prices remain persistently low, this will further escalate inflation and financial stability risks and will require a more extensive adjustment of the economy to the new conditions. A continued persistence of high inflation expectations may also hamper the slowdown of consumer price growth. A well-balanced fiscal policy will be required to mitigate these risks in the medium term. Should inflation risks amplify, the Bank of Russia cannot rule out a tightening of its monetary policy. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 18 March 2016. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Pakistan,2016-01-30,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement January 30, 2016 The major macroeconomic indicators continued to exhibit improvements in the first half of the current fiscal year. The inflationary environment stayed benign. LSM gained traction, and fiscal consolidation remained on track. In addition, successful completion of ninth review under IMF's EFF and disbursements from multilateral and bilateral sources added on to country's external buffers. With the pickup in private sector credit, for fixed investment in particular, along with improving security situation reflects strengthening of investor and consumer confidence. Average CPI inflation has declined to. percent during July-December 2015, with perishable food items and motor fuel leading the way. Meanwhile trend in YoY CPI inflation has reversed; it rose for third consecutive month to. percent in December 2015. Keeping in view the benign outlook of global commodity prices, expectation of moderate pickup in domestic demand and further ease in supply side constraints. SBP expects the average inflation in FY16 to remain in the range of to percent. However global oil price trends and excess domestic food stocks (wheat, rice, and sugar) may exert downward pressures on inflation. Large-scale manufacturing (LSM) grew by. percent during Jul-Nov FY16 as compared to. percent in the same period last year. LSM mainly benefitted from monetary easing, falling international prices of key inputs, better energy situation, increased domestic demand for consumer durables, and expansion of construction activities. There are challenges to overall economic performance from the declines in the production of cotton and rice. However part of these losses could be offset by better performance of other crops, especially from the upcoming wheat crop. In view of these developments, real GDP is set to maintain the previous year's growth momentum. The uptick in economic activity appears to continue beyond FY16 on the back of energy and infrastructure projects under CPEC. Pakistan's overall balance of payment position continued to strengthen in H1-FY16. The external current account deficit narrowed down to almost half of the last year's level on account of persistent decline in international oil price and steady growth in workers' remittances. In the capital and financial accounts, besides strong official inflows, there is some improvement in foreign direct investment. Given depressed outlook of international commodity prices, the external current account deficit is expected to remain lower than last year. With continuation of the IMF Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN EFF and expected disbursements from other official sources, the surplus in capital and financial accounts may increase in the second half of FY16. These are expected to have favorable impact on foreign exchange reserves. Furthermore expected increase in FDI from China may help maintain an upward trajectory in foreign exchange reserves. Reversing of trends in exports, however, is dependent on external demand and cotton prices in international market. In addition, easing of domestic constraints with the completion of ongoing energy projects could help in improving export competitiveness. Fiscal deficit was contained to. percent of GDP during Q1-FY16, compared to. percent in the same period last year. This reduction, despite substantial increase in development expenditures during Q1-FY16, was due to improvement in tax revenues and containment of current expenditures. The improvement in fiscal accounts may continue in the remaining months of FY16. While additional tax measures announced in October 2015 are expected to contribute to growth in FBR revenues, current spending is likely to remain within target. The year-on-year growth in broad money (M2) accelerated largely due to substantial increase in Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the banking system. The growth in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the banking system decelerated despite pickup in private sector credit. On the liability side, deceleration in growth of deposits and acceleration in currency in circulation are source of concern. The credit to private sector increased by Rs339. billion during H1-FY16 as compared to the Rs224. billion in same period last year. The impact of monetary easing, improved financial conditions of the major corporate sector and better business environment encouraged firms to avail credit not only for working capital requirements but also for fixed investments. Going forward, the improvements in LSM, expansion plans announced by major industries and favorable monetary conditions are expected to provide continued momentum in the demand for credit. Some stress in liquidity noticed in Q1-FY16 due to increased government borrowing from the scheduled banks steadily eased in Q2-FY16 owing to improved revenue collection and timely receipt of foreign flows. Besides this, pressures in foreign exchange market also induced volatility in interbank liquidity requirements. This is also evident from movements in overnight repo rate which mostly remained slightly above the SBP target rate. Given the above macroeconomic considerations, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the State bank of Pakistan has decided to keep the Policy Rate unchanged at. percent. Page."

India,2016-02-02,"Sixth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2015-16 By Dr.Raghuram G. Rajan. Governor Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.75 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liability (NDTL); continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 14-day term repos as well as longer term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily variable rate repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 7.75 per cent. Assessment 2. Since the fifth bi-monthly statement of December 2015, global growth has slowed, with the ongoing weakening of activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) outweighing the recovery in some advanced economies (AEs). World trade has remained subdued, held down by anaemic demand, new lows in commodity prices and currency realignments. In the United States, an improving labour market continues to support a consumption-led recovery. Manufacturing activity is sluggish, however, reflecting retrenchment in oil and gas drilling activity and declining exports. In the Euro area, improving labour market and financing conditions are supporting consumer spending and business investment. Although core inflation and wage growth are subdued, deflation risks appear to be receding. In Japan, the combination of exceptional monetary accommodation and fiscal stimulus has failed to spur sustainable domestic demand so far. In China, growth in Q4 of 2015 was the slowest since 2009, pulled down by manufacturing, residential investment and exports. EME commodity exporters confront recessionary conditions, falling currencies, sluggish exports and still high inflation relative to their recent histories.2 3. The December calm in global financial markets  suggesting that the normalisation of US monetary policy was fully anticipated  was dispelled in January 2016 by fears of further weakening of the Chinese economy and the depreciation of the Renminbi. Capital outflows from China triggered sell-offs across AEs and EMEs, exacerbating currency declines and heightening volatility. Crude oil prices fell below US $ 30 per barrel  a 12-year low on expectations of Iran adding to the supply glut. Prices of gold prices and US Treasuries hardened on safe haven demand. Financial markets remain vulnerable to bouts of volatility and capital outflows from EMEs as an asset class. Bearish commodity price dynamics are also likely to impact investor sentiment. On the domestic front, economic activity lost momentum in Q3 of 2015-16, pulled down by slackening agricultural and industrial growth. The north-east monsoon season ended in December with a deficiency of 23 per cent relative to the long period average (LPA). By end-January, rabi sowing was mildly deficient relative to a year ago, as well as to the quinquennial average in respect of all crops, except coarse cereals. Rural incomes will continue to be supported by allied activities such as dairy and horticulture, which now contribute as much to GDP as food grains. In the first two months of Q3 of 2015-16, industrial activity slowed in relation to the preceding quarter. This mainly reflects weak investment demand with some deceleration of capital goods production. Stalled projects continue to remain high, and there is a decline in new investment intentions, perhaps on the back of low capacity utilization. While revenue growth in manufacturing has been modest, the fall in costs, partly because of a decline in commodity prices, and partly because of improvements in manufacturing efficiency, have resulted in relatively stronger profitability. The Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey suggests a modest expansion of activity likely in Q4. In January 2016, the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) expanded to a four-month high on, inter alia, resumption of output by firms affected by the December floods as well as on new domestic and export orders. Lead indicators of the services sector are mixed. Construction activity is still tepid, as evidenced by weak growth in cement production, though the pick-up in road construction bodes well for future activity, especially if supported by construction in the major proposed industrial corridors. Railway freight growth is still weak, though it may reflect lower transport needs for inputs like coal, and competition from roadways. However, the services PMI rose to a ten-month high in December on improvement in new business orders and upbeat expectations. Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose for the fifth month in December across all constituent categories. While the upturn in December essentially reflected unfavourable base effects, the ongoing seasonal decline in prices of fruits and vegetables could temper headline inflation in the near-term. Prices of cereals recorded modest increases despite the adverse monsoon, indicative of effective supply management. On the other hand, pulses inflation continued to remain elevated, reflecting structural mismatches. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel rose for the fourth successive month. Excluding petrol and diesel from this category, inflation remained flat. A breakdown into goods and services categories shows that while goods inflation declined, services inflation has been sticky since September 2015 across housing, transport and communication, medical and other services. Household inflation expectations3 remain elevated and the rate of increase in corporate staff costs picked up. On the other hand, rural wage growth has been muted. Liquidity conditions tightened in the second half of December with advance tax outflows. Tightness spilled over into January 2016 on the back of a seasonal pick-up in demand for currency, restrained spending by the government and a pick-up in bank credit growth, in relation to deposit mobilisation. In order to mitigate these conditions, the Reserve Bank injected liquidity through variable rate term repos of varying tenors ranging from overnight to 56 days, besides provision through the regular liquidity windows. The average daily liquidity injection (including variable rate overnight and term repos) increased from 1,200 billion in December to about 1,345 billion in January. In addition, the Reserve Bank also injected 200 billion through open market purchase operations on December 7 and January 20. In response, money market rates remained close to the policy rate with a marginal downside bias. Bank credit in the form of personal loans and non-bank flows from both domestic and foreign sources grew strongly. India's exports remained in contraction mode for the thirteenth successive month in December, although there are indications of a sequential bottoming out. In volume terms too, the rate of decline appears to be moderating. While softer petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) and commodity prices helped to contain the trade deficit, these benign effects were offset by a spike in the quantum of gold and POL imports. As a consequence, the trade deficit widened during December in relation to preceding months, though the overall current account deficit is likely to remain well contained and easily financed. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) and non-resident deposits have remained robust in relation to last year. The persisting decline in oil prices may, however, impact the flow of remittances from the Gulf region where fiscal positions are deteriorating rapidly. Portfolio investment also recorded some outflows since November. Nevertheless, as on January 22, 2016, foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 347.6 billion  an accretion of US$ 5.9 billion during the current financial year so far. Policy Stance and Rationale 11. Inflation has evolved closely along the trajectory set by the monetary policy stance. With unfavourable base effects on the ebb and benign prices of fruits and vegetables and crude oil, the January 2016 target of 6 per cent should be met. Going forward, under the assumption of a normal monsoon and the current level of international crude oil prices and exchange rates, inflation is expected to be inertial and be around 5 per cent by the end of fiscal 2016-17 (Chart 1). However, the implementation of the VII Central Pay Commission award, which has not been factored into these projections, will impart upward momentum to this trajectory for a period of one to two years. The Reserve Bank will adjust the forecast path as and when more clarity emerges on the timing of implementation. Vagaries in the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon and the impact of adverse geo-political events on commodity prices and financial markets add additional uncertainty to the baseline.4 12. Prospects for the rabi harvest are improving slowly. The near-term outlook for industrial activity may be constrained by adverse base effects in Q4 and still weak exports, although the pick-up in corporate profitability on the back of declining input costs may provide an offset. Some categories of services are likely to gain momentum on expectations of higher activity in coming months, though the aggregate state of activity remains muted. On balance, therefore. GVA growth for 2015-16 is kept unchanged at 7.4 per cent with a downside bias. For 2016-17, growth is expected to strengthen gradually, notwithstanding significant headwinds. Expectations of a normal monsoon after two consecutive years of rainfall deficiency, the large positive terms of trade gain, improving real incomes of households and lower input costs of firms should contribute to strengthening the growth momentum. Yet, still weak domestic private investment demand in a phase of balance sheet adjustments, re-emergence of concerns relating to stalled projects, excess capacity in industry, sluggish external demand conditions dampening export growth could act as headwinds. Based on an assessment of the balance of risks. GVA growth for 2016-17 is projected at 7.6 per cent (Chart 2).5 14. In keeping with the Government's Start-up India initiative, the Reserve Bank will take steps to ease doing business and contribute to an ecosystem that is conducive for growth of start-ups. These measures will create an enabling framework for receiving foreign venture capital, differing contractual structures embedded in investment instruments, deferring receipt of considerations for transfer of ownership, facilities for escrow arrangements and simplification of documentation and reporting procedures. A detailed statement is being issued separately. The current momentum of growth is reasonable, though below what should be expected over the medium term. Underlying growth drivers need to be rekindled to place the economy durably on a higher growth trajectory. The revival of private investment, in particular, has a crucial role, especially as the climate for business improves and fiscal policy continues to consolidate. The Indian economy is currently being viewed as a beacon of stability because of the steady disinflation, a modest current account deficit and commitment to fiscal rectitude. This needs to be maintained so that the foundations of stable and sustainable growth are strengthened. The Reserve Bank continues to be accommodative even as it leaves the policy rate unchanged in this review, while awaiting further data on the development of inflation. Structural reforms in the forthcoming Union Budget that boost growth while controlling spending will create more space for monetary policy to support growth, while also ensuring that inflation remains on the projected path of 5 per cent by the end of 2016-17. The first bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2016-17 will be announced on Tuesday. April 5, 2016. Alpana Killawala Press Release : 2015-2016/1807 Principal Adviser."
Georgia,2016-02-03,"03.02.16 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate unchanged at 8.0% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on February 3, 2016 and decided to keep the refinancing rate at 8.0 percent. The monetary policy decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, according to which the tightening of monetary policy by the National Bank of Georgia during 2015 on the one hand will be reflected in the reduced inflation expectations as well as it will weaken inflationary pressure through constraining the aggregate demand. According to the current forecast, in the beginning of 2016 the inflation rate will slightly exceed inflation target; it will decline below 5 percent afterwards, although will remain close to target. The y-o-y growth of consumer prices is 5.6% in January. The main factors of inflation are stemming from the supply side, namely the increase in the intermediate costs of production due to exchange rate depreciation and higher prices on certain imported goods. An important impact on the inflation came from the one-time increase in the electricity tariff. The rise in inflation has been limited by the weak aggregate demand and decrease in the world prices of oil and food products. The real GDP growth in the second quarter was consistent with the forecasts. According to preliminary estimates the real growth in 2015 was 2.8%. The factor hindering the growth is the external sector, which, given the dire economic situation in the region negatively affects the income from exports of goods and services. The economic growth in the past period was mostly driven by domestic demand, although the demand is negatively affected by the decline in remittances and increase in the debt service of foreign currency denominated loans due to the changes in the GEL/USD exchange rate. There have been some positive developments in relation to the elimination of external imbalance. Given the decrease in foreign currency inflows the change in the exchange rate has caused import to adjust. In 2015 the import has decreased by 15.3 percent (excluding the one-offs). Accordingly based on our judgment the impact of the external shock on the exchange rate has been exhausted. Other things equal no additional pressure can be expected on the exchange rate coming from the existing external shock. The tightening of the monetary policy in 2015 is partly reflected to the economy. Interest rates on lari denominated loans increased and as a result the growth of credit portfolio declined. This will be weakening aggregate demand further and will push inflation downwards. Thus, at this stage, there is no need for additional monetary tightening to contain inflation expectations, unless more shocks take place. Accordingly, taking into account external risks and domestic factors, the MPC finds it appropriate to leave the policy rate unchanged at 8.0 percent. Further changes in monetary policy will depend on the inflation forecast and factors affecting it, global and regional economic environment and general economic conditions. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on March 9, 2016."
Poland,2016-02-03,"Warsaw, 3 February 2016 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 2-3 February 2016 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 1.50%;  lombard rate at 2.50%;  deposit rate at 0.50%;  rediscount rate at 1.75%. In the euro area economic recovery continues, yet activity growth remains moderate. In the United States  despite slightly weaker recent data  good economic conditions prevail and GDP growth in 2016 is expected to be close to last year's level. In China, economic growth has been decelerating gradually, while Russia and Brazil remain in a deep recession. Concerns have increased that economic growth in emerging market economies might weaken further, which is a key downside risk to global economic conditions. In consequence, prices of many financial assets have declined in the global markets. This was accompanied by a weakening of emerging market currencies, including the zloty. Prices of oil and other energy commodities remain low. In effect, inflation in many economies  including the euro area  stays close to zero. At the same time, in some advanced economies  including the United States  core inflation is markedly higher than headline consumer price growth. Against this background, the monetary policies in the United States and the euro area are diverging. The ECB continues its financial asset purchases and indicates that the scale of monetary expansion might be increased in the coming months. At the same time, the Federal Reserve's interest rates are still expected to increase. In Poland, preliminary estimate of national accounts for 2015 suggests that GDP growth likely increased in 2015 Q4. Domestic demand, fuelled by stable consumption growth and rising investment, continues to be the key driver of economic growth. Growth is supported by favourable labour market conditions, positive consumer sentiment, sound financial standing of enterprises and high capacity utilisation. As the output gap remains negative, and wage growth is only moderate, currently there are no inflationary pressures in the economy. The annual growth in both consumer and producer prices remains negative. Yet, the persistence of deflation results mainly from the strong fall in global energy commodity prices in recent quarters. Inflation expectations are still very low. However, the persisting deflation has not yet adversely affected decisions of economic agents. In the Council's assessment. CPI inflation will remain negative in the coming months due to the depressed prices of global energy commodities. At the same time, a gradual increase in core inflation is expected and will be supported by stable economic growth amid improving economic activity in the euro area and favourable labour market conditions. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, assessing that  given the available data and forecasts  the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and ensure macroeconomic balance. A more comprehensive assessment of the outlook for price developments and economic growth in the coming quarters will be possible after the Council gets acquainted with the March projection of inflation and GDP."
Thailand,2016-02-03,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 3 February 2016 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 3 February 2016 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. Key considerations for policy deliberation are as follows. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Thai economy gradually recovered at a pace close to the assessment at the previous meeting, supported by high disbursement of public expenditure, an improving number of tourist arrivals, especially Chinese tourists, and continued expansion in private consumption. The improvement in private consumption expenditure was due partly to a temporary effect of the government's tax rebate measure around the end of last year, as well as accelerated car purchases prior to the increase in vehicle excise tax. Meanwhile merchandise export value contracted markedly. Inflationary pressure declined further from the previous meeting due mainly to a sharp and larger-than-expected fall in global oil prices, causing inflationary risks to skew more towards the downside. Nevertheless headline inflation is projected to rise gradually and likely turn positive during the first half of 2016. Meanwhile deflationary risks remain contained as demand continues to expand and core inflation is still positive, consistent with medium-term inflation expectations of the public. Under the Committee's assessment, the Thai economy is projected to expand in 2016 at a rate close to the assessment at the previous meeting, supported mainly by domestic demand. Meanwhile external risks increased from major trading partners' economies, shifting global trade structure, and low commodity prices. In addition, monetary policy divergence among advanced economies continues to influence capital flows and exchange rate movements. In deliberating monetary policy, the Committee judged that monetary policy remained accommodative, and the policy space should be preserved, while being mindful of risks to financial stability. Therefore the policy rate should be kept on hold at this meeting. Nevertheless the Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments closely, and stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to support the economic recovery, while ensuring financial stability."
Czech Republic,2016-02-04,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the Czech National Bank still stands ready to intervene automatically, i.e. without the need for an additional decision of the Bank Board, and without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016. According to the forecast, inflation will increase, hitting the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon (i.e. in the first half of next year) and then moving slightly above it. According to the forecast, sustainable fulfilment of the target, which is a condition for a return to conventional monetary policy, will occur in the first half of 2017. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the new forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being broadly balanced. A need to maintain expansionary monetary conditions at least to the current extent persists. In view of the above, discontinuation of the exchange rate commitment earlier than assumed by the forecast, i.e. at the start of 2017, can now be ruled out. The Bank Board therefore states that the Czech National Bank will not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017. The Bank Board considers it likely that the commitment will be discontinued in the first half of next year. As regards the assumptions of the forecast regarding the external environment, growth in economic activity in the euro area will accelerate slightly further this year and fluctuate around 2% over the entire forecast horizon. Industrial producer prices in the euro area are still falling, owing mainly to a continuing drop in energy commodity prices. Foreign industrial producer prices are thus not expected to return to annual growth before the end of this year, i.e. later than assumed in the previous forecast. The currently low consumer price inflation in the euro area will increase gradually owing to rising demand and the unwinding of the effect of the slump in oil prices, and will approach 2% next year. The European Central Bank responded to the subdued inflation by further easing monetary policy. This is reflected in the outlook for three-month Euribor rates. The Brent crude oil price fell sharply again in late 2015 and early 2016. According to market outlooks it should start rising slowly, but its outlook has been revised downwards markedly over the entire horizon compared to the previous forecast. At the same time, a further slight depreciation of the euro against the US dollar is expected. Domestic headline inflation fell further in 2015 Q4, approaching zero. This was due mainly to a halt in food price growth and a deeper decline in fuel prices. According to the forecast, renewed food price growth and a moderation of the decline in fuel prices will contribute to a renewed increase in inflation already in early 2016. The domestic economy will continue to foster higher costs and consequently higher consumer prices, mainly via accelerating wage growth. At the same time, the current strongly anti-inflationary effect of import prices, stemming from a fall in producer prices in the euro area and in global commodity prices, will fade gradually. According to the forecast, headline inflation will thus increase, hitting the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon and then moving slightly above it. Monetary policy-relevant inflation, i.e. inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, will follow a similar path to headline inflation, although it will be slightly lower owing to the impact of increases in excise duty on tobacco products. Core inflation, i.e. adjusted inflation excluding fuels, will continue to rise gradually, approaching 2% next year. The growth of the Czech economy accelerated further in 2015 Q3, driven by all components of domestic demand, especially fixed investment and household consumption. The economy also recorded robust growth in the rest of last year. According to a CNB estimate. GDP thus increased by 4.7% in 2015 as a whole. According to the forecast, the growth of the Czech economy will slow markedly this year because of a temporary decline in gross capital formation due mainly to a drop in government investment financed from EU funds. However, the economy will continue to be supported by easy domestic monetary conditions via the weakened koruna and exceptionally low interest rates. A further decrease in the oil price and rising external demand are also fostering economic growth. Economic growth will pick up slightly again to 3% in 2017, with positive contributions from all components of domestic demand. The continuing economic growth will be reflected in a further improvement in the labour market situation. Employment will continue to rise, albeit at a slowing pace. The decrease in unemployment will continue, although it too will decelerate. Wage growth in the business sector will accelerate further this year and will exceed that in the non-business sector. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of this year. Consistent with the forecast is an increase in market interest rates in 2017. According to the forecast, the return to conventional monetary policy will not result in the exchange rate appreciating sharply to the slightly overvalued level recorded before the CNB started intervening, among other things because the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to the price level and other nominal variables. At the same time, the Bank Board stated that any exchange rate appreciation following the discontinuation of the exchange rate commitment would be dampened, among other things, by hedging of exchange rate risk by exporters during the existence of the commitment, by the closing of koruna positions by financial investors and by possible CNB interventions to mitigate exchange rate volatility. Compared to the previous forecast, the predictions for headline and monetary policy-relevant inflation are lower for the next few quarters owing to the lower inflation observed at the end of the year, a more subdued outlook for foreign producer prices and a further drop in oil prices. The decrease in the predictions is less marked at the monetary policy horizon  i.e. in the first half of 2017  as the direct effect of the oil price decrease will fade and stronger growth in domestic nominal wages will foster higher inflation. The revision of GDP growth compared to the previous forecast is negligible. The assumption of flat market interest rates at their current very low level and the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016 remains unchanged in the forecast. After the exit from the exchange rate commitment, the path of market interest rates is lower in 2017, primarily as a result of the extension of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank."
Romania,2016-02-05,"The NBR Board examined and approved the February 2016 Inflation Report, which will be presented to the public in a press conference scheduled for 9 February 2016. Inflation remained in negative territory at the end of 2015, in line with the projection. Behind this stood mainly the broadening of the scope of the reduced VAT rate to all food items, non-alcoholic beverages and food service activities starting June 2015. The annual inflation rate touched -0.9 percent in December 2015, compared with -1.1 percent in November and the record low of -1.87 percent seen last August. The rise was attributed to the base effects stemming from fuel price movements, faster pick-up in tobacco product prices, as well as the influences of the swifter narrowing of negative output gap and the relative weakening of the local currency. In the absence of the measure on broadening the scope of the reduced VAT rate, the annual inflation rate would have neared 2 percent at year-end, standing inside the ±1 percentage point variation band of the 2.5 percent target. GDP growth gathered momentum in 2015 Q3. The fastest annual rates of increase saw the tertiary and construction sectors (more than 5.5 percent), in contrast to the still modest dynamics in the industrial sector and sharp decline in the agricultural sector. A differential between pay rises and labour productivity gains is manifest in the industrial sector. As for demand, the largest contribution to GDP advance made further final consumption, to which added, this time around, a favourable performance of net exports. In this context, the current account deficit remained below 1 percent of GDP over the first three quarters of 2015, with the wider trade gap being largely offset by an upward path in the services surplus. Interbank rates on the money market and bank rates continued to decrease to new historical lows. Against this background, the annual dynamics of credit to the private sector advanced further into positive territory, due to leu-denominated loans alone. Loans in domestic currency accounted for 50.7 percent of the loan stock at end-2015, compared with a 35.6 percent low in May 2012, benefitting the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and helping mitigate the risks to financial stability. The NBR Board has examined and approved the February 2016 Inflation Report. The new quarterly forecast reconfirms the outlook for inflation to go deeper into negative territory January through May 2016, as a result of the cut in the standard VAT rate and in other indirect taxes. At the same time, the forecast points to the annual inflation rate re-entering the variation band of the target at the beginning of 2017 and remaining there afterwards. This is attributable to the fading out of the transitory disinflationary impact of the standard VAT rate cut, to the easing of the fiscal policy stance and to the rise in unit wage costs. The successive indirect tax cuts in the period from 2015 to 2017 cause the volatility of inflation rate over the projection interval. The risks to the current projection stem primarily from the domestic environment. They are triggered by the uncertainty about the fiscal and income policies, as well as about the implementation of structural reforms, in the context of the elections scheduled to take place this year and in the absence of agreements with international financial institutions. On the external front, particularly relevant is the heightened uncertainty surrounding global economic growth, stemming from the performance of the Chinese economy and of other major emerging economies, with implications on euro area recovery. Adding to this is the uncertainty about developments in international oil prices and the recent spike in global financial market volatility, associated with the increasingly diverging monetary policy stances of the world's major central banks. Under the circumstances, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum, to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system, and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and preserving macroeconomic stability. The NBR Board considers that a balanced economic policy mix and the progress in structural reform implementation are pivotal to preserving macrostability, ensuring lasting economic growth, carrying on convergence with the European Union, as well as enhancing the resilience of the Romanian economy to potential shocks or adverse conditions worldwide. The NBR is closely monitoring both domestic and external economic developments for an adequate use and dosage of all its available tools to fulfil the overriding objective regarding medium-term price stability and preserve financial stability. The new Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 9 February 2016. In line with the calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 31 March 2016.

Philippines,2016-02-10,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy rates at 4.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs and special deposit accounts (SDA) were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's assessment of manageable inflation dynamics and robust growth conditions continue to support steady monetary policy settings. Average inflation is projected to settle within the target range of 3.0 percent ± 1 percentage point for 2016-2017, while inflation expectations remain firmly anchored within the inflation target band over the policy horizon. The Monetary Board also noted that the risks surrounding the inflation outlook have shifted slightly to the downside. Downward pressures on inflation could arise from slower-than-expected global economic activity and potential second-round effects from lower international oil prices, while upside risks could come from the impact of prolonged El Niño dry weather conditions on food prices and utility rates as well as pending petitions for power rate adjustments. At the same time, the Monetary Board observed that domestic demand conditions are likely to stay firm, supported by solid private household and capital spending, buoyant market sentiment, and adequate domestic liquidity. The Monetary Board also considered that the lingering uncertainty over economic growth prospects across the globe could continue to drive volatility in global financial markets. Going forward, the Monetary Board affirmed the continuing need for vigilance over domestic and external developments to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains in line with price and financial stability."
Chile,2016-02-11,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 11 February 2016 Press Release1 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3.5%. Abroad, sovereign risk premiums have risen, most of stock exchanges have intensified their drop and commodity prices have fallen again. The majority of currencies partially reverted their losses with respect to the U.S. dollar that occurred in the previous month. World growth forecasts have been reduced. In this context, some central banks have increased their monetary stimulus or have announced future actions in that direction. Long-term interest rates have decreased in advanced economies. On the domestic front. January's monthly CPI inflation was somewhat higher than expected, and in annual terms remained above 4%. Core inflation—the CPIEFE—is still close to 5% y-o-y. Inflation expectations two years out remain at 3%. The evolution of these variables will continue to be monitored with special attention. Available data during this month continue to show limited growth in domestic output and demand. Confidence indicators are still in pessimistic territory. The annual growth rate of salaried workers showed less dynamism, but the unemployment rate fell again. The annual wage growth kept moderating its pace. The future path of the monetary policy rate considers measured adjustments aimed to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target, at a pace that will depend on incoming information and its implications on inflation. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. 1 The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2016-02-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2016 BCRP RAISES THE POLICY INTEREST RATE TO 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 bps to 4.25 percent. The Board has taken this decision considering a gradual return of inflation to the inflation target range in the forecast horizon, taking into account the following factors: Inflation has been affected by temporary supply factors, such as the rise in the prices of some food products and utilities, as well as by the depreciation of the sol against the dollar. These increases in consumer prices have affected the expected rate of inflation, pushing it above the target range, which can fuel inflation in turn. Local economic activity has been recovering. The global economy continues showing volatility in exchange rates, in stock prices and in commodity prices, with mixed signals of recovery in terms of production and employment in the larger economies. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, including how inflation expectations evolve, to evaluate the convenience of making additional adjustments in the monetary policy rate. Inflation is expected to gradually return again within the target range in a period of time similar to the monetary policy horizon. Inflation in January showed a rate of 0.37 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 4.4 percent in December to 4.6 percent in January. The monthly rate of inflation is explained by the increase observed in the prices of perishable food products and electricity rates. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of -0.07 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation declined from 3.5 percent in December to 3.4 in January. In this month, the rate of inflation expected for 2016 was 3.5 percent and the rate of inflation expected for 2017 was 3.0 percent. Recent indicators of economic activity and business and consumer expectations show an economic cycle with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output levels until the third quarter of 2015, but with a faster pace of growth in the last quarter of the year. In 2016 the economy is foreseen to grow at rates similar to those of the potential output. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to raise the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for March at the Board meeting that will be held on March 10, 2016."
Armenia,2016-02-16,"PRESS RELEASE 16.02.2016 At the February 16, 2016 meeting the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to lower the refinancing rate by 0.25 percentage point to 8.5%. In January of 2016 inflation was 2.2% compared to 2.5% recorded in the same month of the previous year. In the meanwhile the 12-month inflation rate fell slightly, amounting to -0.4% at the end of the month. The low level of inflation is almost entirely due to the decrease in agricultural product prices against the same period last year and the deflationary impact partly transmitted on domestic prices from the external sector. Trends observable in the external sector recently did not change significantly: the global economy grew at a relatively slow pace, while prices in international commodity markets continued reducing. The Board of the CBA estimates that this trend will persist in the coming months, which will continue to have a deflationary impact on domestic prices. Economic growth in 2015 is estimated to be within 3.2%, with agriculture and mining sectors remaining the main drivers to it. The domestic demand remains weak, although the Central Bank and the Government carried out expansionary policies during the year. The Board estimates that significant inflationary pressures from the domestic economy and external sector in the short run are not expected, and a deflationary environment will be maintained. In the current economic situation, a low level of inflation will contribute to maintaining the purchasing power of incomes and gradual decline in inflation expectations. In this circumstance, gradual easing of monetary conditions by the Board of the CBA is appropriate on the premise of relatively high inflation expectations and the risk to downside price rigidity and increasing dollarization. In the upcoming months, the Board of the CBA notes, the inflation environment will remain low; it then will expand gradually driven by considerable loosening of the monetary conditions since 2015 to approach the target in the forecast horizon. The Board of the CBA will look to further easing of the monetary conditions, as expected economic developments unfold and no additional risks emerge in external and internal sectors. More information on the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program. Q1, 2016) to be published on February 26, 2016.

South Korea,2016-02-16,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trends of economic recovery in the US and the euro area have weakened somewhat. Economic growth in emerging market countries including China has meanwhile continued to slow. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that it will be affected by factors such as financial and economic conditions in China and other emerging market countries, international oil price movements, and global financial market volatility. Looking at the Korean economy, the trend of decline in exports has expanded and the recovery of domestic demand activities such as consumption has also shown signs of weakening somewhat, while the sentiments of economic agents have been sluggish. On the employment front, as the trend of increase in the number of persons employed expanded in December, the employment-to-population ratio rose compared to that in December the year before while the unemployment rate fell. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will continue its recovery going forward, centering around domestic demand activities, but in view of external economic conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to have increased. Consumer price inflation fell from 1.3% the month before to 0.8% in January, owing chiefly to the disappearance of the effect of the cigarette price hike, and core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also fell to 1.7%, from 2.4% in December. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the declines in international oil prices. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices slowed in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country. In the domestic financial markets, influenced by global stock market unrest and by foreigners' continuing net sales of domestic securities, stock prices have fallen and the Korean won has depreciated against the US dollar. The won has depreciated even more against the Japanese yen than the US dollar, on the strengthening of the yen due to investor preference for safe assets. Long-term market interest rates have fallen, in response mainly to declines in interest rates in major countries and to the movements of domestic economic and price indicators. Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level substantially exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic growth, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon, and pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as any changes in the monetary policies of major countries or in financial and economic conditions in China, the movements of capital flows, geopolitical risks, and the trend of increase in household debt."
Colombia,2016-02-19,"Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 6.25%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. Annual consumer inflation in January stood at 7.45%, and the average of core inflation indicators posted at 5.73%, surpassing the forecasts of the technical staff at the Central Bank. The measures of inflation expectations remain high: those by analysts to one and two years registered 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively, while those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years are between 4.5% and 5.0%. The increase in food prices as well as the higher nominal depreciation and its partial pass-through to consumer prices explain the increase in inflation in January. Although they are considered temporary shocks, the magnitude of the depreciation of the peso and the intensity of El Nino increase the risk of a slower convergence of inflation to the target, due to its direct impact on prices and inflation expectations as well as by the probable triggering of indexation mechanisms. The price of oil is still volatile and remains below the forecasts for this year. Global risk aversion has increased. In this environment, the largest economies of Latin America recorded once more increases in their risk premia and their currencies depreciated vis--vis the US dollar. The most recent information on global economic activity suggests that in 2015 the average economic growth of Colombia's trading partners was weak, and the forecast for 2016 suggests that its recovery will be somewhat slower than expected. New declines in oil prices continue deteriorating the terms of trade and are reflected in a further fall of the national income and, especially, of public revenue. Given that part of this fall is long-lasting, a permanent adjustment of domestic spending in the economy is required, for which fiscal policy measures are the most effective instrument. In this sense, the announced cuts in public expenditure and the firm commitment of the Government to submit a structural tax reform in 2016 are necessary measures for the economy to adjust to the new income levels. The most recent figures of economic activity suggest that output growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 would have been similar to that recorded in the third quarter. The dynamism of consumption and investment would have been lower, but net exports would have contributed positively to growth. For all of 2015, economic growth is projected at 3.0% as the most likely figure, within a range between 2.8% and 3.2%. In January, the Consumer Confidence Index declined significantly, registering a historically low level. However, uncertainty about the persistence of this low level of the indicator and its impact on household spending is high. Other indicators of economic activity are compatible with the technical staff's growth forecast for 2016 (2.7% as the most likely figure, within a range between 1.5% and 3.2%). In summary, higher-than-expected increases in food prices and further increases in the exchange rate, largely related to the fall in the price of oil, continue exerting upside inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations remain high and an additional pass-through of the devaluation of the peso to domestic prices is foreseeable. The Board of Directors decided to continue with the path of 25 bp increases of the benchmark interest rate, and will be particularly attentive to the behavior of inflation and its expectations in order to ensure convergence of inflation to its target in 2017. At the same time, the cuts announced in public spending and the firm commitment of the National Government to submit a structural tax reform this year, contribute to reduce the current account deficit and inflationary pressures. On the other hand, with the purpose of mitigating the impact of an overreaction of the exchange rate on inflation expectations and contributing to preserve the conditions of liquidity of the foreign exchange market, the Board decided to modify the percentage for the activation of the auction of options to decumulate international reserves and their exercise from 5.0% to 3.0%. The other conditions of the mechanism remained unaltered. The Board reiterates its commitment to the inflation target and continues to carefully monitor the behavior and projections of economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as that of asset markets and the international situation."
Israel,2016-02-22,"Background conditions. Currency (Unit) Rate Daily Change. Nominal Effective Rate -0.085%. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor January declined by 0.5 percent, a slightly more moderate rate than the average of forecasters' predictions for a decline of 0.6 percent. There were seasonal price declines in the clothing and footwear component (-5.7 percent), and the housing component (-0.5 percent), and there was a marked decline (-0.7 percent) in the transport and communication component, against the background of the decline in fuel prices. Inflation over the past 12 months was negative 0.6 percent, compared with negative 1 percent in the 12 months ending in December. Excluding energy prices and administrative price reductions, inflation over the past 12 months was 0.7 percent. Prices of components representing tradable goods in the CPI declined by 2.8 percent over the past 12 months, and the prices of components representing nontradable items increased by 0.7 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market are negative 0.2 percent (similar to the previous month), and expectations derived frombanks' internal interest rates are negative 0.4 percent (compared with negative 0.3 percent last month). Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings are for an increase of 0.4 percent (compared with 0.3 percent in the previous month). Three-year forward expectations declined from 1 percent to 0.9 percent, and are affected by the low level of inflation and by measures to reduce prices in the economy. Medium-term and long-term forward expectations remained anchored within the inflation target range: Medium-term (3-5 years) expectations increased from 1.3 percent to 1.4 percent, while long-term (5 C2 AD-10 years) expectations declined from 2.2 percent to 1.9 percent. The path of the Telbor curve, which in recent months has reflected some probability of an interest rate increase in a year, is currently mostly below the level of the Bank of Israel interest rate. According to the average of projections by private forecasters, some decline in the Bank of Israel interest rate is expected in the next three months, but the rate is expected to increase in about a year. Real economic activity: Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month point to a growth rate similar to that of recent years, with some acceleration of growth in the fourth quarter of 2015. The first estimate of National Accounts data for the fourth quarter (seasonally adjusted in annual terms) indicates that GDP and business sector product grew by 3.3 percent: a higher rate than in the previous quarters of the year. Increased vehicle imports in the fourth quarter of 2015 were reflected in consumption, investment and import data: Private consumption increased by 5.8 percent, while current consumption declined by 0.3 percent. Fixed capital formation (excluding ships and aircraft) increased by 5.5 percent, and civilian imports (excluding ships, aircraft and diamonds) increased by 28.4 percent. Exports (excluding diamonds andstartups) also recorded solid growth of 5.5 percent, and public consumption (excluding defense imports) increased by 10 percent, after no longer being restricted by the transition budget. Foreign trade data for January (in current dollar terms) indicate a decline of 1.3 percent in exports, and of 5.9 percent in imports (excluding ships, aircraft, diamonds, and energy products). The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.2 percent inJanuary, and the readings for previous months were revised upward. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics showed improvement in January, while the index compiled by Bank Hapoalim deteriorated. The Purchasing Managers Index declined again, to 48.1 points, a level indicating a contraction of activity. The effect of the security situation on activity remains moderate: The number of tourists declined in January by 0.9 percent (seasonally adjusted) compared with December, and there was a decline in the private consumption of services in the National Accounts data for the fourth quarter. The labor market: The Labor Force Surveyfor the fourth quarter indicates an entrenchment of employment at a high level. Among the prime working ages (25-64), there was a slight increase in the unemployment rate (4.6 percent compared with 4.5 percent), witha slight decline in the employment rate (76.3 percent compared with 76.4 percent) and in the labor force participation rate (79.9 percent compared with 80.0 percent). Data from the January survey were similar. As is characteristic of an economy with a high level of employment, there has been some increase since the beginning of 2015 in the proportion of those employed in part-time positions. The job vacancy rate declined in January (seasonally adjusted data), but remains high at 3.3 percent. Nominal wages increased by 1.2 percent, and real wages increased by 1.8 percent, in September-November, compared with June-August (seasonally adjusted data). In the past year (September-November 2015 compared with September-November 2014), nominal wages increased by 2.4 percent, compared with 2.1 percent the previous year, while the number of employee posts increased by 2 percent, compared with 3 percent in the previous year. Health tax receipts for November-January were 5.4 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period in the year before. Budget data: The domestic surplus (excluding net credit) in government activity was NIS 4.2 billion in January 2016. The surplus was lower than the seasonal path by about NIS 1.0 billion, asa result of expenditures (in all government ministries) that were about NIS 2 billion higher than the seasonal path, and revenues that were about NIS 1 billion higher than the seasonal path. Tax revenues totaled NIS 27.4 billion in January. NIS 1.4 billion higher than the seasonal path consistent with the estimate of tax revenue. Tax revenue was about 12 percent higher inreal terms than in January of last year (net of the effects of extraordinary activities and legislative changes). The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on January 24, 2016, through February 19, 2016, the shekel strengthened by 1.5 percent against the dollar and by 0.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the preceding 12 months, the shekel appreciated by 2.8 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on January 24, 2016, through February 19, 2016, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 3.1 percent, in line with the global trend. Nominal yields declined sharply along the entire curve by up to 14 basis points, while on the CPI-indexed curve, medium-term yields declined by a slightly more moderate rate. The makam yield curve traded slightly below the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, declined to about 84 basis points. The money supply: In the 12 months ending in January, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demanddeposits) increased by 38.9 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 12.6 percent. The credit market: In January, the nonfinancial business sector issued bonds totaling just NIS 0.6 billion, lower than the average over the past 12 months (about NIS 2.5 billion). Corporate bond spreads increased slightly at the beginning of February, and withdrawals from mutual funds specializing in bonds continued. There were net withdrawals in January of about NIS 4.8 billion from government bond funds, corporate bond funds, and general bond funds. In January, which is generally typified by a relatively low level of mortgages extended, the volume of new mortgages taken out was NIS 4.75 billion. The average share of mortgages taken out for the purpose of purchasing an investment dwelling is on a downwardtrend, to an average of approximately 15.7 percent in 2015, from an average of approximately 17 percent in 2014. The interest rate on new mortgages issued in January increased in all indexation tracks, by between 7 and 21 basis points, continuing the trend that has been apparent since May. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) declined by 0.5 percent in January, after increasing by 0.4 percent in December. In November-December, home prices continued to increase (by 0.7 percent), and their rate of increase in the past year was 8 percent. The number of transactions in December reached a record of about 9,300, and the monthly average in 2015 was 8,250. The stock of new homes available for sale remained stable in December, at approximately 28,100 homes, a number that is similar to the average overthe second half of the past year. The volume of building starts in the past two years indicates that building completions are expected to remain at ahigh level in the coming quarters as well. The global economy: This month, there was a continuation of the trend of moderation in global economic activity: particularly a slowdown in developing economies and in world trade: with further deterioration in financial conditions against the background of concern over the stability of banks worldwide, in general, and in Europe, in particular. Stock market indices were very volatile with an increase in risk indices. The OECD revised its global growth forecast for 2016 downward to 3 percent (a decline of 0.3 percentage points from the previous forecast in November). Likewise, there were downward revisions of the forecasts for the US (by 0.5 percentage points). Europe (0.4 percentage points),and Japan (0.2 percentage points). The forecast for China remained unchanged. In the US, fourth quarter growth was only 0.7 percent (in annual terms), with moderation in the growth rate of personal consumption expenditure and continued weakness in the manufacturing sector. The increase in nonfarm payroll employment was lower than expected, although the unemployment rate reached its lowest level since 2008, and wages increased in the past year by 2.5 percent. The rate of inflation remains low. Markets ascribe a very lowprobability to the Federal Reserve raising the federal funds rate again this year, and while the Fed did not rule out this possibility, the Federal Reserve Chair clarified that global market developments are likely to impacton the path of interest rates. The moderation in Europe was reflected in growth of 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter (compared with the correspondingquarter of the previous year), in contraction of industrial production in January, and in historically low levels of purchasing managers indices. Unemployment continues to decline but its level remains high, at 10.4 percent.Inflation remains low, despite the measures taken by the ECB and the weakness of the euro. In Japan. GDP contracted in the fourth quarter by 1.4 percent and the Bank of Japan reduced the interest rate its pays to commercial banks on deposits to a negative level. Despite that, the yen appreciated sharply. Sweden's central bank further reduced its negative interest rate to -0.5 percent, due to a further decline in the inflation environment. Data on emerging markets continue to indicate weakness, particularly among commodity exporters. Data published in China continue to reflect moderation in the growth rate, primarily in the manufacturing sector. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil continued to fluctuate this month in a range between $28-35. The commodities, excluding energy, index increased byabout 3 percent. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for March 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growthwhile maintaining financial stability. In view of developments in the inflation environment, in growth in Israel and in the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, the Monetary Committee's assessment is that monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. C 2B 7 As expected, the inflation environment remained low this month as well, against the background of price reductions initiated by the government and low energy prices. Inflation expectations up to three years forward, which are slightly below the lower bound of the target range, are influenced by the current low level of inflation and by measures to reduce prices in the economy. Medium- and long-term expectations are anchored within the target range. Further initiated price reductions are expected to be reflected in the next few CPI readings as well. In contrast, wage increases in the economy are expected to support a return of the inflation rate to within the target range. C 2B 7 The indicators of real economic activity that became available this month point to a growth rate similar to that of previous years, and to some acceleration of growth in the fourth quarter of 2015. According to the first estimate of National Accounts data. GDP grew by 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter, with an increase in all uses except for current consumption. Initial indicators for the first quarter of 2016 point to a mixed picture. The effect of the security situation on economic activity remains moderate, and is reflected mainly in tourism. The picture conveyed by labor market data remains positive, and is reflected in a high level of employment with a continued increase in wages, despite some moderation in the jobvacancy rate. C 2B 7 This month, the trend of moderation in global economicactivity continued, in particular a slowdown in developing economies and in world trade, and with a further worsening of financial conditions againstthe background of concern over the stability of banks, particularly in Europe. The markets ascribe a low probability to an additional interest rate increase in the US this year, and a number of central banks have enhanced monetary accommodation. C 2B 7 The nominal effective exchange rate has been relatively stable in recent months. From the monetary policy discussion on January 24, 2016, through February 19, 2016, the shekel strengthened by about 1.5 percent against the US dollar and by 0.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the past 12 months there has been an appreciationof 2.8 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and its level continues to weigh on growth of exports and the tradable sector. C 2B 7 In recent months, the increase in home prices accelerated, and they rose by 8 percent over the past 12 months. The volume of new mortgages taken out remains high, despite the increase in mortgage interest rates in recent months. The elevated level of activity in the constructionindustry is expected to continue to contribute to increasing supply. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to achieving the inflation target and to growth remain high. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for March 2016 will be published on March 7, 2016. The decision regarding the interest rate for April 2016 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. March 28, 2016."
India,2016-02-22,"Summary of the Electronic Consultation with the Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy: January 2016 Consultation with external Members of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Monetary Policy was held electronically during January 19-22, 2016 in the run up to the Sixth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Review, 2015-16 on February 2, 2016. The main points made by Members are set out below. Members expressed concern on global developments. Overall growth in the US in 2016 will slow towards trend, with underlying US domestic economy looking solid. Macroeconomic conditions in Europe are not good  unemployment is elevated, growth is close to 1.5 per cent, and structural reforms in labour and product markets are not happening. Quantitative easing in Europe will not have the same effects as in the US since US equity ownership is more widespread. The essential challenge in Europe is that diverse economies are forced to live with a single exchange rate and single monetary policy. Among emerging market economies (EMEs), the pace of growth in China was the lowest last year since 1990. China has to deal with large debt and excess capacity in several industries such as steel. On domestic growth. Members were of the view that the economy has stabilised, and appears to be on a path of a modest recovery. While the November IIP collapse suggests a slowing down of economic activity (partly also due to festival induced fewer working days), a smoothed average over October-November suggests a slow but gradual revival in economic activity. However, the pace of recovery is constrained by problems in both the banking and infrastructure sectors. This has led to weak private investment. Consumption, somewhat tepid, however, is contributing to demand, although contribution from durables and non-durables is mixed. There are risks in the revival of growth. First, weak data from the corporate sector are getting worse with bad debt concentrated among large corporates (especially in steel and power). Second, stressed corporate balance sheets are pushing capex down, suggesting that private investment is likely to be flat in the short term. Third, even though public investment in 2015-16 increased to compensate private investment, the absorptive capacity of the economy may be limited. On the fiscal front, there has been a significant improvement in fiscal balances, alongside a shift from revenue to capital expenditures, with a general improvement in the aggregate fiscal position of the states.2 3. While most Members felt that the 6 per cent inflation target for January 2016 will be comfortably met, a Member expressed concern on the recent increase in all measures of inflation. Headline CPI prints have gone up from 5 per cent in October to 5.6 per cent in December; food categories have recorded sequential gains with pulses inflation above 40 per cent for three months in succession; inflation in items excluding food and fuel is gathering pace, a gauge that indicates caution in further loosening of monetary policy stance; and the extent of deflation in WPI has slowed. The disinflationary pass-through from lower crude oil prices will be mitigated by the recent nominal depreciation of the rupee, coupled with future increases in excise duties. While the government has managed food inflation well, there were several risks to the evolution of headline and core inflation in the medium term. First, following the implementation of the Seventh Central Pay Commission (7th CPC) recommendations whether the economy will see a wage-price spiral and how this will ultimately affect the labour market in the services sector. It is yet to be seen if the 7th CPC recommendations will be staggered and in which manner. Second, while the fall in commodity prices conveys a weak global economy, and therefore global slack, services inflation continues to be high - inflation from non-tradables, which relates to domestic slack rather than global slack, therefore remains a concern. Third, inflationary expectations continue to show inertia and are elevated - this may be related to the problem of expectation formation being adaptive. On the external sector. Members did not see severe balance of payments risks, although capital outflows were a concern. Recent exchange rate volatility was related to the language coming from the US Federal Reserve on the speed of lift-off from the zero interest rate policy (ZIRP). Faltering growth from China and other EMEs will continue to lead to outflows of capital from EMEs including India, leading to possible downward pressure on the rupee. A strengthening US dollar will make the cost of servicing debt denominated in dollars harder to bear for emerging markets. All measures of volatility  the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, the Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index, and the Merrill Lynch index of anticipated price swings in Treasury Bonds  are on an uptick this year. In India it is manifesting through rupee volatility and surges in gold imports. Members had different views on managing exchange rates  one Member opined that the rupee should be allowed to depreciate, so as to correct the 36-currency REER appreciation over the last year or so; another Member was of the view that the caps on debt flows and shift to longer-run debt will be protective during market stress; yet another Member felt that pushing masala bonds even with a premium to be paid to borrow overseas in the domestic currency requires to be stepped up. For the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy, four of the five Members recommended status quo since, all measures of inflation have increased; the impact of implementing the pay commission recommendations on the evolution of headline and core inflation in the medium term needs to be watched; while the fall in commodity prices convey a weak global economy, high services inflation remains a concern; inflationary expectations continue to show inertia and are elevated; while industry continues to underperform, which along with the fall in external demand justifies taking some measures to stimulate domestic demand, it may be worthwhile to assess supply-side measures and fiscal consolidation efforts outlined in the budget before making a move to cut policy rates; and the real policy rate is slightly below the neutral3 rate suggesting that policy is currently accommodative, rather than neutral. One of these Members was of the view that given the continuing weakness in the domestic economic recovery and the growing signs of further weakness in the international economy, consideration may be given to an out-of-cycle policy rate reduction, synchronized with the Union Budget. Such synchronization could have salutary “confidence effects” on the flagging domestic private investment. The fifth Member recommended a policy repo rate reduction by 50 basis points. All the five external Members  Dr.Shankar Acharya. Dr.Arvind Virmani. Prof. Errol D'Souza. Prof. Ashima Goyal, and Prof. Chetan Ghate  sent their feedback through e-mail. Since February 2011, the Reserve Bank has been placing main points of discussions held with TAC on Monetary Policy in the public domain with a lag of roughly four weeks after the meeting/consultation.

Malaysia,2016-02-22,The international reserves of Bank Negara Malaysia amounted to RM410.2 billion (equivalent to USD95.6 billion) as at 15 February 2016. The reserves position is sufficient to finance 8.2 months of retained imports and is 1.2 times the short-term external debt[1]. Bank Negara Malaysia 22 February 2016.
Turkiye,2016-02-23," The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 7.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports at an increasing pace, despite elevated geopolitical risks in other export markets. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Energy price developments affect inflation favorably, while other cost factors limit the improvement in the core indicators. Considering the wage developments and the impact of the uncertainty in global markets on inflation expectations and pricing behavior and taking into account the volatility in energy and unprocessed food prices, the Committee stated that the tight liquidity stance will be maintained as long as deemed necessary. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2016-03-03,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to leave the discount rate unchanged at 22% per annum. The NBU Board's decision to keep a prudent monetary policy in place aims to stave off any adverse impacts that domestic political instability and global economic turbulence could have on the Ukrainian economy. The decision to keep interest rates unchanged is consistent with the NBU's objective of lowering headline inflation to 12% by the end of 2016 and 8% by the end of 2017. In January 2016, headline inflation stood at 0.9% m-o-m and was broadly in line with the NBU's inflation projections for the month. January's price developments were consistent with the projected disinflation path, envisaging moderation of headline annual inflation to 12% by the end of 2016. Core inflation continued to moderate, standing at zero in January. According to preliminary estimates of the State Statistical Service based on a ten-day monitoring of price developments, annual headline inflation remained low in February 2016. In recent months, inflationary pressures have been dampened by the NBU's commitment to prudent monetary policy and subdued domestic demand. The heightened exchange rate volatility observed in January-February 2016 had a relatively limited impact on the inflation rate. Thanks to the measures taken by the NBU to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility, the hryvnia depreciated in a gradual manner, thus having a limited impact on the inflation rate. The NBU deems it appropriate to keep its headline inflation projection unchanged at 12% by end-2016 and 8% by end-2017. Accordingly, the NBU confirms that its pre-announced mid-term inflation targets remain within reach. Sluggish economic growth, which will continue to weigh on consumer demand, is one of the key factors that will keep inflation firmly on a downward trend in 2016. Low global prices for energy and food are among other factors supporting the downward trend in inflation. At the same time, a sharper decline in inflation will be restrained by the planned upward adjustment of administered prices, which is already reflected in the NBU's inflation forecast. The major downside risks to the inflation forecast and, consequently, the achievement of the NBU's 2016 inflation objective include both external and domestic factors that determine the balance of payments performance, the exchange rate path of the hryvnia, and inflation expectations. While the global markets see tentative signs of stabilizing for prices for key Ukrainian export commodities, other risks are growing. First, it takes a longer time for exporters to shift their focus to new sales markets and find new transport routes for the delivery of their goods. Second. Ukraine faces risks stemming from domestic political turbulence, delays with the resumption of cooperation with the International Monetary Fund, and, consequently, further delays to disbursements of official financing. In view of the abovementioned risks and the NBU's commitment to its price stability objective, the NBU deems it necessary to maintain the current monetary conditions. Going forward, provided that inflationary risks subside, the NBU intends to resume the gradual easing of monetary policy. This can primarily be achieved provided that political stability is restored in the country. Ukraine brings the IMF program back on track, and as long as there are more favorable external conditions for domestic exports. At the same time, should these risks materialize, the NBU will be forced to keep a prudent monetary policy in place for a longer period to achieve its inflation objectives. The decision on the discount rate is approved by NBU Board Resolution No. 135, dated 3 March 2016. On Money Market Regulation. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 21 April 2016, as scheduled."
Georgia,2016-03-09,"09.03.16 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate Unchanged at 8.0%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on March 09, 2016 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 8.0 percent. The monetary policy decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, according to which the tightening of the monetary policy will be reflected positively on the gradual decrease in inflation expectations. According to the forecast, inflation rate will decline after the first quarter of 2016, however it will remain around its target value. The annual growth in consumer prices equaled 5.6% in February. The main factors causing rise in inflation are still coming from the supply side, namely the increase in the debt service burden due to exchange rate depreciation and higher prices on imported goods. An important impact on the inflation came from the one-time factors, such as the increase in the electricity tariff and rise in the excise tax on tobacco and alcohol products. In the coming months, once the aforementioned factors will have been neutralized, the inflation is expected to decline. On the other hand the inflation is limited by the weak aggregate demand and decrease in the world prices of oil and food products. According to preliminary estimates the real growth in January 2016 was 0.8%. The main factor hindering the growth still is the external sector. The dire economic situation in the region negatively affects revenues from export of goods and services. The domestic demand is negatively affected by the decline in remittances and increase in the service burden of foreign currency denominated loans due to the depreciation of the GEL/USD exchange rate. Taking into account the existing forecasts the Monetary Policy Committee deemed that no additional policy tightening is necessary and kept the refinancing rate unchanged at 8.0%. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on April 27, 2016."
Malaysia,2016-03-09,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. The global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. In the advanced economies, growth has been modest and uneven. In most of Asia, domestic demand continues to support economic activity despite the weaker export performance. The international financial markets remain volatile amid shifts in global liquidity and investor sentiments. Looking ahead, while global growth is expected to continue, the outlook is vulnerable to downside risks arising from the prevailing fragilities that are both cyclical and structural, excessive leverage, the sharp declines in commodity prices and the rising geopolitical risks. In this challenging environment, the Malaysian economy is expected to expand at a more moderate pace in 2016 after registering a 5 percent growth in 2015. The prospects are for domestic demand to remain as the key driver of growth. While private consumption is expected to moderate, household spending will continue to be supported by the growth in income and employment, and the additional disposable income from the measures announced during the 2016 Budget Recalibration. Overall investment will continue to be supported by the implementation of infrastructure development projects and capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors. The external sector is expected to record a modest improvement and provide additional support to the economy. For 2016, inflation is expected to be higher compared to 2015, given the adjustments in administered prices and the weaker ringgit exchange rate. The impact of these cost factors is, however, expected to be mitigated by the continued low energy and commodity prices and the generally subdued global inflation. Consequently, the inflation momentum is expected to be slower than earlier anticipated. Overall domestic financial conditions have remained relatively stable since the previous MPC meeting. Bank Negara Malaysia's monetary operations continue to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity to support the orderly functioning of the money and foreign exchange markets. The financial system continues to be sound with financial institutions operating with sufficient liquidity buffers. The growth of financing to the private sector has also remained healthy. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy is accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC recognises that there are heightened risks in the global economic and financial environment and is closely monitoring and assessing their implications on domestic price stability and growth. This is to ensure that the monetary policy stance is consistent with sustainable growth of the Malaysian economy. Bank Negara Malaysia 09 March 2016."
Euroarea,2016-03-10,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have conducted a thorough review of the monetary policy stance, in which we also took into account the new macroeconomic projections by our staff extending into the year 2018. As a result, the Governing Council has decided on a set of measures in the pursuit of its price stability objective. This comprehensive package will exploit the synergies between the different instruments and has been calibrated to further ease financing conditions, stimulate new credit provision and thereby reinforce the momentum of the euro area's economic recovery and accelerate the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2%. First, as regards the key ECB interest rates, we decided to lower the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by 5 basis points to 0.00% and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 5 basis points to 0.25%. The rate on the deposit facility was lowered by 10 basis points to -0.40%. Second, we decided to expand the monthly purchases under our asset purchase programme from €60 billion at present to €80 billion. They are intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. To ensure the continued smooth implementation of our asset purchases, we also decided to increase the issuer and issue share limits for the purchases of securities issued by eligible international organisations and multilateral development banks from 33% to 50%. Third, we decided to include investment-grade euro-denominated bonds issued by non-bank corporations established in the euro area in the list of assets that are eligible for regular purchases under a new corporate sector purchase programme. This will further strengthen the pass-through of our asset purchases to the financing conditions of the real economy. Purchases under the new programme will start towards the end of the second quarter of this year. Fourth, we decided to launch a new series of four targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO , starting in June 2016, each with a maturity of four years. These new operations will reinforce the ECB's accommodative monetary policy stance and will strengthen the transmission of monetary policy by further incentivising bank lending to the real economy. Counterparties will be entitled to borrow up to 30% of the stock of eligible loans as at 31 January 2016. The interest rate under TLTRO II will be fixed over the life of each operation, at the rate on the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations prevailing at the time of take-up. For banks whose net lending exceeds a benchmark, the rate applied to the TLTRO II will be lower, and can be as low as the interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing at the time of take-up. There will be no requirement for mandatory early repayments under TLTRO II, and switches from TLTRO I will be allowed. Finally, looking ahead, taking into account the current outlook for price stability, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Separate press releases with further details of the measures taken by the Governing Council will be published this afternoon at 15:30 CET. Adding to the measures taken since June 2014, with today's comprehensive package of monetary policy decisions we are providing substantial monetary stimulus to counteract heightened risks to the ECB's price stability objective. While very low or even negative inflation rates are unavoidable over the next few months, as a result of movements in oil prices, it is crucial to avoid second-round effects by securing the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. The Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely the evolution of the outlook for price stability over the period ahead. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP growth was confirmed at 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2015, supported by domestic demand, while being dampened by a negative contribution from net exports. The most recent survey data point to weaker than expected growth momentum at the beginning of this year. Looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to proceed at a moderate pace. Domestic demand should be further supported by our monetary policy measures and their favourable impact on financial conditions, as well as by continued employment gains benefiting from past structural reforms. Moreover, the low price of oil should provide additional support for households' real disposable income and private consumption, as well as corporate profitability and investment. In addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is slightly expansionary, partly reflecting measures in support of refugees. However, the economic recovery in the euro area continues to be dampened by subdued growth prospects in emerging markets, volatile financial markets, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and the sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. This outlook is broadly reflected in the March 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.4% in 2016, 1.7% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2018. Compared with the December 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised slightly down, mainly reflecting the weakened growth prospects for the global economy. The risks to the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside. They relate in particular to the heightened uncertainties regarding developments in the global economy, as well as to broader geopolitical risks. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was -0.2% in February 2016, compared with 0.3% in January. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for energy, inflation rates are expected to remain at negative levels in the coming months and to pick up later in 2016. Thereafter, supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should recover further. The Governing Council will closely monitor price-setting behaviour and wage developments in the euro area, paying particular attention to ensure that the current low inflation environment does not become entrenched in second-round effects on wage and price-setting. This broad pattern is also reflected in the March 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 0.1% in 2016, 1.3% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018. In comparison with the December 2015 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised down, mainly reflecting the fall in oil prices over recent months. Turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm solid growth in broad money (M3), with the annual rate of growth of M3 standing at 5.0% in January 2016, after 4.7% in December 2015. Annual growth in M3 continues to be mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 10.5% in January, after 10.8% in December. Loan dynamics continued the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.6% in January 2016, up from 0.1% in December 2015. Developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained stable at 1.4% in January 2016. Overall, the monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 have clearly improved borrowing conditions for firms and households, as well as credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for further monetary stimulus in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. However, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively. Given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies. In particular, actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase investment and boost job creation. The swift and effective implementation of structural reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also make the euro area more resilient to global shocks. As indicated by the European Commission, the implementation of country-specific recommendations continued to be fairly limited in 2015; reform efforts thus need to be stepped up in the majority of euro area countries. Fiscal policies should support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. Full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is crucial to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework. At the same time, all countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies."
South Korea,2016-03-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the US economy has emerged from its temporary slowdown and shown a trend of moderate growth. However, the trend of economic recovery in the euro area has weakened somewhat, while economic growth in emerging market countries including China has continued to slow. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that it will be affected by factors such as financial and economic conditions in China and other emerging market countries, international oil price movements, and global financial market volatility. Looking at the Korean economy, the trend of decline in exports and the weakening recovery of domestic demand activities such as consumption are continuing, while the sentiments of economic agents have been sluggish. On the employment front, as the number of persons employed has steadily increased, the employment-to-population ratio rose in January compared to that in January last year, while the unemployment rate fell. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will continue its recovery going forward, centering around domestic demand activities, but in view of external economic conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high. Consumer price inflation rose to a significant extent in February, from 0.8% the month before to 1.3%, owing chiefly to increases in agricultural product prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices meanwhile rose slightly to 1.8%, from 1.7% in January. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will continue at a low level, due mainly to the low oil prices. In the housing market, sales and leasehold deposit prices showed low rates of increase in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country. In the domestic financial markets, influenced by the global stock market recovery and by a subsiding of foreigners' securities investment fund outflows, stock prices have risen sharply since February and the Korean won, after having depreciated, has appreciated to a considerable extent against the US dollar. The won has meanwhile depreciated against the Japanese yen, in line with the yen's strengthening. Long-term market interest rates have rebounded slightly after having declined, in response mainly to interest rate movements in major countries. Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while working to sustain the recovery of economic growth, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon, and pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as any changes in the monetary policies of major countries or in financial and economic conditions in China, the movements of capital flows, geopolitical risks, and the trend of increase in household debt."
Poland,2016-03-11,"Warsaw, 11 March 2016 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 10-11 March 2016 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 1.50%;  lombard rate at 2.50%;  deposit rate at 0.50%;  rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic growth remains moderate and the uncertainty about its outlook has recently increased. Economic recovery is under way in the euro area, yet driven mainly by consumer demand amid weak investment and export growth. In the United States. GDP growth slowed down in the second half of 2015, following several years of recovery, and there is a risk of further economic weakening. In turn, economic growth continues to decelerate in China, while Russia and Brazil remain in recession. Concerns that activity in the emerging market economies might weaken further and the threat that this might translate into lower activity in the advanced economies currently pose the greatest risk for global economic conditions. Uncertainty about the global economy has affected financial market sentiment abroad, leading to a decline in the prices of many financial assets in recent months. Prices of oil and other commodities, including agricultural commodities, also remain low. In consequence, consumer price growth in many economies, including in the euro area, is close to zero, and inflation forecasts for the coming years are being revised down. The European Central Bank lowered interest rates in March and increased the scale of quantitative easing. In the United States, despite an increase in interest rate in December and indications of a further increase in the coming quarters, uncertainty about the future direction of monetary policy has risen. In Poland, stable economic growth continues and data for 2015 Q4 has even confirmed a slight acceleration in GDP growth. Domestic demand continues to be the key driver of GDP growth, supported by stable consumption growth and rising investment. The rise in demand is supported by favourable labour market conditions, positive consumer sentiment, sound financial standing of enterprises and their high capacity utilization, as well as lending growth. As the output gap remains negative and nominal wage growth is only moderate, there is no inflationary pressure in the economy. Annual consumer price growth and producer price growth remain negative. Yet, the persistence of deflation results mainly from the strong fall in global energy commodity prices in recent quarters. Inflation 1/2 expectations are still very low. The persisting deflation has not yet adversely affected decisions of economic agents. The Council became acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute, which is one of the inputs to the Council's decisions on NBP interest rates. In line with the March projection based on the NECMOD model  prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 23 February 2016 (projection cut-off date)  there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of -0.9  0.2% in 2016 (against 0.4  1.8% in the November 2015 projection), 0.2  2.3% in 2017 (compared to 0.4  2.5%) and 0.4  2.8% in 2018. At the same time, the annual GDP growth  in line with this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 3.0  4.5% in 2016 (against 2.3  4.3% in the November 2015 projection), 2.6  4.8% in 2017 (compared to 2.4  4.6%) and 2.1  4.4% in 2018. In the Council's assessment, price growth will remain negative in the coming quarters due to the earlier strong fall in global commodity prices. At the same time, a gradual increase in core inflation is expected. It will be supported by stable economic growth, including an anticipated rise in consumer demand growth driven by rising employment, forecasted acceleration of wage growth and an increase in social benefits. This notwithstanding, the downside risks to the global economic conditions are a source of uncertainty for the domestic economy. The Council continues to assess that  given the available data and forecasts  the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance. The Council adopted Inflation Report  March 2016."
Kazakhstan,2016-03-14,"PRESS - RELEASE #6 On the base rate March 14, 2016 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to keep the base rate unchanged at 17% with a symmetric interest rate corridor of +/- 2 percentage points. Interest rates on standing facilities are also kept unchanged at 19% to provide liquidity and at 15% to withdraw liquidity. The decision on the base rate was made taking into account risks for price stability, financial stability and economic growth outlook. Keeping the base rate at the same level in terms of economic slowdown indicates the necessity to ensure the demand for tenge assets. Situation in the domestic financial market indicates stabilization in the currency preferences of banking depositors  dollarization of bank deposits has stopped. The National Bank's measures to increase the attractiveness of tenge instruments will continue to influence on the gradual change in population preferences in favor of national currency deposits. In February 2016 headline inflation reached 15.2% year-on-year. Factors that determine inflation remained the same. The National Bank of Kazakhstan expects that headline inflation will slow down in the second half of the year and it will approach to the upper boundary of the objective range of 6-8 percent by the end of 2016. The next decision of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on May 5, 2016."
Peru,2016-03-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2016 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.25 percent. The Board has taken this decision considering that: The global economy continues showing mixed signals of recovery in terms of production and employment as well as lower volatility in financial markets, with currency appreciation trends in the emerging economies and a rise in commodity prices being observed. Inflation has been affected by temporary supply factors, such as the rise in the prices of some food products and utilities, as well as by the depreciation of the sol against the dollar, which has reversed in part. The increases in consumer prices have affected the expected rate of inflation, pushing it above the target range. Local economic activity has been recovering. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, including how inflation expectations evolve, to evaluate the convenience of making additional adjustments in the monetary policy rate. Inflation is expected to gradually return to be within the target range in a period of time similar to the monetary policy horizon. Inflation in February showed a rate of 0.17 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation fell from 4.6 percent January to 4.5 percent in February. The monthly rate of inflation is explained by the increase observed in the prices of education services and meals outside the home. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.52 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 3.4 percent in January to 3.8 in February. In January, the rate of inflation expected for 2016 was 3.5 percent while the rate of inflation expected for 2017 is estimated to be between 3.0 and 3.5 percent. Recent indicators of economic activity and business expectations show GDP growth rates similar to those of the potential output levels. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for April at the Board meeting that will be held on April 14, 2016."
United States,2016-03-16,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months. Household spending has been increasing at a moderate rate, and the housing sector has improved further; however, business fixed investment and net exports have been soft. A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to additional strengthening of the labor market. Inflation picked up in recent months; however, it continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. However, global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Stanley Fischer; Loretta J Mester; Jerome H Powell; Eric Rosengren; and Daniel K Tarullo. Voting against the action was Esther L George, who preferred at this meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. Implementation Note issued March 16, 2016."
Chile,2016-03-17,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 17 March 2016 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3.5%. International financial markets have been calmer in recent weeks, despite the still present risk of new episodes of volatility. Thus, risk premiums have fallen, while stock indexes and commodity prices have risen. Meanwhile, forecasts for world growth and developed economies' inflation have been downsized again. In this context, developed world central banks have taken action or made announcements indicating more expansionary monetary policies. Following the Federal Reserve's meeting, the dollar depreciated further and interest rates declined. On the domestic front, annual CPI and CPIEFE inflation remains above 4%, in line with projections. Inflation expectations two years out remain at 3%. The evolution of these variables will continue to be monitored with special attention. Available output and demand data reveal a weaker performance in late 2015 than was foreseen in the December Monetary Policy Report. Confidence indicators are still in pessimistic territory. The annual growth rate of salaried employment decelerated further, but unemployment remains low. The pace of annual wage growth picked up in January. The future path of the monetary policy rate considers measured adjustments aimed to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target, at a pace that will depend on incoming information and its implications on inflation. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2016-03-17,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release March 17, 2016 In its meeting held on March 17, 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation by 150 bps to 1075 percent, 1175 percent, and 1125 percent respectivel. The discount rate was also raised by 150 bps to 1125 percen. On March 14, 2016, the CBE decided to adopt a more flexible exchange rate regime that better reflects the underlying forces of supply and demand and in order to correct the imbalances that affected the foreign exchange flows in the banking secto. The more flexible exchange rate has restored confidence, creating a favorable investment climate that is expected to raise economic growth rates and attract capital inflow. Prior to this, the imbalances led to a widening premium between the official and unofficial rates which already had a pass-through effect on domestic price. Both annual headline and core inflation rates reached single digits, registering 91 percent and 75 percent, respectively in February 2016, which supported the timing of the depreciation decisio. The CBE's monetary policy will be geared towards maintaining price stability by avoiding double digit inflation rates over the medium-term to maintain real income. Moreover stable inflation rates are conducive to achieving sustainable economic growt. The MPC judges that a rate hike is warranted to anchor inflation expectation. The MPC reiterates its price stability mandate and will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, particularly fiscal policy and its effect on the inflation outlook, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

South Africa,2016-03-17,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 17 March 2016 Statement of the Monetary Policy Committee Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, headline inflation has exceeded the upper end of the target range as pressures from higher food prices in particular have intensified. Although the longer-term inflation outlook has improved somewhat, inflation is still expected to remain outside the target range for an extended period, and upside risks remain. The domestic economic growth prospects remain fragile following a fairly broad-based weakening in the final quarter of last year, while global economic prospects remain uncertain. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas increased markedly in January to 6,2 per cent, up from 5,2 per cent in December. Food price pressures intensified, with food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation accelerating to 6,9 per cent, up from 5,9 per cent previously. Goods price inflation increased from 4,6 per cent to 6,5 per cent, mainly due to higher food prices and base effects of petrol prices, while services price inflation increased from 5,7 per cent to 6,0 per cent. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, which had been relatively stable for some 1. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, which had been relatively stable for some 1 time, increased from 5,2 per cent in December to 5,6 per cent in January. Part of this may reflect some evidence of higher exchange rate pass-through. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods was also indicative of increased cost pressures, having increased from 4,8 per cent in December 2015 to 7,6 per cent in January. The main contributor to this acceleration was the category of food, beverages and tobacco products which contributed 2,8 percentage points to the January outcome. The latest inflation forecast of the Bank has improved somewhat but nevertheless the protracted, albeit lower, breach remains a serious concern. Inflation is now expected to average 6,6 per cent and 6,4 per cent in 2016 and 2017, compared with 6,8 per cent and 7,0 per cent previously. The forecast period has been extended to the end of 2018, and the forecast average for that year is 5,5 per cent. Inflation is expected to peak at 7,3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016, down from 7,8 per cent previously, and to return to within the target range, to 5,5 per cent, during the fourth quarter of 2017. Inflation is then expected to remain within the target range for the rest of the forecast period. These changes are due in part to the higher interest rate assumption following the increase in the repo rate at the previous meeting, a slightly less depreciated exchange rate assumption, and downward revisions to the international oil price and electricity tariff assumptions. The latter follows the Nersa decision to grant a lower-than-expected tariff adjustment of 9,4 per cent to Eskom. These pressures are counteracted to some extent by a higher food price forecast. The forecast for core inflation reflects a marginal near-term deterioration, reflecting expected exchange rate and wage cost pressures, but is slightly improved for 2017. Core inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range in the second 2. Core inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range in the second 2 quarter of 2016 for four consecutive quarters, with a peak at 6,5 per cent in the third and fourth quarters of 2016. This measure is expected to average 6,2 per cent in 2016, and 5,7 per cent and 5,2 per cent in the subsequent two years. The survey of inflation expectations conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research in the first quarter of 2016 presents a mixed picture. Although average expectations remain unchanged at 6,2 per cent for 2016 and 2017, those of analysts increased significantly, while expectations of business people and trade unions moderated for both years. Inflation is expected to average 6,0 per cent in 2018, with both analysts and trade unionists expecting inflation to be within the target range. The 5-year average inflation expectations remained unchanged at 6,1 per cent, and have been stable within a range of between 5,8 per cent and 6,2 per cent since the first quarter of 2012. The near-term expectations of economic analysts as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey also increased following the depreciation of the rand in December. In the survey conducted in March, the median expectation for 2016 and 2017 was 6,4 per cent and 6,3 per cent, but inflation is expected to return to within the target range in 2018, at a 5,6 per cent average. Bond market expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates are more or less unchanged since the previous meeting and remain at fairly elevated levels. The international economic outlook remains challenging following a marked decline in global growth in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as a continued moderation in industrial production in the advanced economies. This included a slowdown in the US, amid contractions in business fixed investment and exports, and a weakening in consumer spending. Some improvement is expected in the first quarter, although 3. Some improvement is expected in the first quarter, although 3 growth is expected to remain below potential in the coming months. Subdued growth is expected in the Japanese economy following a contraction in the fourth quarter, with only a slightly more favourable outlook for the euro area and the UK. The outlook for many emerging market economies remains weak, with continuing recessions in Brazil and Russia. The slowdown in China appears to be broad-based, with a declining PMI, moderating consumer demand, and lower imports and exports. The uncertain prospects for China remain a source of intense speculation and uncertainty for the rest of the global economy. There are few signs of global inflation pressures, with inflation below target in most advanced economies, particularly in Japan and the euro area. These trends, combined with slowing growth, have prompted looser monetary policies in a number of advanced economies, and accommodative policies are likely to persist. Contrary to this trend, the US Fed is expected to continue on its normalisation path, but at a gradual pace. By contrast, exchange-rate-induced inflation pressures persist in a number of emerging economies, particularly in Latin America, where more sustained tightening can be expected. The rand exchange rate has recovered somewhat from the lows experienced in December and January, but nevertheless remains highly volatile, and vulnerable to domestic and external developments. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand traded in a wide range of between around R16,40 and R15,07 against the US dollar, and has appreciated by 4,5 per cent against the US dollar, by 0,9 per cent against the euro, and by 2,0 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. A number of factors contributed to the appreciation of the rand during this period. These included the reaction to further monetary policy easing in the advanced 4. These included the reaction to further monetary policy easing in the advanced 4 economies, and the moderation of the US normalisation path; policy stimulus measures in China which overshadowed disappointing Chinese economic data; and the reaction to domestic monetary tightening. Offsetting factors include the weak domestic growth outcome and higher inflation outlook; the increased risk of a sovereign ratings downgrade; and domestic political developments which have had a significant impact on the rand in the past few days in particular. The exchange rate was also negatively impacted by the wider-than-expected current account deficit, and its slow pace of adjustment to a depreciated exchange rate. The adjustment is expected to remain slow, particularly in the context of declining global trade. While the current account was adequately financed in the fourth quarter, the lack of portfolio capital flows remains a concern, despite expectations of some improvement of flows to emerging markets in 2016. According to JSE data, since the beginning of the year, non-residents have been net purchasers of bonds to the value of around R6 billion, but net sellers of South African equities to the value of around R20 billion. The domestic economic growth outlook has deteriorated further. Annual economic growth of 1,3 per cent in 2015 was in line with the Bank's expectations, but the forecasts for 2016 and 2017 have been revised down from 0,9 per cent and 1,6 per cent, to 0,8 per cent and 1,4 per cent. Growth of 1,8 per cent is forecast for 2018. The potential output growth estimate remains unchanged at 1,5 per cent, rising to 1,8 per cent by 2018. The weak growth trend remains consistent with the Bank's leading business cycle indicator which declined further in December. Although the RMB/BER business confidence index was unchanged in the first quarter, it remained at its 5-year low, and masked a collapse in the manufacturing confidence index. 5 The GDP slowdown was fairly broad-based, with contractions in the agriculture, manufacturing and transport and communications sectors. The outlook for the first quarter for mining and manufacturing is constrained, following sharply negative growth rates in both sectors in January, particularly in mining. Although the Barclays PMI increased marginally in February, it remained below the neutral 50-level for the seventh consecutive month, and capacity utilisation in the sector also remains relatively low. The continuing drought also points to an unfavourable outlook for the agricultural sector. While growth in expenditure on gross fixed capital formation improved in the final quarter of 2015, it remains low at an annual growth rate of 1,4 per cent. Although capital expenditure by the private sector turned positive in the fourth quarter, it was concentrated in the renewable energy sector, while in most other sectors, real capital investment contracted. These growth and investment trends create an unfavourable climate for making inroads into the unemployment rate which increased marginally to 24,5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015 from 24,3 per cent a year earlier. Growth in consumption expenditure by households increased in the final quarter of 2015, but at 1,6 per cent was still at relatively low levels. While retail sales growth on a year-on-year basis was fairly resilient, the consecutive month-to-month contractions in real retail trade sales growth in December and January could signal further pressures on consumption expenditure, consistent with the low levels of consumer confidence. Total new vehicle sales continue to decline, although more positively, there was strong vehicle export growth in February. A number of factors are expected to constrain consumption expenditure despite the persistence of wage and salary increases in excess of inflation. These factors 6 include rising inflation and higher interest rates; high levels of household debt; and negative wealth effects from low or negative asset price growth. Furthermore, credit extension to households by the banking sector remains subdued, in contrast to the more vibrant growth in credit extension to the corporate sector, particularly with respect to mortgage advances on commercial properties and renewable energy investments. The recent budget tabled in parliament provides for a fiscal consolidation path which sees the consolidated government budget deficit declining from an estimated 3,2 per cent of GDP in 2016/17 to 2,4 per cent in 2018/19. This is expected to be achieved through a combination of a lower expenditure ceiling and increased tax revenues. This path, if realised, can be expected to moderate inflation somewhat while improving South Africa's credit metrics and confidence in general. Food price pressures, driven by the drought and the depreciated exchange rate, have intensified by more than previously forecast and remain a significant upside risk to inflation. Manufactured food price inflation measured 7,8 per cent in the PPI, while agricultural prices increased by 25,9 per cent, with cereals and other crops increasing by 79,2 per cent. These increases are expected to impact with a lag on consumer prices. Annual CPI food price inflation is now expected to peak at 11,6 per cent in the final quarter of 2016, compared with 11,3 per cent previously. International oil prices have recovered somewhat from their lows of below US$30 per barrel seen in January, as the global oversupply appears to have subsided in the wake of production cut-backs in a number of countries. Although the Bank has reduced its oil price assumption for the forecast period, it still assumes an upward trajectory as in the previous forecast. However, there is some upside risk to this 7. However, there is some upside risk to this 7 forecast, should some agreement on an output freeze be reached by some of the larger producers. The domestic petrol price was reduced by about 69 cents per litre earlier this month, to its lowest level since March 2015. However, the current under- recovery, driven mainly by higher international product prices, suggests that this decline could be substantially reversed in April. This increase will be in addition to the 30 cent per litre increase in the fuel levy announced in the budget. Although the inflation forecast has improved moderately since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the committee remains concerned about the protracted nature of the breach of the target. Furthermore, the committee assesses the risks to the forecast to be on the upside. The main risk factors relate to the exchange rate and food prices. The exchange rate of the rand continues to be highly volatile and vulnerable to changes in both domestic and external developments. While the pass-through from the exchange to inflation is still relatively low, there are signs that this may be increasing. Food prices have been accelerating faster than previously expected, due to the weaker exchange rate and the intensification of the drought, resulting in an upward revision to the food price forecast. The Committee views the risks to this forecast to be on the upside, particularly for 2017 when fairly strong favourable base effects are expected. A more protracted drought, combined with a weaker exchange rate and restocking of herds, may keep food price inflation elevated for a longer period than currently forecast. The Committee also assesses the risks to the international oil price assumption to be on the upside. The MPC is cognisant of the fact that demand pressures on inflation remain subdued, and indications are that household consumption expenditure is likely to 8. The MPC is cognisant of the fact that demand pressures on inflation remain subdued, and indications are that household consumption expenditure is likely to 8 remain constrained. Nevertheless the recent increase in core inflation and its expected upward trend is indicative of broader inflation pressures and possible second-round effects from supply side shocks. While the evolution of inflation expectations is critical in this regard, at this stage there is no clear evidence of a deterioration in longer-term inflation expectations, but they remain at an elevated level. The Committee remains concerned about the weak growth outlook amid negative business and consumer confidence. The growth challenges facing the economy are compounded by the deteriorating outlook for global growth. The committee assesses the risk to the growth outlook to be on the downside. Given the upside risks to the inflation forecast and the protracted period of the expected breach, the MPC decided that further tightening was required to complement the previous moves. Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 7,00 per cent per annum, effective from 18 March 2016. Three members favoured a 25 basis point increase while three members preferred no change. Ultimately the committee decided on an increase. The Committee faced the continuing dilemma of a deteriorating inflation environment and a worsening growth outlook. The MPC remains sensitive to the possible negative effects of policy tightening on cyclical growth, but will remain focused on its mandate of maintaining price stability.

Colombia,2016-03-18,"Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 6.5%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In February, annual consumer inflation and the average of core inflation measures continued to rise and stood at 7.59% and 6.07%, respectively. Analysts' inflation expectations to one and two years registered 4.5% and 3.8%, respectively, while those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years are between 4.5% and 4.9%. The strong increase in food prices as well as nominal depreciation and its partial pass-through to consumer prices largely explain last year's increase in inflation. Although they are considered temporary shocks, the magnitude of the depreciation of the peso and the intensity of El Nino increase the risk of a slower convergence of inflation to the target, due to its direct impact on prices and inflation expectations as well as to the triggering of indexation mechanisms. In the United States, the FED maintained its benchmark interest rate, and a slower tightening of monetary policy in that country is now more likely. The price of oil increased above the expectations of the technical staff for the current year. In this environment, risk measures for the country fell, and the peso appreciated vis--vis the US dollar, thus reverting part of the deterioration of the external conditions of the economy registered in recent months. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Colombian economy grew 3.3%, a figure higher than expected by the technical staff. Domestic demand weakened less than expected, and exports and imports recorded lower falls than had been estimated. For all 2015, growth posted at 3.1%, with a slower domestic demand. In the same year, the current account deficit was US$ 18,925 m, a figure US$ 668 million lower than the one registered for 2014. In February, the Consumer Confidence Index recorded historically low levels again; uncertainty about the persistence of this low level and its impact on household spending remains high. The urban unemployment rate exhibited a significant rebound, especially in Bogot. In contrast, retail sales (excluding vehicles), cement production and shippings, and industrial production recorded increases that surpass those expected by the technical staff in several cases. With all this, the technical staff maintained its economic growth forecast for 2016 at 2.7% as the most likely figure, within a range between 1.5% and 3.2%. In summary, a significant gap between expenditure and national income persists. High increases in food prices and the partial pass-through of depreciation to domestic prices continue to exert inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations remain high, and the risk of a slowdown in domestic demand in excess of that which is consistent with the decline in national income continues to be moderated. In order to ensure convergence of inflation to the target in 2017, and to contribute to the reduction of the current account deficit, the Board of Directors decided to continue with the path of 25 bp increases of the benchmark interest rate. The Board reiterates its commitment to the inflation target and continues to carefully monitor the behavior and projections of economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as that of asset markets and the international situation. Bogot."
Russia,2016-03-18,"On 18 March 2016, the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to keep its key rate at 11.00% p.a. Despite certain stabilisation in financial and commodity markets and a slowdown in inflation, inflation risks remain high. These stem from the current developments in the oil market, persistently high inflation expectations and some uncertainties surrounding budget configuration. To enable the accomplishment of inflation targets, the Bank of Russia may conduct its moderately tight monetary policy for a more prolonged time than previously planned. The Bank of Russia predicts that, consistent with this decision, annual inflation will total less than 6% in March 2017, to reach the 4% target in late 2017. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors took as a premise the expectations for oil prices which are lower than its December forecast. The current oil market still features a continued oversupply, on the backdrop of a slowdown in the Chinese economy, more supplies originating from Iran and tighter competition for market share. This is why the certain recovery in crude prices seen in the recent weeks may prove to be unsustainable. In recognition of this, the Bank of Russia assumed in its baseline scenario the average forecast oil price of $30 per barrel in 2016, with its gradual rise to $40 per barrel to 2018. Despite growing oil prices and ruble strengthening in the latest period, the accumulated weakening of the ruble, impacted by the drop in oil prices, between late 2015 and early 2016, is still putting pro-inflationary pressure on the economy, contributing to continued high inflation expectations. Meanwhile, inflation slowdown is continuing. Under the Bank of Russia estimates, the annual consumer price growth rate is down from 9.8% in January 2016 to 7.9 % as of 14 March 2016. This is lower than the forecast for inflation for the year ahead, which, the Bank of Russia released in its March 2015 press release (circa 9%). Alongside with monetary policy, instrumental in the slowdown of consumer prices are the Government decisions as regards indexation of wages and pensions, as well as declining global food prices. In 2Q 2016, as the Bank of Russia forecast suggests, quarterly inflation will continue to decline. However, annual inflation may accelerate temporarily in the middle of the year as a result of the low base effect. Provided there are no new shocks emerging, subsequently annual inflation is set to resume its decline. Slower consumer price growth will be triggered by weak demand and gradually descending inflation expectations, driven by, inter alia, the moderately tight monetary policy. The Bank of Russia forcasts that, consistent with the decision, annual inflation will total less than 6% in March 2017, to reach the 4% target in late 2017. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia took into account the macroeconomic fundamentals which suggest a less severe downturn than previously estimated considering this level of oil prices. The floating exchange rate serves to partially set off the negative impact of the external shocks on the economy. The weakening of the ruble has resulted in Russian products gaining competitiveness, while it also helped economic growth in individual industries. These include agriculture, the food industry, chemicals and mining. Employment data and production capacity utilisation have recently been steady. The economic adjustment to the low level of commodity prices is expected to continue. The Bank of Russia forecasts assume the economic downturn to slow down to 1.3%-1.5% in 2016. Also, it is expected that quarterly GDP growth rates will enter positive territory between late 2016 and early 2017. Going forward, the advancing processes of import substitution and non-energy export expansion will help a gradual economic recovery. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors has recognised that, as a result of the Reserve Fund spending to cover budget deficit, banks show decreased demand for the Bank of Russia's refinancing. Hence, we see softening of monetary conditions, impacted by reduced structural deficit of liquidity even if the key rate is unchanged. The risks remain that inflation may exceed the target in late 2017. These relate to a further worsening in the oil market developments; persistent elevated inflation expectations; the global food price performance; changed rates of indexation of regulated prices, wages and pensions, as well as the uncertainty around a balanced federal budget over the medium term. To enable the accomplishment of inflation targets, the Bank of Russia may conduct its moderately tight monetary policy for a more prolonged time than previously planned. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 29 April 2016. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Nigeria,2016-03-21,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique' No. 106 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of Monday and Tuesday. March 21 and 22, 2016 st nd The Monetary Policy Committee met on 21 and 22 March 2016 amidst uncertain global economic prospects and continuing challenges in the domestic economy. In attendance were 8 out of the 12 members. The Committee appraised the international and domestic economic and financial environments in the first two months of 2016 as well as the outlook for the rest of the year. International Economic Developments The Committee noted with concern the further decline in global output at the end of 2015, which grew at 23 per 1 cent, year-on-year in Q4, its slowest in three years, representing a 03 percentage point decline compared with 26 per cent in Q3. This deceleration stemmed from the continuous slowdown of growth in the emerging market economies, worsened by deteriorating conditions in the Euro area and China as well as key emerging market economies. Other factors include sustained pressure in global financial markets arising from US monetary policy normalization, depressed global oil market and persistently weakened global aggregate demand. The slowdown in growth in the United States to 10 per cent in Q4 from 20 per cent in Q3 was attributed to slowdown in private consumption expenditure (PCE) and non-residential fixed investments. In Japan, output declined by 14 percentage points in Q4, 2015 in contrast 2 to the 13 per cent growth recorded in Q3. The Bank of Japan's monthly asset purchase program of ¥67 trillion ($5671 billion) remains substantially sub-optimal, as the economy continues to lurch between contraction and expansion, with the adoption of a negative interest rate policy in January 2016. In the Euro area. GDP grew by 15 per cent in Q4 of 2015, and projected to grow at 17 per cent in 2016. The th European Central Bank (ECB), at its meeting on 10 of March, 2016 eased monetary policy by further reducing its refinancing rate to 00 per cent and deposit rate to - 04 per cent. The Bank also expanded its monthly asset purchase program from €60 billion ($654 billion) to €80 billion ($872 billion) to further stimulate output growth and move inflation towards its long term objective of 20 per cent. On the other hand, the Bank of England (BoE) sustained its stock of assets purchase, financed through the issuance of reserves at ₤375 billion ($53625 billion), while retaining its policy rate at 05 per cent. The BoE further committed to investing ₤84 billion ($1201 billion) of cash flows associated with redemption of the January 2016 government securities held in the Asset Purchase Facility, with a commitment to bring inflation closer to the 20 per cent target, reducing unemployment and promoting growth. Uncertainties and geo-political tensions in the Middle East, including a negotiated ceasefire agreement in Syria and Iran's re-entry into mainstream international oil market may have further redefined conditions in the oil market. The market witnessed some uptick in prices 4 following the resolve of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non- OPEC members to pursue a higher anchor price, coupled with smaller-than-anticipated build-up in stocks at the Cushing Oklahoma delivery hub for United States crude futures. The Emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) were forecast to grow at 43 per cent in 2016, an improvement over the 40 per cent recorded in 2015. However external and domestic challenges have persisted, stemming from low commodity prices, troubled financial markets, tepid global demand, policy uncertainty as well as continuously feeble growth in global trade. In addition, weaknesses in major emerging market economies, diminished capital inflows, rising borrowing costs and geopolitical factors have been 5 identified as possible deterrents to growth in the EMDEs. In the environment of suppressed inflation, slow growth, weak global demand and volatile financial markets, the stance of monetary policy in the advanced economies is expected to remain accommodative in 2016, while in the EMDEs, it is expected to be underpinned by currency adjustments and other complementary policies. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output The Bank had adopted accommodative monetary policy since July 2015 in the hope of addressing growth concerns in the economy, effectively freeing up more funds for DMBs by lowering both CRR and MPR, with excess liquidity arising from the lower CRR warehoused at the CBN. DMBs were to access these funds by submitting verifiable investment proposals in the real 6 sector of the economy. The funds have not impacted the market yet because the CBN was still processing some of the proposals submitted by the DMBs. In the first episode of easing which resulted in injecting liquidity into the Banking system. DMBs did not grant credit as envisaged. Moreover the delay in passage of the 2016 Budget has further accentuated the difficult financial condition of economic agents as output continues to decline due to low investment arising from weak demand. The cautious approach to lending by the banking system underpinned by a strict regulatory regime conditioned by the Basel Committee in the post global financial crisis era has further alienated investors from access to credit as banks prefer to build liquidity profiles in anticipation of government borrowing. In the light of these developments, domestic output growth in 2015 remained subdued as reported by the 7 National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Consequently, real GDP grew by 211 per cent in the last quarter of 2015, more than half a percentage point lower than the 284 per cent recorded in the third quarter and 383 percentage points in the corresponding period of 2014. Overall growth in 2015 was estimated at 279 per cent, compared with 622 per cent in 2014. The major impetus for growth continued to come from the non-oil sector which grew by 314 per cent in Q4, 2015 compared with 305 per cent in the preceding quarter. The key drivers of growth in the non-oil sector were Services. Agriculture and Trade; contributing 123, 083 and 076 percentage points, respectively. The Committee noted that the sluggish growth in output was directly attributable to certain fiscal uncertainties, which inadvertently hampered movement of labor and 8 goods; fuel scarcity, increased energy tariffs, foreign exchange scarcity as well as slow growth in credit to private sector in preference to high credit growth to the public sector. The Committee noted that many of these factors were outside the control of monetary policy and given these limitations, in the absence of complementary fiscal and structural policies, the only option was to continue with the existing measures. The MPC believes that complementary fiscal and structural policies are essential for reinvigorating growth. Prices The Committee noted the increase in year-on-year headline inflation to 1138 per cent in February 2016, from 962 per cent in January and 955 per cent in December, 2015. The increase in headline inflation in February reflected increases in both food and core components of inflation. Core inflation rose sharply for 9 the first time to 1100 per cent from 880 per cent in January after a lull of three consecutive months at 870 per cent through December, 2015. Food inflation also inched up to 1135 per cent from 1064 per cent in January and 1059 per cent in December, 2015. The rising inflationary pressure was traced to the lingering scarcity of refined petroleum products, exchange rate pass through from imported goods, seasonal factors and increase in electricity tariff. The Committee noted that the factors responsible for rising inflation were more structural in nature than monetary, but reaffirmed its commitment to monitor the developments closely and to work with the relevant authorities to address the underlying drivers of the upward price movements. 10 Monetary. Credit and Financial Markets Developments Broad money supply (M2) grew by 229 per cent in February, 2016 in contrast to 169 and 025 per cent in January 2016 and February 2015, respectively. When annualized. M2 grew by 1374 per cent in February 2016 against the provisional growth benchmark of 1098 per cent for 2016. Net domestic credit (NDC) grew by 371 per cent in the same period, annualized, at 2226 per cent. At this rate, the growth rate of NDC was below the provisional benchmark of 1794 per cent for 2016. Credit to the private sector grew by 145 per cent in February 2016, which annualized to a growth of 870 per cent, below the benchmark growth of 1328 per cent. The Committee noted with concern, the dismal performance of growth in credit to the private sector, noting that even at that, credit went primarily to low employment 11 elasticity sectors of the economy. This had a significant negative impact on output growth. Money market interest rates reflected the liquidity situation in the banking system. Average inter-bank call and OBB rates, which stood at 05 and 277 per cent on 25 January 2016, closed at 400 and 500 per cent, th respectively, on March 9, 2016. Between January 25 and end-February 2015, interbank call and OBB rates averaged 143 and 268 per cent, respectively. This was traced to liquidity surfeit in the banking system. The deposit money banks were, however, reluctant to grant new credit because of rising non-performing loans (NPLs), mainly in the oil sector, amongst other reasons. The Committee also noted the slight improvement in the equities segment of the capital market during the review period. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) rose by 802 per cent from N823 trillion to N889 trillion during the same period. However relative to end- December 2015, the indices declined by 973 per cent and 974 per cent, respectively. External Sector Developments The average naira exchange rate remained stable at the inter-bank segment of the foreign exchange market during the review period. The exchange rate at the interbank market opened at N19700/US$ and closed at N19700/US$, with a daily average of N19699/US$ between January 25 and March 14, 2016. The Committee reiterated its commitment to maintaining a stable naira exchange rate. The MPC took note of the level of activity in the autonomous foreign exchange market as well as the rising demand in the interbank market but observed 13 that the data on demand for foreign exchange, was being overshadowed by speculative demand. However the Committee charged the Bank to speed up reforms of the foreign exchange market to improve certainty and eliminate noise and opportunities for arbitrage. The Committee's Considerations The Committee noted the weakening macroeconomic environment, reflected particularly in foreign exchange shortages, slowing GDP growth rate and rising inflation. Overall economic growth slowed significantly in 2015, particularly in Q4. Apparently, the conditions responsible for the slowdown – uncertainty around fiscal policy, adverse external environment, security challenges in some parts of the country affecting production and distribution of agricultural produce, low electricity supply, fuel shortages, and sluggish growth in credit to 14 the private sector – have continued in the first quarter of 2016. On the monetary side, contrary to the notion of liquidity overhang in the financial system, the wider economy appears starved of the needed liquidity to spur growth and employment. Recent performance of the monetary aggregates lends credence to this fact. With the exception of credit to government, growth in all the monetary aggregates remained largely below their indicative benchmarks, yet; headline inflation spiked to 1138 per cent in February 2016, substantially breaching the policy reference band of 6 - 9 per cent. Apart from liquidity, the increase in inflation was driven by structural factors such as fuel scarcity, increased electricity tariff, persistent insecurity, exchange rate pass through and seasonality of agricultural produce. The conflicting signals from slowing growth and rising inflation present a 15 difficult policy challenge. Though mindful of the limitations of monetary policy in influencing the drivers of the current price spiral, the Committee stressed the need to urgently address the key sources of the pressures. In this regard, the Committee reaffirmed its commitment to closely monitor the development while encouraging relevant authorities to address the structural bottlenecks. From the monetary data, the Committee noted that the excess liquidity in the banking system was contributing to the current pressure in the foreign exchange market with a strong pass-through to consumer prices. The Committee further noted that previous efforts to reflate the economy in order to spur growth did not elicit the required response from DMBs, hence; the surfeit of liquidity in the interbank market. Obviously the attendant low rates at that market have not transmitted 16 to the term structure of interest rates. Concerned about the need for low interest rates to support growth and employment, the Committee urged the CBN to explore innovative ways of ensuring the unhindered flow of credit at low cost to key growth sectors even as monetary policy has to, under the circumstance, address the liquidity surfeit in the banking system as well as the pressure on exchange rate and consumer prices. The Committee hopes that fiscal and other structural policies would soon be deployed to strengthen the overall response of macroeconomic policy to the shocks. The Committee was also concerned that with headline inflation at 1138 per cent, noting that the policy rate had become negative in real terms. This development has the potential of keeping both foreign and domestic investments on hold. As part of measures to address the supply constraint in the foreign exchange market, yields 17 on domestic instruments have to be competitive to attract the much needed foreign inflows. On the administrative side, this will have to be complemented by a comprehensive reform of the foreign exchange market which is currently being undertaken. For the avoidance of doubt, the Bank would continue to allow domiciliary account holders unfettered access to funds in their accounts. The Committee also urged speedy passage of the 2016 Budget in order to halt the depressing effect of the uncertainty that engulfs the waiting period, hoping that the implementation of the budget would go a long way in boosting business confidence, and reinvigorating the financial markets. In the circumstance, the Committee urged the Bank to continue to upscale its surveillance of the financial system with the aim of promptly detecting 18 and managing vulnerabilities to ensure sustained stability. Finally the Committee remains committed to price stability across the range of consumer prices, exchange rate and interest rate, which is fundamental to reviving economic growth and employment generation. In the meantime, the Bank would continue to leverage its development finance policy to support critical sectors of the economy. The MPC also stressed the need to sustain, deepen and speed up reforms designed to ensure focused coordination of monetary and fiscal policies. The Committee's Decisions The Committee, in its assessment of relevant internal and external indices, came to the conclusion that the balance of risks is tilted against price stability. The MPC therefore, voted to tighten the stance of monetary 19 policy. One member voted to retain the CRR at 2000 per cent while another member voted to retain the current width of the asymmetric corridor. In summary, the MPC voted to: Raise MPR by 100 basis points from 1100 per cent to 1200 per cent; Raise CRR by 250 basis points from 2000 to 2250 per cent; Retain Liquidity Ratio at 3000 per cent; and Narrow the asymmetric corridor from +200 and -700 basis points to +200 and -500 basis points Thank you for listening.

Philippines,2016-03-22,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy rates at 4.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs and special deposit accounts (SDA) were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's assessment of manageable inflation outlook and robust growth conditions continue to support keeping monetary policy settings unchanged. Latest forecasts indicate that average inflation is likely to settle within the target range of 3.0 percent ± 1 percentage point for 2016-2017, while inflation expectations continue to be firmly anchored within the inflation target band over the policy horizon. The Monetary Board also noted that the risks surrounding the inflation outlook have remained tilted to the downside, as downward price pressures could arise from slower-than-expected global economic activity and potential second-round effects from lower international oil prices. Meanwhile, upside risks to the inflation outlook persist, particularly those that could emanate from the impact of El Niño dry weather conditions on food prices and utility rates as well as pending petitions for power rate adjustments. At the same time, the Monetary Board observed that domestic demand conditions continue to be buoyant, supported by solid private household and capital spending, positive business sentiment, and adequate credit and domestic liquidity. The Monetary Board also recognized that uncertainty over economic growth prospects across the globe could continue to drive volatility in global financial markets in the months ahead. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board affirmed the need to keep a watchful eye over domestic and external developments to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains in line with the BSP's price and financial stability objectives."
Thailand,2016-03-23,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 23 March 2016 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 23 March 2016 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. Key considerations for policy deliberation are as follows. The Thai economy continued to gradually recover on the back of public expenditure, tourism, and expansion in investment of certain businesses. However the overall economic momentum slowed, following dissipation of the effect of the government's tax rebate measure around the end of last year and of the accelerated car purchase prior to the increase in vehicle excise tax this year. Meanwhile merchandise export value contracted markedly and looked to recover slowly due to a slowdown in major trading partners' economies, shifting global trade structure, and Thailand's declining export competitiveness. Therefore the economic growth forecast was revised down from the assessment at the previous meeting. In addition, risks to growth might arise from a fragile recovery of the global economy and monetary policy divergence among advanced economies, which could influence capital flows and exchange rate movements, and had already caused the baht to strengthen during some recent periods, which might not be as conducive to the economic recovery as it could be. Headline inflation continued to stay in the negative territory due to a fall in global oil prices around the end of 2015. As a result, inflationary pressure remained low. Core inflation slowed once excluding the one-off rise in tobacco and vehicle excise taxes, reflecting lower demand-side support. Inflationary risks hence skewed more towards the downside. Meanwhile risks to financial stability from search-for-yield behavior continued to warrant close monitoring. In deliberating monetary policy, the Committee judged that the Thai economy would probably expand at a lower rate than previously assessed. However monetary conditions remained accommodative, and the policy space should be preserved. Therefore the policy rate should be kept on hold at this meeting. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments closely, and stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to support the economic recovery, while ensuring financial stability."
Turkiye,2016-03-24,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 10.75 percent to 10.5 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 12.25 percent to 12 percent. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports at an increasing pace, despite elevated geopolitical risks in other export markets. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Recently, global volatility has eased to some extent. Moreover, with the use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August 2015 effectively, the need for a wide interest rate corridor has been reduced. In this respect, the Committee decided to take a measured step towards simplification. However, improvement in the underlying core inflation trend remains limited, necessitating the maintenance of a tight liquidity stance. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2016-03-28,"Staff Forecast. Governor Remarks. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index for February declined by 0.3 percent, a slightly more moderate rate than the average of forecasters' predictions for a decline of 0.4 percent. There were seasonal price declines of 3.9 percent in the clothing and footwear component and of 1.6 percent in the vegetables and fruit component, and there was a marked decline of 1.0 percent in the transport and communication component, against the background of the reduction in public transportation fares. The inflation rate over the past 12 months was negative 0.2 percent,compared with negative 0.6 percent in the 12 months ending in January. Theincrease in the annual inflation rate in the past two months derives to a large extent from the index readings for January and February 2015: which contained exceptional reductions in water, electricity and fuel prices: dropping out of the calculation. Excluding energy prices and administrative price reductions, inflation over the past 12 months was 0.9 percent. Prices of components representing tradable goods in the CPI declined by 2.5 percent over the past 12 months, and the prices of components representing nontradable items increased by 1.1 percent. Inflation andinterest rate forecasts: This month there was a relatively sharp increase in inflation expectations, against the background of the turnaround in oil prices. For the first time in three months, one-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market are positive, at 0.2 percent (compared with negative 0.2 percent in the previous month). Expectations derived from banks' internal interest rates are 0.1 percent (compared with negative 0.4 percent last month). Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings are for an increase of 0.6 percent (compared with 0.4 percent in the previous month). There were also increases in medium-term and long-term forward expectations: three-year expectations increased from 0.9 percent to 1.3 percent, medium-term (3-5 years) expectations increased from 1.4 percent to 1.5 percent, and long-term (5 C2 AD-10 years) expectations increased from 1.9 percent to 2.2 percent. The makam curve and the Telbor curve increased slightly in recent weeks, and do not indicate any change expected in the interest rate in the next year. According to the average of projections by private forecasters, the Bank of Israel interest rate is expected to remain at its current level over the next three months, though an increase is expected in the second half of 2016. Real economicactivity: Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month point to a growth rate similar to that of recent years. After the rate of growth accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2015, some moderation is apparent in the first quarter of 2016. The second estimate of National Accounts data for the fourth quarter (seasonally adjusted in annual terms) indicates that GDP and business sectorproduct each grew by 3.9 percent: a higher rate than in the previous quarters of the year. Goods exports (excluding ships and aircraft and diamonds, in current dollar terms) increased by 1.0 percent in December-February, though the latest data for February indicate a decline of 3.6 percent in exports, compared with an increase of 8.5 percent in imports (excluding ships and aircraft, diamonds, and fuels). The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.25 percent in February. Preliminary data from the Companies Survey show that the net balance declined, returning to therange indicating that the economy returned to its moderate growth rate of recent years. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics declined in February after increasing in January, while the index compiled by Bank Hapoalim was essentially unchanged. The Purchasing Managers Index declined again, to 46.8 points, and for the second month is ata level indicating contraction of activity. The effect of the security situation on activity remains moderate: the number of tourists increased by 9.7 percent (seasonally adjusted) in February compared with January. The labor market: Labor Force Survey data for February indicate that among the prime working ages (25-64), the unemployment rate increased from 4.5 percent in January to 4.6 percent, the employment rate declined from 76.2 percent to 75.8 percent, and the labor force participation rate declined from 79.8 percent to 79.4 percent). Despitethis, the labor market picture remains positive. The job vacancy rate increased again in February to 3.6 percent. Nominal wages for Israelis increased by 0.4 percent and real wages increased by 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter (seasonally adjusted data). In 2015, (fourth quarter over fourth quarter of 2014) nominal wages increased by 2.6 percent, continuing the increase of 1.7 percent in 2014, with wage increasesin most industries. The number of employee posts increased by 2.6 percent,compared with 3.0 percent in 2014. Health tax receipts for December-February were 6.7 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period in the year before: and reflect the increase in employment and wages. Budget data: The cumulative domestic surplus (excluding net credit) in government activity was NIS 1.7 billion in January-February 2016, compared with a surplus of NIS 2.5 billion in the corresponding period of 2015, and it is about NIS 0.5 billion below the seasonal path consistent with achieving the deficit target for 2016. Tax revenues in February were NIS 21.3 billion. NIS 0.1 billion lower than the seasonal path consistent with the estimate of tax revenue. Tax revenues in February were about 7-7.5 percent higher in real terms than in February of last year (based on an estimate that nets out the effects of extraordinary activities and legislative changes). However, gross domestic VAT collection, net of the effect of legislative changes and real estate taxes receivedin February, increased by only 1.7 percent in real terms (compared with anincrease of 4 percent in January and of 6.3 percent in December), and likely indicates a slowdown in the rate of expansion of private consumption. Staff forecast: This month, the Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast. The notice of the forecast is being published in parallel with this release. Compared with the previous quarterly forecast, the current forecast reflects more moderate assessments of the inflation and interest rates. The inflation rate is expected to be 0.8 percent over the coming four quarters and is expected to return to within the target range toward the middle of 2017. The Bank of Israel interest rateis expected, according to the staff forecast, to remain at 0.1 percent during the coming year, and to increase to up to 0.5 percent toward the end of 2017, while remaining lower than the US federal funds rate for some time. GDP is expected to grow in 2016 by 2.8 percent (similar to the previous forecast) and in 2017 by 3.0 percent (3.1 percent in the previous forecast). The foreign exchange market: From the monetarypolicy discussion on February 21, 2016, through March 23, 2016, the shekelstrengthened by 1.8 percent against the dollar and by 0.5 percent in termsof the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the preceding 12 months, the shekel appreciated by 6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on February 21, 2016, through March 23, 2016, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 4.5 percent, in linewith the global trend. Nominal yields increased along the entire curve by a rate of up to 11 basis points, while on the CPI-indexed curve, yields declined by a rate of up to 30 basis points, primarily in the short-medium term. The makam curve traded at a yield ranging around the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, declined to about 79 basis points. The money supply: In the 12 months ending in February, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 38.3 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 12.2 percent. The credit market: Business sector debt increased by about NIS 2.4 billion (0.3 percent) in the fourth quarter, to about NIS 809 billion. This increase derived from a quantitative increase of about NIS 4.8 billion, mainly in bank credit, and the increase was partly offset by the decline in the CPI and the appreciation of the shekel against the dollar. In February, the nonfinancial business sector issued bonds totalingNIS 4.1 billion, after issuing only NIS 0.8 billion in January. Mutual fund withdrawals moderated in February and in the beginning of March due to the improvement in the markets, and some funds even switched to net new investments, after net withdrawals totaling NIS 11.1 billion since the beginningof the year. Corporate bond spreads were about 4 percentage points in the middle of March, a decline of about 0.4 percentage points from the end of February. Total household debt increased in the fourth quarter by about NIS 7.5 billion (1.6 percent, and of which NIS 4.2 billion was housing debt), to a total of about NIS 475 billion (of which NIS 322 billion is housing debt). In February, the total volume of new mortgages taken out was NIS 4.9 billion, and the flow of mortgages extended over the previous 12 months remains high, at about NIS 65 billion. Continuing the trend that has been apparent since May, the interest rate on new mortgages issued in February increased by 4-24 basis points in all indexation tracks, except for the fixed-rate unindexed track, in which the interest rate declined by about 2 basis points. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.1 percent in February, after declining by 0.5 percent in January. In December-January home prices increased by 0.6 percent, and over the 12 months ending in January they increased by 7.8 percent. The number of transactions remains elevated, and in November-January it reached an average of about 8,600, with an increase in the number of transactions by investors: which increased even though purchase tax on investment transactions increased in July. After the stock of new homes available for sale stabilized in recent monthsat approximately 28,000 homes, the figure increased slightly in January, to about 29,600 homes, a historically high level. In 2015, there were 47,800 building starts, an increase of 3.9 percent compared with 2014, and even though the rate of building starts moderated in the second half, the volume of starts in the past two years indicates that building completions are expected to remain at a high level in the coming quarters as well. With that, most of the increase is not in areas of high demand. The global economy: This month, there was a continuation of the trend of moderation in global economic activity: particularly in developing economies and in Japan: with continued weakness in the manufacturing sector and further moderation in the rate of growth of the services sector. In Europe and in the US, data show continued moderate but stable growth, with a continued slow improvement in the labor market. Stock market indices increased, with a decline in risk indices. The Fed kept the federal funds rate unchanged, and projections of FOMC members regarding the pace of interest rate increases moderated. Fourth quarter of 2015 growth data were revised upward, to an annual rate of 1.4 percent (compared with 0.7 percent in the first estimate), and personal consumption expenditure increased in January by an annual rate of 4.2 percent. The nonfarm payroll report continued to indicate high numbers of new jobs: In February,242,000 new jobs were added, and figures for December and January were revised upward by 30,000 jobs. The unemployment rate remained at 4.9 percent. In contrast, the weakness in the manufacturing sector continued, and the leading indicators in the services sector have been declining for a number ofmonths. In Europe, the rate of inflation was negative in February. Inflation in the past 12 months reached -0.2 percent. Against this background, andas the growth forecast was revised downward, the ECB announced further significant policy measures, mainly including a further decrease of the interest rate (the declared rate to 0 percent, and the interest on deposits to -0.4 percent), expanded monthly asset purchases from E 282 AC 60 billion to 80 billion, expanding the types of assets purchased to also include nonfinancial corporate bonds, andexpanding the program of loans to the banking system at zero or negative interest. The Bank of Japan left the volume of purchases and the negative interest rate on deposits unchanged, but prepared the ground for further easing as necessary. Other central banks (of Norway. Hungary. New Zealand and Taiwan) reduced their interest rates this month, due to the slowdown in the economy and a further decline in the inflation environment. Data from emerging markets indicate a continuation of the slowdown, particularly among commodity exporters such as Russia and Brazil. The data published in China continue to reflect moderation in the growth rate, mainly in the manufacturingsector. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil increased sharply this month, to around $40, after ranging between $28 and $35 in the previous month. The index of commodities excluding energy continued to increase this month, by about 2 percent. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for April 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. In view of developments in the inflation environment, in growth in Israel and in the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policiesof major central banks, the Monetary Committee continues to assess that monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: C 2B 7 The inflation environment remained low this month as well, against the background of price reductions initiated by the government and low energy prices. However, the increase in oil prices and the beginning of the exhaustion of the effect of administrative price reductions led to a relatively sharp increasein inflation expectations from all sources and for all ranges. Based on the Research Department's staff forecast, assuming that there are no sharp changes in oil prices and no additional price reductions, the annual inflation rate is expected to enter the target range toward the middle of 2017. The increase of wages in the economy is expected to support this process. C 2B 7 The picture of real economic activity, in which the economy is continuing to grow by the same moderate rate that characterized it in recent years, did not change this month: the acceleration of growth in the fourth quarter apparentlydid not continue in the first quarter. This is indicated by preliminary data from the Companies Survey and from the latest data on goods exports, which showed them to be low. In contrast, the picture conveyed by labor marketdata remains positive: a sharp increase in health tax receipts together with other data indicates a high level of employment and a prolonged increase in wages, and the job vacancy rate increased again. C 2B 7 The trend of moderation in global economic activity continued this month, in particular in developing economies and in Japan. The ECB and several other central banks enhanced their monetary accommodation this month, and FOMC members moderated their projected path of federal funds rate increases. C 2B 7 The nominal effective exchange rate remained relatively stable this month. From themonetary policy discussion on February 21, 2016, through March 23, 2016, the shekel strengthened by about 1.8 percent against the US dollar and by 0.5 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the past 12 months there has been an appreciation of 6 percent in terms of the nominaleffective exchange rate, and its level continues to weigh on growth of exports and the tradable sector. C 2B 7 The increase in home prices continues, and they rose by 7.8 percent over the past 12 months. The volume of new mortgages taken out remains high, despite the increase in mortgage interest rates in recent months. The elevated level of activity in the construction industry is expected to continue contributing to an increase in supply. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that despite the signs of an increase in the inflation environment, the risks to achieving the inflation target and to growthremain high. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will usethe tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and inthis regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for April 2016 will be published on April 11, 2016. The decision regarding the interest rate for May 2016 will be published at 16:00 on Thursday. April 21, 2016. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for April 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability.

Armenia,2016-03-29,"PRESS RELEASE 29.03.2016 At the March 29, 2016 meeting the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 0.25 percentage point to 8.25%. In February of 2016 deflation was 1.4% compared to 0.1% recorded in the same month of the previous year. In the meanwhile, the 12-month inflation rate continued falling; at the end of the month it amounted to -1.7%. Monthly deflation was entirely due to the decrease in prices of imported food products. In the external sector, trends of slow global economic growth were maintained while international commodity markets remained deflationary. The Board of the CBA estimates that the deflationary impact on domestic prices, transmitted from the external sector, will persist in the upcoming months. The Board notes that in January-February, relative to the same reference period last year, the economic activity indicator has slightly exceeded expectations, amounting to 4.7%, with main contribution of strong growths in industry and services. The domestic demand is still sluggish, although the Central Bank and the Government carried out expansionary policies during the first quarter of the year. At the same time, a significant increase in external demand for domestic goods and services observed at the beginning of the year resulted in the increase of exports and completely offset the impact of weak domestic demand on aggregate demand. Therefore, the low inflation is totally a result of deflationary effects spilled over from international markets of commodities and food products, which further contributes to maintaining the purchasing power of incomes, reduction of costs of firms and gradual decline in inflation expectations. In this circumstance, the Board believes that abrupt easing of monetary conditions at the end of the last year is by and large sufficient to offset the deflationary pressures during the year. However, the Board now considers it appropriate to continue gradual easing of monetary conditions, which will drive the inflation environment to expand gradually starting from the second half of the year, and the 12-month inflation rate will approach the target in the forecast horizon. The Board of the CBA will look to further easing of the monetary conditions, as expected economic developments unfold and no additional risks emerge in external and domestic sectors. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes of Interest Rate) due on April 8, 2016. Press Service of the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia."
Czech Republic,2016-03-31,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the Czech National Bank still stands ready to intervene automatically, i.e. without the need for an additional decision of the Bank Board, and without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is based on the message of the current forecast and on an assessment of newly available information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the koruna exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016. Inflation is still well below the CNB's target of 2%. According to the current forecast, inflation will increase, hitting the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon (i.e. in the first half of next year) and then moving slightly above it. According to the current forecast, sustainable fulfilment of the target, which is a condition for a return to conventional monetary policy, will occur in the first half of 2017. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the current forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being slightly anti-inflationary. A need to maintain expansionary monetary conditions at least to the current extent persists. The Bank Board therefore states again that the Czech National Bank will not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017. In view of the slightly anti-inflationary balance of risks to the current forecast, the Bank Board considers it likely that the commitment will be discontinued nearer to mid-2017. The subsequent return to conventional monetary policy will not result in the exchange rate appreciating sharply to the slightly overvalued level recorded before the CNB started intervening, among other things because the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to the price level and other nominal variables. At the same time, the Bank Board repeated that any exchange rate appreciation following the discontinuation of the exchange rate commitment would be dampened, among other things, by hedging of exchange rate risk by exporters during the existence of the commitment, by the closing of koruna positions by financial investors and by possible CNB interventions to mitigate exchange rate volatility. The Bank Board again discussed the possibility of using negative interest rates. Annual headline inflation increased at the start of this year, reaching 0.5% in February. However, the current forecast had expected higher inflation. The deviation from the forecast was due mostly to food prices, which continued to decline year on year, whereas the forecast had predicted renewed annual growth. Adjusted inflation excluding fuels was also slightly lower than forecasted. However, this indicator of core inflation remains above 1%, reflecting the effect of the growing domestic economy and accelerating wage growth. Fuel prices dropped markedly, in line with the forecast. Administered prices went up as a result of an unexpected rise in electricity prices for households and a smaller-than-forecasted decline in natural gas prices, whereas the forecast had expected them to stay broadly flat. The growth rate of the Czech economy slowed to 4% in 2015 Q4, whereas the forecast had expected growth to be more than one percentage point higher. The deviation of annual GDP growth from the forecast was due to significantly slower growth in gross capital formation, with growth in fixed investment and change in inventories both lagging behind the CNB's expectations. The more modest growth of fixed investment is probably linked with earlier completion of projects co-financed from EU funds. The growth rate of exports of goods and services was also lower than forecasted. However, growth in imports was much slower than forecasted. As a result, net exports increased slightly year on year, whereas the forecast had expected them to decrease modestly. Annual growth in government consumption was only slightly above the forecast and household consumption was broadly in line with the forecast. New information on economic developments abroad obtained from the March Consensus Forecasts suggests that demand in the effective euro area will continue to rise at a steady pace of around 2%. Growth in euro area economic activity is still being supported mainly by low oil prices and easy monetary conditions. By contrast, the forecast for euro area producer prices has been lowered as a result of the pass-through of falling energy commodity prices over the entire monitored horizon, in particular for this year. Therefore, it is now expected that the decline in foreign producer prices will not fade out before the end of this year. The outlook for consumer price inflation this year has decreased by 0.5 percentage point, owing chiefly to a continuing decline in energy prices for households. Euro area consumer price inflation is still expected to accelerate in 2017, but in this case as well the current forecast is slightly lower than the assumptions of the CNB forecast. The market outlook for the three-month Euribor has shifted deeper into negative territory owing to the March interest rate cut by the European Central Bank and the increased volume of its quantitative easing. By contrast, the market outlook for Brent crude oil has increased by around USD 5 a barrel over the entire forecast horizon, mainly in reaction to negotiations between large world oil producers regarding a cut in production. The Brent price is therefore expected to rise gradually until the end of 2017, from its current level around USD 40 a barrel to slightly below USD 50 a barrel. The outlook for the euro-dollar exchange rate has shifted slightly towards a stronger euro over the entire forecast horizon. This reflects the Federal Reserve's communication suggesting a more gradual tightening of its monetary policy. At the same time, the European Central Bank communicated after its March meeting that its interest rates have probably reached their trough. The buoyant domestic economic growth is fostering a further improvement in the labour market situation. Total employment and the number of employed persons continued to rise markedly in 2015 Q4, at a higher pace than forecasted. In line with expectations, the persisting growth in labour demand was also reflected in a further drop in unemployment. By contrast, annual wage growth in the business sector rose only slightly to almost 4%, whereas the forecast had expected a sharper acceleration. In line with the forecast, wages in the non-business sector also rose by almost 4%. Indicators from the real economy point to continued economic growth this year. Retail sales are still rising strongly. Growth in industrial production has slowed somewhat in recent months, but this is partly due to extraordinary factors. Conversely, the halt in construction output growth is consistent with the expected downturn in government investment activity connected with the only gradual start of the new programme period for EU funds. Prices in manufacturing are still falling year on year and the decline deepened in February. The renewed annual growth in agricultural producer prices in 2016 Q4 was only short-lived and these prices have been falling again year on year in 2016 so far. Prices in market services are broadly flat year on year, whereas construction work prices are continuing to rise moderately. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy, annual GDP growth was considerably slower than forecasted in 2015 Q4. Inflation in February and average wage growth in 2015 Q4 were also below the forecast. Unemployment has been approximately in line with the forecast in 2016 Q1."
Romania,2016-03-31,"Video (Romanian only): Press briefing, 31 March 2016. In line with expectations, the annual inflation rate went deeper into negative territory in the first two months of this year, reaching -2.68 percent in February against -0.93 percent in December 2015, largely under the impact of the cut in the standard VAT rate to 20 percent, from 24 percent, starting 1 January 2016. The average annual CPI inflation rate stood at -1.1 percent in February 2016, while the average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is relevant for assessing convergence with the European Union, came in at -0.8 percent. Annual GDP growth rate remained relatively high in 2015 Q4 as well, hitting a post-crisis high of 3.7 percent in the year as a whole. On the demand side, private consumption was further the main driver of economic growth in the final three-month period of 2015. Nevertheless, investment also rose at a faster pace, given that most of the planned public investment was undertaken towards the end of the year. At the same time, the negative contribution of net exports to growth widened. The latest statistical data show an ongoing swift rate of increase of consumer demand, under the impact of the new fiscal easing measures and higher household income. Less encouraging signals come from the slowing activity in the industrial and construction sectors, as well as from somewhat weaker confidence in the economy. Across industry, the growth rates of labour productivity and wages still posted diverging trends. Real annual dynamics of credit to the private sector remained on an upward trend, amid the faster increase in leu-denominated loans. Loans in domestic currency accounted for 51.7 percent of the loan stock in February 2016, the highest reading since July 2007, paving the way for an improvement in monetary policy transmission and for the mitigation of risks to financial stability. Recent assessments point to the annual inflation rate staying negative until June 2016, as a result of the cut in the standard VAT rate and other indirect taxes. At the same time, mention should be made of the persistence of risks associated with the domestic environment, due primarily to the expansionary impact of the fiscal and income policies in the context of the forthcoming elections. On the external front, worth noting is the escalating uncertainty about the euro area economic recovery, stemming from the ongoing slowdown of the Chinese economy and of other major emerging economies, as well as from the geopolitical tensions, which is likely to pose risks to Romania's economic growth. Adding to these are the developments in international oil prices and the increase in global financial market volatility, as well as the divergence between monetary policy stances of the world's major central banks. Against this background, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum, to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system, and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. Moreover, the NBR Board considers that a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and further implementation of structural reforms are pivotal for strengthening the Romanian economy. The NBR is monitoring both domestic and external developments for an adequate use and dosage of all its available tools to fulfil the overriding objective regarding medium-term price stability and preserve financial stability. In line with the preannounced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 5 May 2016, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
India,2016-04-05,"First Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2016-17 By Dr.Raghuram G. Rajan. Governor Part A: Monetary Policy Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 6.75 per cent to 6.5 per cent; reduce the minimum daily maintenance of the cash reserve ratio (CRR) from 95 per cent of the requirement to 90 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning April 16, 2016, while keeping the CRR unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL); continue to provide liquidity as required but progressively lower the average ex ante liquidity deficit in the system from one per cent of NDTL to a position closer to neutrality; and narrow the policy rate corridor from +/-100 basis points (bps) to +/- 50 bps by reducing the MSF rate by 75 basis points and increasing the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points, with a view to ensuring finer alignment of the weighted average call rate (WACR) with the repo rate; Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 6.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate to 7.0 per cent. The Bank Rate which is aligned to the MSF rate also stands adjusted to 7.0 per cent. Assessment 2. Since the sixth bi-monthly statement of February 2016, global economic activity has been quiescent. Perceptions of downside risks to recovery in some advanced economies (AEs) at the beginning of 2016 have eased, while major emerging market economies (EMEs) continue to contend with weak growth and still elevated inflation amidst tighter financial conditions. World trade remains subdued due to falling import demand from EMEs and stress in mining and extractive industries. In the US, consumer spending was underpinned by a strengthening labour market, but flagging exports proved to be a drag on growth in Q4 and cloud the near- term outlook. In the Euro area, tailwinds in the form of aggressive monetary policy accommodation and still low energy prices have supported activity in an environment beset with uncertainties from the migrant crisis, intensifying stress in the banking sector, and possible Brexit. While Japan escaped recession in Q4 of 2015, a2 combination of weak consumer spending, business investment and exports has slowed the economy in Q1 of 2016. In China, sluggish industrial production, contracting exports, capital outflows and substantial excess capacity in factories and the property market remain formidable headwinds, notwithstanding significant monetary and fiscal policy stimulus. EME commodity exporters have benefited recently from the firming up of commodity prices and risk-on investor sentiment has appreciated their currencies. Across EMEs, however, weak domestic fundamentals, lacklustre external demand and country-specific constraints continue to restrain growth. Global financial markets have recouped the losses suffered in the turbulence at the beginning of the year. From mid-February, a firming up of crude prices buoyed market sentiment, allaying fears of global recessionary risks. With China reducing reserve requirements, the ECB expanding accommodation and the Fed providing dovish guidance while staying on hold, equity markets rallied. In bond markets across AEs and EMEs, yields gradually eased, with country-specific variations. The US dollar has retreated from January peak and has eased further in the aftermath of the FOMC's March meeting. On the other hand, the euro and the yen have appreciated, reacting perversely to exceptional accommodation. Currencies across EMEs have also appreciated as portfolio flows returned cautiously to local debt and equity markets. Gold prices have jumped 16 per cent in Q1 of 2016 on safe haven demand. Commodity prices, including oil, have picked up recently, though they still remain soft. However, the uneasy calm that prevails in financial markets could be dispelled easily by a sudden return of risk-off investor sentiment on incoming data, especially pertaining to China or to US inflation. On the domestic front, gross value added (GVA) in agriculture and allied activities moderated in H2 of 2015-16, pulled down by the contraction in Q3 due to the year-on-year decline in kharif production. Turning to Q4, second advance estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture indicate that despite acutely low reservoir levels and a deficient north-east monsoon, rabi foodgrains production increased over its level a year ago  mainly in wheat and pulses  and compensated partly for the shortfall in kharif output. Unseasonal rains and hail in March are likely to have damaged some winter crops, particularly wheat, although full estimates of the crop loss await advance estimates. On the other hand, fertiliser production has picked up, and horticulture as well as allied activities have remained resilient, suggesting that the implicit estimate of GVA for agricultural and allied activities in Q4 in the CSO's advance estimates is likely to be achieved, if not revised upwards. Value added in industry accelerated in H2, led by manufacturing which benefited from the sustained softness in input costs. By contrast, industrial production remained flat with manufacturing output shrinking since November. Robust expansion in coal output has buoyed both mining activity and electricity generation and stemmed the weakening of industrial output. However, capital goods production fell into deep contraction since November, even after excluding lumpy and volatile items like rubber insulated cable. Weak demand and competition from imports have muted the capex cycle. Consumer non-durables production has been shrinking, with a pronounced decline in Q4. This reflects the continuing slack in rural demand. On the other hand, consumer durables remained strong, even after abstracting from favourable base effects, which suggests that urban demand is holding up. With improved perceptions on overall economic conditions and income, the Reserve Bank's Consumer Confidence Survey of March 2016 shows marginal improvement in consumer sentiments. The March manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) continued in expansionary mode on the back of new orders, including exports. The3 Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey suggests that business expectations for Q1 of 2016-17 continue to be positive. Services sector activity expanded steadily through the year, with trade, hotels, transport, communication and public administration, defence and related services turning out to be the main drivers in H2. The construction sector continues to be overburdened by unsold inventory in the residential space, although commercial real estate is being boosted by demand from information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services. Road construction has accelerated, including in terms of new awards. Cement production appears to have gained traction during H2, while steel consumption has increased at a steady pace. Various lead and coincident indicators such as air passenger traffic, air cargo volumes, foreign tourist arrivals and auto sales increased, while railway freight traffic marginally contracted. The services PMI remained in expansion mode during H2 on new business and expectations. The outlook for services in surveys is upbeat for Q1 of 2016-17. Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) dropped sharply in February after rising for six consecutive months. This favourable development was due to a larger than anticipated decline in vegetable prices, helped by prices of pulses starting to come off the surge that began in August, and effective supply management that helped limit cereal price increases. Accordingly, food inflation eased for the first time in the second half of 2015-16. Notably, this occurred on a decline in prices rather than favourable base effects, which were at work in the first half of the year. Inflation in the fuel group moderated across electricity, kerosene, cooking gas and firewood, the latter easing pressures on rural inflation. Three months ahead household inflation expectations declined to a single digit for the second consecutive round of the survey in response to these dynamics. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel edged up in February, mainly under housing, education, personal care and transport and communication, suggesting capacity constraints in the services sector. Excluding petrol and diesel from this category, inflation stayed elevated and persistent at or above 5 per cent, indicating a possible resistance level for further downward movements in the headline. The stubborn underlying inflation momentum is unlikely to be helped by the 7th Pay Commission award and the effects of the one-rank-one-pension (OROP) award, or by the cost-push effect of the increase in the service tax rate. However, rural wage growth as well as the rate of increase in corporate staff costs was moderate. Also, input and output prices polled in purchasing managers' surveys rose modestly for manufacturing and services. Liquidity conditions, which had tightened since mid-December, were stretched further by the larger-than-usual accumulation of cash balances by the Government, unusually heightened and persistent demand for currency, a pick-up in bank credit and flatter deposit mobilisation at this time relative to past years. The Reserve Bank undertook liquidity operations to quell these pressures and supplemented normal operations with large amounts of liquidity injected through fine-tuning variable rate repo auctions in tenors ranging between overnight and 56 days. The average daily liquidity injection (including variable rate overnight and term repos) increased from 1,345 billion in January to 1,935 billion in March. Besides, durable liquidity was also provided through open market operations (OMOs) of the order of 514 billion and 375 billion through buy-back operations in February and March. The Reserve Bank also started conducting reverse repo and MSF operations on holidays in Mumbai to enable the frictionless functioning of the payment and settlement system.4 10. Effective April 2, 2016 the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks was reduced by 25 basis points from 21.5 per cent to 21.25 per cent of their NDTL. Also, from February 2016, banks were allowed to reckon additional government securities held by them up to 3 per cent of their NDTL within the mandatory SLR requirement as level 1 high quality liquid assets (HQLA) for the purpose of computing their liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), thereby taking the total carve-out from SLR available to banks equivalent to 10 per cent of their NDTL. These measures will create space for banks to increase their lending to productive sectors on competitive terms so as to support investment and growth. FCNR(B) deposits and associated swaps undertaken in September 2013 are expected to mature starting September this year. It is important to note that these swaps are fully covered by the Reserve Bank's forward purchases. Moreover, the Reserve Bank will monitor developments closely to contain any unanticipated market volatility associated with the repayment. While exports declined in February in US dollar terms for the fifteenth successive month, the rate of contraction narrowed to a single digit for the first time in this period and volume growth turned positive. The decline in non-POL exports was even smaller, with gems and jewellery, drugs and pharmaceuticals, electronics and chemicals driving the upturn. The prolonged contraction in imports also slowed significantly, and non-POL non-gold import growth turned positive for the first time after seven months. This reflected a sizable upsurge in imports of machinery, supported by a pick-up in imports of pearls and precious stones and electronic goods. With gold imports falling in February and March, the continuing softness in crude prices working favourably in terms of conserving the POL import bill and some gains in terms of trade, the trade deficit narrowed to its lowest monthly level since September 2013. In turn, this has likely lowered the current account deficit (CAD) in Q4 below 1.3 per cent of GDP recorded in Q3, despite a moderation in net receipts from services exports and remittances. Net inflows in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI) were robust in Q4 (up to January), more than sufficient to fund the external financing requirement. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), who were net sellers in the domestic capital market up to February, became net buyers in March in both equity and debt segments. Policy Stance and Rationale 13. Inflation has evolved along the projected trajectory and the target set for January 2016 was met with a marginal undershoot. Going forward. CPI inflation is expected to decelerate modestly and remain around 5 per cent during 2016-17 with small inter-quarter variations (Chart 1). There are uncertainties surrounding this inflation path emanating from recent unseasonal rains, the likely spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon, the low reservoir levels by historical averages, and the strength of the recent upturn in commodity prices, especially oil. The persistence of inflation in certain services warrants watching, while the implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission awards will impart an upside to the baseline through direct and indirect effects. On the other hand, there will be some offsetting downside pressures stemming from tepid demand in the global economy. Government's effective supply side measures keeping a check on food prices, and the Central Government's commendable commitment to fiscal consolidation.5 14. The uneven recovery in growth in 2015-16 is likely to strengthen gradually into 2016-17, assuming a normal monsoon, the likely boost to consumption demand from the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission recommendations and OROP, and continuing monetary policy accommodation. After two consecutive years of deficient monsoon, a normal monsoon would work as a favourable supply shock, strengthening rural demand and augmenting the supply of farm products that also influence inflation. On the other hand, the fading impact of lower input costs on value addition in manufacturing, persisting corporate sector stress and risk aversion in the banking system, and the weaker global growth and trade outlook could impart a downside to growth outcomes going forward. The GVA growth projection for 2016-17 is accordingly retained at 7.6 per cent, with risks evenly balanced around it (Chart 2). In its bi-monthly monetary policy statement of February 2, 2016, the Reserve Bank indicated that it awaits further data on inflation as well as on structural reforms in the Union Budget that boost growth while controlling spending. Given recent data, forecasts in Chart 1 indicate that inflation will trend towards the 5 per cent target in March 2017 under reasonable assumptions. The changes to the RBI Act to create a6 Monetary Policy Committee will further strengthen monetary policy credibility. In the Union Budget for 2016-17, the Government has adhered to the path of fiscal consolidation and this will support the disinflation process going forward. The Government has also set out a comprehensive strategy for reinvigorating demand in the rural economy, enhancing the economy's social and physical infrastructure, and improving the environment for doing business and deepening institutional reform. The implementation of these measures should improve supply conditions and allow efficiency and productivity gains to accrue. Given weak private investment in the face of low capacity utilisation, a reduction in the policy rate by 25 bps will help strengthen activity and aid the Government's initiatives. Perhaps more important at this juncture is to ensure that current and past policy rate cuts transmit to lending rates. The reduction in small savings rates announced in March 2016, the substantial refinements in the liquidity management framework announced in this policy review and the introduction of the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) should improve transmission and magnify the effects of the current policy rate cut. The stance of monetary policy will remain accommodative. The Reserve Bank will continue to watch macroeconomic and financial developments in the months ahead with a view to responding with further policy action as space opens up. Part B: Developmental and Regulatory Policies 17. This part of the Statement reviews the progress on various developmental and regulatory policy measures announced by the Reserve Bank in recent policy statements and also sets out new measures to be taken for further refining the liquidity management framework; strengthening the banking structure; broadening and deepening financial markets and extending the reach of financial services to all. Liquidity Framework for Monetary Policy Operations 18. The Reserve Bank's liquidity framework was changed significantly in September 2014 in order to implement key recommendations of the Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework (Chairman: Dr. Urjit R Patel). With over six quarters of implementation history, it is appropriate to review the experience, with a view to making necessary adjustments as well as to more fully implement the report of the Expert Committee. Liquidity management is driven by two objectives: first, the need to supply or withdraw short term liquidity from the market so as to accommodate seasonal and frictional liquidity needs such as the build-up of Government balances and demand for cash; and second, the need to supply durable liquidity in the economy so as to facilitate growth, while ensuring that the monetary policy stance is supported. The Reserve Bank has kept the system in an ex ante deficit mode on average, with a liquidity shortfall equivalent to one per cent of banks' NDTL. The rationale has been that the banking system would borrow from the Reserve Bank's liquidity facilities, ensuring that the repo rate guided short term money market rates and thereby was effective as the policy rate. The first objective of meeting short term liquidity needs has been accomplished through the provision of liquidity by the Reserve Bank under its regular facilities - variable rate 14-day/7-day repo auctions equivalent to 0.75 per cent of banking system NDTL, supplemented by daily overnight fixed rate repos (at the repo rate) equivalent to 0.25 per cent of bank-wise NDTL. Frictional and seasonal mismatches that move the system away from normal liquidity provision are7 addressed through fine-tuning operations, including variable rate repo/reverse repo auctions of varying tenors. The weighted average call money rate has tracked the policy rate more closely than in the past, suggesting that short term liquidity needs have been adequately met. The Reserve Bank aims to meet the second objective by modulating net foreign assets (NFA) and net domestic assets (NDA) growth over the course of the year, broadly consistent with the demand for liquid assets to meet transaction needs of the economy. This will ensure adequate availability of durable liquidity, regardless of short term seasonal and frictional fluctuations. The Reserve Bank tries to smooth this growth over the year. So, for example, in periods when the Reserve Bank purchases significant quantities of NFA, the growth of NDA may have to be commensurately lower and may even have to be negative through the open market sale of domestic bonds. Experience suggests that the provision of short term liquidity does not substitute fully for needed durable liquidity, though durable liquidity can substitute for short term liquidity needs. Going forward, the Reserve Bank intends to first meet requirements of durable liquidity, and then use its fine-tuning operations to make short term liquidity conditions consistent with the intended policy stance. This may result in seemingly anomalous situations in which the Reserve Bank injects durable liquidity even when it is using short term instruments to withdraw excess short term liquidity, but such actions will be consistent with our dual objectives of liquidity management. Finally, given that new instruments such as variable rate reverse repo auctions allow the Reserve Bank to suck out excess short term liquidity from the system without the excess liquidity being deposited with the Reserve Bank through overnight fixed rate reverse repo, it is possible for the Reserve Bank to keep the system closer to balance on average without the operational rate falling significantly. Thus, the past rationale for keeping the system in significant average liquidity deficit no longer is as compelling, especially when the policy stance is intended to be accommodative. Moreover, given that the Reserve Bank's market operations rather than depositing or borrowing at standing facilities determine the operational interest rate, the policy rate corridor can be narrowed, as suggested by the Expert Committee. Therefore, it has been decided to: smooth the supply of durable liquidity over the year using asset purchases and sales as needed; progressively lower the average ex ante liquidity deficit in the system to a position closer to neutrality; narrow the policy rate corridor from +/-100 bps to +/- 50 bps, with a view to ensuring finer alignment of the WACR with the repo rate; ease liquidity management for banks without abandoning liquidity discipline by reducing the minimum daily maintenance of CRR from 95 per cent of the requirement to 90 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning April 16, 2016; allow substitution of securities in market repo transactions in order to facilitate development of the term money market; and8 consult with the Government on how to moderate the build-up of cash balances with the Reserve Bank. Detailed guidelines are being issued separately. The Reserve Bank will monitor the consequences of these changes as it modernises the country's liquidity framework. Banking Structure 26. Large Exposures: Taking into account the views and suggestions received from stakeholders on the discussion paper on ‘Large Exposures Framework and Enhancing Credit Supply through Market Mechanism', a fresh discussion paper will be issued by April 30, 2016 on large borrowers meeting a part of their funding requirements from markets. A draft circular on the Large Exposures Framework will be issued for public comments in June 2016 (to be implemented by January 1, 2019). Revision of regulatory framework: The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has issued final standards on the standardised approach for measuring counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR), a revised framework for the capital treatment of bank exposures to central counterparties (CCPs) and final rules on revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements. These standards will be implemented by January 1, 2017 by BCBS member jurisdictions. The Reserve Bank proposes to issue draft guidelines on these standards by May 31, 2016. The Reserve Bank will also undertake revision of the guidelines on the securitisation framework in the light of the BCBS revisions to the securitisation framework which is to be implemented by January 2018. It is proposed to issue draft guidelines on the revised securitisation framework by June 2016. Rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy: Currently, banks provide services through a variety of business outlets  branches; extension counters; satellite offices; mobile branches; ultra small branches and the like. The current policy approach is to facilitate adequate outreach of banking outlets in unbanked areas while at the same time providing autonomy to banks to decide their business strategy. Given that regulations are written in terms of branches, with a view to facilitating financial inclusion and providing flexibility on the choice of delivery channel, it is proposed to redefine branches and permissible methods of outreach keeping in mind the various attributes of the banks and the types of services that are sought to be provided. Differentiated Licensing of Banks: In addition to recently licensed differentiated banks such as payments banks and small finance banks, the Reserve Bank will explore the possibilities of licensing other differentiated banks such as custodian banks and banks concentrating on whole-sale and long-term financing. A paper in this regard will be put out for comments by September 2016. Margin Requirements for Over the Counter (OTC) Derivatives: In March 2015, the BCBS and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) finalised a framework on margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. A consultative paper outlining the Reserve Bank's approach to implementation of these requirements will be issued by end-April 2016 with a target of finalising the framework by end-July 2016. Countercyclical Capital Buffers (CCCB): A review and empirical testing of CCCB indicators was carried out by the Reserve Bank to assess whether activation of the CCCB is warranted and it has been decided that it is not necessary to activate CCCB at this point in time.9 32. Supervisory Enforcement Framework: Changes in the domestic and international financial sector environment necessitate formalisation of an improved supervisory framework for taking enforcement action against scheduled commercial banks for non-compliance of instructions and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank. The framework, which is intended to meet the principles of natural justice and global standards of transparency, predictability, standardisation, consistency, severity and timeliness of action, will be formalised by June 2016. Cyber Risks - Supervisory Assessment of Preparedness of Banks: The Reserve Bank has commenced detailed examination of IT used by banks on a pilot basis during the current year. IT examination reports are being issued separately so as to strengthen the information security preparedness of banks as well as to assess the effectiveness of IT adoption by banks. Moving forward, it is planned to cover major banks in 2016-17 and all banks from 2017-18. The Reserve Bank has constituted an Expert Panel (Chairperson: Smt. Meena Hemachandra) on IT Examination and Cyber Security to provide broad guidance on its approach. Technology Support to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs): As a part of the Memorandum of Understanding with the State Governments/Central Government on UCBs, the Reserve Bank had agreed to provide technology support to UCBs with the objective of financial inclusion and ensuring implementation of standardised core banking solutions (CBS). It has been decided to prescribe standards and benchmarks for CBS in UCBs and provide financial assistance and technical support through the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT). The initial set-up cost in this regard will be borne by the Reserve Bank while the recurring cost will be borne by the UCBs. A circular in this regard is being issued separately. Financial Markets 35. Introduction of Money Market Futures: The Working Group on Enhancing Liquidity in the Government Securities and Interest Rate Derivatives (Chairman: Shri R. Gandhi) had recommended introduction of interest rate futures based on the overnight call money borrowing rate. It is important to develop such market segments which could signal expectations of market participants, while allowing hedging of asset-liability mismatches. It has been decided to allow futures on an appropriate money market rate. The contract specifications will be decided in consultation with market participants and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) by end-September 2016. Easier Market Access to Gilt Account Holders: With a view to easing the process of investment by gilt account holders, it will be made incumbent on custodians to provide all gilt account holders access to the NDS-OM web facility to enable them to trade directly on the platform. A similar facility is also proposed to be extended to foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). Detailed guidelines in this regard will be issued by end-June 2016. Broadening Market Participation - Electronic Trading Platforms: In order to broaden participation in OTC derivatives and to provide a safe trading environment, it is proposed to put in place a policy framework for authorisation of electronic platforms with linkage to an approved central counterparty for settlement. The framework will also cover forex platforms to facilitate hedging by small and retail customers. The draft framework will be placed on the website for wider feedback by end-September 2016. Furthermore, in order to make participation in OTC derivative10 markets through electronic platforms more broad-based, it is proposed to review the existing guidelines on OTC derivatives. Guidelines will be issued by end-May 2016. Tripartite Repo in Government Securities Market: The Working Group on Enhancing Liquidity in the Government Securities and Interest Rate Derivatives (Chairman: Shri R. Gandhi) had recommended introduction of tripartite repo to develop a term repo market. In this context, it has been decided to undertake a comprehensive review of collateralised money market segments, including introduction of tripartite repo, in consultation with market participants. The review will be placed on the Reserve Bank's website by September 2016 for wider feedback. Review of Guidelines for Commercial Paper (CP): With a spurt in the issuance of CPs, market participants and the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association (FIMMDA) have expressed the need for greater transparency and better dissemination of information. Accordingly, it is proposed to undertake a comprehensive review of guidelines with the objective of, inter alia, strengthening disclosure requirements by issuers of CPs, reviewing the role of issuing and paying agents (IPAs) and putting in place an information dissemination mechanism. Draft guidelines in this regard will be issued by end-July 2016 for wider feedback. Guidelines for Accounting of Repo/Reverse Repo Transactions with the Reserve Bank: It is proposed to align the accounting norms to be followed by market participants for repo/reverse repo transactions under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) and the marginal standing facility (MSF) with the accounting guidelines prescribed for market repo transactions. Guidelines in this regard will be issued by end-May 2016. Easing of Restrictions on Plain Vanilla Forex Options: Currently, plain vanilla currency options require adherence to stringent suitability and appropriateness norms although they are considered a generic product, while forward contracts are exempt from the same. It is proposed to bring plain vanilla forex options bought by bank clients at par with forex forwards on regulatory requirements. Detailed guidelines will be issued by end-September 2016. Forex Benchmark-RBI Reference Rate: The Reserve Bank calculates and notifies the reference rate of the rupee (INR) against the US dollar and also publishes INR rates against the euro, the pound sterling and the yen every day around 1:30 P.M. These rates are based on quotes polled from a select list of contributing banks. As recommended by the Committee on Financial Benchmarks (Chairman: Shri P. Vijaya Bhaskar), it has been decided to move over to a process of determining the reference rate based on actual market transactions on volume weighted basis with effect from May 2, 2016. Allowing Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) to Participate in the Exchange Traded Currency Derivatives (ETCD) Market: It has been decided to permit NRIs to participate in the ETCDs, subject to limits and other conditions that are stipulated by the exchanges recognised by the SEBI. Guidelines in this regard will be issued by the Reserve Bank in consultation with the SEBI by end-June 2016. Initiatives for Start-ups: In the Sixth Bi-Monthly Monetary Policy Statement for 2015-16 and the press release dated February 2, 2016 the Reserve Bank had highlighted the steps being taken with respect to the Government's initiatives to promote ease of doing business for start-ups. Guidelines/clarifications have already been issued in areas such as online submission of Form A2 for outward remittances up to certain thresholds, issue of shares without cash payments and acceptance of11 payments by the Indian start-ups on behalf of their overseas subsidiaries. In addition, guidelines in respect of deferred payment through"
Poland,2016-04-06,"Warsaw, 6 April 2016 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 5-6 April 2016 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at:  reference rate at 1.50%;  lombard rate at 2.50%;  deposit rate at 0.50%;  rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic growth remains moderate, amid continuing heightened uncertainty about its outlook. Uncertainty regards, above all, the scale of economic slowdown in the emerging economies and its translation into lower activity in the advanced economies. In the euro area, economic recovery continues. Moderate growth is expected to continue in the coming quarters, although the slowdown in the emerging economies has a negative impact on the region's economic outlook. In the United States, after a slightly weaker GDP growth in the second half of 2015, economic conditions are still relatively good. Instead, economic slowdown in China continues, while Russia and Brazil are still in recession. Prices of oil and many other commodities in the global markets  despite some increase in the last two months  are still markedly lower than a year ago. Low commodity prices, combined with moderate global economic activity, are the main factor behind very low consumer price growth in many economies. In some economies  including in the euro area  price growth is negative. Against this background, the European Central Bank eased its monetary policy in March, lowering interest rates and increasing the scale of quantitative easing. At the same time, the Federal Reserve  after increasing interest rates in December  is keeping rates unchanged, while indicating a possible interest rate rise in the coming quarters. The decisions of the major central banks and the increase in oil prices have recently led to some improvement in global financial market sentiment and an increase in asset prices, including stock prices and exchange rates of emerging economies. In Poland, stable economic growth continues, although the data on industrial production and construction output signal that GDP growth in 2016 Q1 might have been slightly lower than in the previous quarter. Stable consumption growth and rising investment continue to support economic growth. The rise in consumer demand is driven by steady growth in employment and improving consumer sentiment. Growth in investment is supported by sound financial standing of enterprises, their high capacity utilization and the relatively favourable prospects for demand. This is accompanied by 1/2 stable lending growth. At the same time, economic growth is hampered by weakening external demand. As the output gap remains negative and average nominal wage growth is moderate, currently there is no inflationary pressure in the economy. Annual consumer price growth and producer price growth remain negative. However, external factors  particularly the earlier sharp fall in global commodity prices and low price growth in the environment of the Polish economy  continue to be the main reason for deflation. This is accompanied by very low inflation expectations. The persisting deflation has not adversely affected decisions of economic agents so far. In the Council's assessment, price growth will stay negative in the coming quarters due to the earlier fall in global commodity prices. At the same time, it will be accompanied by stable economic growth, including an expected rise in consumer demand growth driven by rising employment, forecasted acceleration of wage growth and an increase in social benefits. This notwithstanding, the downside risks to the global economic conditions and the volatility of commodity prices remain the sources of uncertainty for the domestic economy and price developments. The Council continues to assess that  given the available data and forecasts  the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance."
Pakistan,2016-04-09,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement April 09, 2016 After bottoming out in September 2015, both the Year-on-Year (YoY) headline CPI and period average inflation are on rising trend. While the YoY inflation rose from. percent in September 2015 to. percent in March 2016, the period average inflation increased from. percent to. percent during this period. Similarly the YoY core inflation measures kept their increasing trends; Non Food-Non Energy increased for the fifth consecutive month and the Trimmed Mean for the third month. Nevertheless this rise in inflation was anticipated and the benign inflation outlook for the remaining months of FY16 remains largely unchanged. However these trends in inflation indicate pickup in aggregate demand, amid both improved security situation and real incomes. This is reflected in rising demand for consumer durables, acceleration in construction activities, and expansion in services sector. Further uptick in credit to private sector, mainly owing to lower cost of borrowing, also supports this. Continuing increase in fixed investments for the fifth quarter remains noteworthy. With positive consumer sentiments and incremental lending rates at considerably lower levels, the uptake in credit to private sector is expected to end FY16 on higher level than that of FY15. At the same time, with improved business sentiments, lower input prices, and better energy availability, supply conditions have improved as well. Largely contributed by automobile, cement, and fertilizer sectors, large-scale manufacturing grew by. percent in Jul-Jan FY16, compared to. percent growth in Jul-Jan FY15. The improving large-scale manufacturing and industrial growth trends are expected to continue despite sector specific issues in steel, paper and board, and sluggish textile sector. Furthermore excess stock of major food items and the February 2016 pass-on of lower oil prices to domestic consumers are expected to keep downward pressure on inflation. This is also corroborated by decline in inflation expectations in the latest wave of IBA-SBP consumer confidence survey. In line with these developments, both money and foreign exchange markets exhibited relative tranquility in recent months. The cushion provided by decline in oil prices, inflow of remittances, and calmer international capital markets improved sentiments in the foreign exchange market. As result, in post January 2016 monetary policy period. PKR has remained stable in the interbank market. In the money market, volatility in the overnight repo rate was contained. The weighted average overnight repo rate stood at basis points above the policy rate in post January 2016 monetary policy period compared to being 21 basis points above in the post November 2015 monetary policy period. Thus KIBOR and market interest rates have declined depicting low inflation expectations for an extended period of time. However market's liquidity requirements Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN increased on account of continuing trend in retirement of government debt from SBP through enhanced borrowing from scheduled banks and higher private sector requirements. Despite an increase in development expenditures, budget deficit remained manageable in the first half of FY16. The improvement came from containment of current expenditures and sharp increase in tax revenues. Specifically the uptick of 14. percent has been recorded in federal tax revenues during first half of FY16 as compared to the marginal growth of. percent in the first half of FY15. Notwithstanding the pickup in quantum of oil imports along with high imports of machinery and transport equipment, trade balance stood at last year's level in Jul-Feb FY16. Even with rise in imports of machinery for some time and improvements in domestic conditions, exports continued to decline. However moderating growth in foreign remittances resulted in marginally narrowing down of the current account deficit. The increases in net flow of foreign direct investment and net foreign assistance during Jul-Feb FY16 kept the capital and financial account at nearly the same level as of last year. These developments resulted in keeping the overall balance of payments in surplus during this period and added to the official foreign exchange reserves. These trends are expected to persist and thus the balance of payments outlook for the remaining months of FY16 remains positive. However low private capital inflows pose challenge for medium term external sector sustainability. While the current macroeconomic stability, improved law and order, and China Pakistan Economic Corridor related investments bode well for the future prospects for foreign direct investments, it is the decline in exports receipts that is worrisome. General weakness in global trade further accentuates this risk. Hence the current improved domestic environment provides for the necessary conditions to inculcate better value addition and diversify products and markets for sustainable growth of exports. In view of the foregoing, the Monetary Policy Committee of the State bank of Pakistan has decided to maintain the policy rate at. percent. Page."
Chile,2016-04-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 12 April 2016 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3.5%. International financial markets have been relatively calm, showing mixed movements during the last month. In spite of this, risks remain. Long term interest rates of developed economies remain low, forecasts for world growth do not show relevant changes and commodity prices had mixed movements during this month. On the domestic front. March CPI inflation was lower than expected and its annual change was 4,5%. It is expected to remain over 4% for some months. Inflation expectations two years out remain at 3%. The evolution of these variables will continue to be monitored with special attention. Available activity data was higher than expected, but are still broadly in line with the baseline scenario of the Monetary Policy Report. Confidence indicators are still in pessimistic territory. The annual growth rate of salaried employment and the unemployment rate showed no major changes. The pace of annual wage growth decreased. In line with the Monetary Policy Report released in March, the Board estimates that to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target, monetary policy will need to continue with its normalization, at a pace that will depend on incoming information and its implications on inflation projections. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2016-04-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2016 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.25 percent. The Board has taken this decision considering that: The global economy continues showing mixed signals of recovery in terms of production and employment as well as lower volatility in financial markets. The rise in the prices of some food products and utilities as well as the depreciation of the sol against the dollar have been reversing. Inflation expectations have started to decrease. Local economic activity has been recovering. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to evaluate the convenience of making additional adjustments in the monetary policy rate. Inflation is expected to gradually return to be within the target range in a period of time similar to the monetary policy horizon. Inflation in March showed a rate of 0.60 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation fell from 4.47 percent in February to 4.3 percent in March. The lower monthly rate of inflation is explained by a partial reversal of food prices and by the lower exchange rate of the dollar against the sol. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.70 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation fell from 3.8 percent in February to 3.6 percent in March. In this month, the inflation rate expected for 2016 was 3.5 percent, while the rate expected for 2017 is estimated to range between 2.8 and 3.3 percent. Recent indicators of economic activity and business expectations show similar GDP growth rates to those of the potential output levels. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for May at the Board meeting that will be held on May 12, 2016."
South Korea,2016-04-19,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that indications of improvement, although weak, have appeared in the euro area. The economic slowdown in China has shown signs of easing a bit, but economic growth in other emerging market economies has continued to slow, centering around commodity-exporting countries. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that it will be affected by factors such as financial and economic conditions in emerging market countries, international oil price movements, and global financial market volatility. Looking at the Korean economy, the trend of decline in exports has continued but domestic demand activities such as consumption, and the sentiments of economic agents appear to be improving somewhat. On the employment front, the unemployment rate was somewhat higher in March compared to that in March of last year, owing mainly to an expansion in job search activities. The employment-to- population ratio was also increased, however, as the number of persons employed has steadily grown. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will show a trend of modest improvement going forward, centering around domestic demand activities, but in view of external economic conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be still high. Consumer price inflation fell from 1.3% the month before to 1.0% in March, owing chiefly to increases in the extents of decline in petroleum product prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also decreased slightly to 1.7%, from 1.8% in February. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will fall considerably short of the 2% inflation target for the time being, due mainly to the low oil prices. In the housing market, sales prices maintained their level of the previous month while the uptrend in leasehold deposit prices slowed. In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have risen and the Korean won has appreciated against the US dollar since March, as foreigners' securities investment funds have recorded net inflows on the effects of further monetary policy easing by major countries. After having appreciated against the Japanese yen, the won has depreciated somewhat against it again in line with the yen's strengthening. Long-term market interest rates have fallen back after having previously risen, in reflection mainly of interest rate movements in major countries. Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while working to support the recovery of economic growth the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon, and also pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor any changes in monetary policies or in financial and economic conditions in major countries, the movements of capital flows, and the trend of increase in household debt."
Turkiye,2016-04-20,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 10.50 percent to 10 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 12 percent to 11.50 percent. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports at an increasing pace, despite elevated geopolitical risks in other export markets. Recent data and the leading indicators show that economic activity displays a moderate and stable course of growth. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Recently, decline in the global volatility has continued and global financial conditions have improved. Along with these developments, the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August 2015 has reduced the need for a wide interest rate corridor. In this respect, the Committee decided to take a measured step towards simplification. Recently, inflation displayed a marked decline, which was mainly due to unprocessed food prices. This decline is expected to continue in the short run. However, improvement in the underlying core inflation trend remains limited, necessitating the maintenance of a tight liquidity stance. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Euroarea,2016-04-21,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, as decided on 10 March 2016, we have started to expand our monthly purchases under the asset purchase programme to €80 billion, from the previous amount of €60 billion. As stated before, these purchases are intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. Moreover, in June, we will conduct the first operation of our new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO and we will commence purchases under our corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP). Further information on the implementation aspects of the CSPP will be released after the press conference on the ECB's website. Following our comprehensive package of decisions taken in early March, broad financing conditions in the euro area have improved. The pass-through of the monetary policy stimulus to firms and households, notably through the banking system, is strengthening. Looking forward, it is essential to preserve an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation as long as needed in order to underpin the momentum of the euro area's economic recovery and in order to accelerate the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2%. The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely the evolution of the outlook for price stability and, if warranted to achieve its objective, will act by using all the instruments available within its mandate. In the current context, it is crucial to ensure that the very low inflation environment does not become entrenched in second-round effects on wage and price setting. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2015, supported by domestic demand, while being dampened by relatively weak export trends. Incoming data for the first quarter of 2016 point to ongoing output growth, at a pace broadly similar to that in the final quarter of 2015. Domestic demand, in particular, continues to be supported by our monetary policy measures. Their favourable impact on financing conditions, together with improvements in corporate profitability, is benefiting investment. Moreover, our accommodative monetary policy stance, continued employment gains resulting from past structural reforms and the still relatively low price of oil should provide ongoing support for households' real disposable income and private consumption. In addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is slightly expansionary. At the same time, the economic recovery in the euro area is still dampened by the ongoing balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors, the insufficient pace of implementation of structural reforms and subdued growth prospects in emerging markets. The risks to the euro area growth outlook still remain tilted to the downside. Our recent monetary policy decisions have improved overall financing conditions, which should support the outlook for consumption and investment. However, uncertainties persist and relate, in particular, to developments in the global economy and to geopolitical risks. According to Eurostat, euro area annual HICP inflation in March 2016 was 0.0%, compared with -0.2% in February, reflecting mainly a rise in services price inflation. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for energy, inflation rates could turn negative again in the coming months before picking up in the second half of 2016. Thereafter, supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should recover further in 2017 and 2018. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continued to grow at a robust pace in February 2016, with its annual rate of growth remaining unchanged at 5.0%. As in previous months, annual growth in M3 is mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 10.3% in February, after 10.5% in January. Loan dynamics followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 0.9% in February 2016, up from 0.6% in January. Developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.6% in February 2016, from 1.4% in January. The euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2016 indicates further improvements in loan supply conditions for enterprises and in loan demand across all loan categories. Improvements in the demand for bank loans were supported by the low level of interest rates, financing needs for investment purposes and housing market prospects. Overall, the monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 have clearly improved borrowing conditions for firms and households, as well as credit flows across the euro area. The comprehensive package of new monetary policy measures adopted in March this year underpins the ongoing upturn in loan growth, thereby supporting the recovery of the real economy. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need to preserve an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. As emphasised repeatedly by the Governing Council, and as strongly echoed in both European and international policy discussions, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the European levels. Structural policies are essential, given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area. In particular, actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase investment and boost job creation. The swift and effective implementation of structural reforms, in an environment of accommodative monetary policy, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also make the euro area more resilient to global shocks. Fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. Full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is crucial to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework. At the same time, all countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies."
Israel,2016-04-21,"Background conditions. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor March declined by 0.2 percent, a slightly greater decline than the average of forecasters' predictions for a decline of 0.1 percent. There was a seasonal price decline of 3.9 percent in the fruit and vegetables component, and there was a marked decline of 1.0 percent in the transport and communication component, against the background of the decline in fuel prices, as well as a decline of 0.5 percent in the food component against thebackground of price reductions initiated by the government. The inflation rate as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was -0.7 percent, compared with -0.2 percent in the 12 months ending in February. Excluding the direct effect of energy prices and administrative price reductions, inflation over the past 12 months was 0.7 percent. Prices of components representing tradable goods in the CPI declined by 3.4 percent over the past 12 months, and the prices of components representing nontradable items increased by 0.8 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Following the increase in inflation expectations last month, they remained relatively stable this month. Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings are for an increase of 0.8 percent, on average, (compared with 0.6 percent in the previous month). Expectations for inflation over the coming 12 months derived from banks' internal interest rates are 0.1 percent (similar to last month), and inflation expectations derived from the capital market are 0.1 percent (compared with 0.2 percent in the previous month). Medium-term and long-term forward expectations also remained stable: Three-year expectations remained at 1.3 percent, while medium-term (3-5 years) and long-term (5 C2 AD-10 years) expectations declined by 0.1 percentage points (to 1.4 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively). The makam curve and the Telbor curve increased slightly in recent weeks, and do not indicate any change expected in the interest rate in the next year. According to the average of projections by private forecasters, the Bank of Israel interest rate is expected to remain at its current level over the next three months. Real economic activity: Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month point to the economy continuing to grow at its moderate rate of recent years. After growth accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2015, some moderation is apparent in the first quarter of 2016. Growth still mainly reflects an increase in private consumption, while exports apparently continue to decline. Goods exports (excluding ships and aircraft and diamonds, in current dollar terms) declined sharply in the first quarter, by 4.6 percent, while imports (excluding shipsand aircraft, diamonds, and fuel, in current dollar terms), increased by 1.2 percent during the same period. The Composite State of the Economy Indexincreased by 0.2 percent in March, led by an increase in the Industrial Production Index and in the Retail Trade Revenue Index readings for February,and in consumer goods imports in March. The Companies Survey for the firstquarter indicates that business sector activity resumed its expansion at the moderate growth rate that characterized it in recent years, after a slight acceleration in the previous quarter. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by Bank Hapoalim continued to increase in March. The Purchasing Managers Index increased to 49.0 points in March, but is still at a level indicating contraction of activity. The labor market: The picture conveyed by the labor market continues to be positive. Labor Force Survey data for the first quarter indicates that the unemployment rate among the prime working ages (25-64) remains at a low level of 4.5 percent. There was a slight decline in the employment rate (to 76.0 percent, from 76.2 percent in the fourth quarter) and in the participation rate (to 79.6 percent, from 79.9 percent). The job vacancy rate in March remained high, at around 3.7 percent. Real wages increased by 0.3 percent (seasonally adjusted) in November-January, compared with the three previous months, while nominal wages declined by 0.15 percent, after the growth rate of wages in most industries accelerated in the past two years. The number of employee posts remains elevated, despite a slight decline of 0.3 percent in January relative tothe last quarter. Health tax receipts for January-March were 6.1 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period in the year before, reflecting the increase in employment and wages. Budget data: The cumulative domestic surplus (excluding net credit) in government activity was NIS 1.5 billion in January-March 2016, compared with a surplus of approximately NIS 2.2 billion in the corresponding period of 2015, and it is about NIS 1.5 billion higher than the seasonal path consistent with achieving the deficit target for 2016. Tax revenues in March increased slightly compared with previous months, to NIS 24.0 billion, which is NIS 0.2 billion higher than the seasonal path consistent with the estimate of tax revenue. Tax revenues in January-March were about 7 percent higher in real terms than in the corresponding period of the previous year (based on an estimate that nets outthe effects of extraordinary activities and legislative changes). Gross domestic VAT collection, net of the effect of legislative changes, increased by about 7 percent in real terms in March, following a moderate increase of 1.7 percent in February. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on March 27, 2016, through April 19, 2016, the shekel strengthened by 2.1 percent against the dollar and by 1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the preceding 12 months, theshekel appreciated by 5.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on March 27, 2016, throughApril 19, 2016, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 1.9 percent, in line with the global trend. Government bonds yields declined by up to 15 basis points, excluding short-term nominal yields (up to 4 years). The makam curve traded at a yield ranging around the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, continued to decline, to about 76 basis points. The money supply: In the 12 months ending in March, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 28.2 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexeddeposits of up to one year) increased by 10.2 percent. The credit market: In March, the business sector (excluding banks and insurance companies) issued bonds totaling just NIS 1.6 billion, after issuances totaled NIS 4.0 billion in February. Inaddition, in continuation of the previous months' trend, there were three offerings by foreign real estate companies in March, totaling NIS 1.3 billion. Mutual fund withdrawals have been decreasing since the beginning of the year, and withdrawals in March totaled NIS 1.8 billion, compared with NIS 3.7 billion in February and NIS 6.1 billion in January. Funds specializing in corporate bonds and in equities in Israel even switched to net new investment. Corporate bond spreads were about 3.9 percentage points, on average, in the first third of April, a decline of about 0.5 percentage points from the end of February. In March, the total volume of new mortgages taken out was NIS 5.3 billion, and the flow of mortgages extended over the previous 12 months remains high, at about NIS 65 billion. There was a mixed trend in the interest rate on new mortgages issued in March. There was an increase of 6 basis points in the variable-rate unindexed track, while therewas a decline of 11 basis points in the variable-rate. CPI-indexed track. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.4 percent in March, after increasing by 0.1 percent in February. The rate of home prices increases moderated slightly in recent months, but remains high. Home prices increased by 0.1 percent in January-February, and by 7.2 percent in the 12 months ending in February, lower than the annual increase recorded in the previous month (7.8 percent). The number of transactions remains elevated. More than 8,000 transactions per month were carried out over the past four months, with a resumption of the increase in the number of transactions by investors: which had moderated after the purchase tax on investment transactions increased in July. The stock of new homes available for sale remains approximately 29,600 homes, a historically high level. The volume of new-home sales is about 2,300 per month, on average, over the past four months, which is too low to reduce the stock of new homes available for sale. The scope of building starts in the past two years indicates that building completions are expected to remain at a high level in the coming quarters as well. The global economy: This month, there was a continuation of the trend of moderation in global economic activity: particularly in developing economies and in Japan. In Europe, data indicate continued moderate growth of activity. In the US, activity data indicate a loss of momentum and a marked slowdown in the first quarter, and thegrowth rate in China continues to slow. Stock market indices continued to increase this month, against the background of a continued recovery of oil prices, and risk indices remained low. For the second time this year, the IMF revised its global growth and world trade forecasts for 2016-2017, raising its assessment of risks derived from the financial markets and from developing economies. The growth forecast for 2016 was revised downwardfrom 3.4 percent to 3.2 percent, and the forecast for 2017 was revised downward from 3.6 percent to 3.5 percent. In particular, growth projections for Japan and for some developing economies were lowered, while projected growth in China was revised upward. The forecast for world trade for 2016 was revised downward from 3.4 percent to 3.1 percent, and for 2017 it was revised downward from 4.1 percent to 3.8 percent. The main message from central banks worldwide remains dovish, and leaves open the possibility of additional accommodative steps. The dovish tone of the March monetary policy decision continued in the speech by the Chair of the Federal Reserve, following which the probability reflected in the markets of an interest rate increase in the US declined, with an interest rate increase fully priced in to the markets only in July 2017. A significant slowdown in the personal consumption growth rate in the first quarter is becoming apparent in the US. The GDPNow index was revised sharply downward against the background of disappointing macroeconomic data, and it now projects an annual growth rate of just 0.3 percent in the first quarter. However, leading indicators are signaling an improvement ahead of the second quarter. The employment report continued to indicate high numbers of new jobs, with 215,000 jobs added to nonfarm payrolls in March, and the average hourly wage increased by 0.3 percent, reflecting an annual growth of 2.3 percent. The unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points to 5.0 percent, mainly against the background of a similar increase in the participation rate. In Europe, activity data continueto indicate moderate growth that relies mostly on private consumption. Theinflation environment remained weak, with the annual inflation rate increasing in March from -0.2 percent to zero. The euro continues to strengthen, despite the aggressive accommodative steps. In the UK, the Bank of England kept its interest rate unchanged, but warned that a possible vote to leave the European Union would have negative ramifications for the labor market, the exchange rate, and demand. The Japanese economy continues to suffer from weak domestic demand and from a slowdown in its main export destinations,mainly in East Asia, alongside a strengthening yen. These developments maylead to additional monetary and fiscal accommodation measures in the coming months. Leading indicators in emerging markets indicate some improvement in March, mainly in the manufacturing sector, but they remain very low. TheChinese economy grew at an annual rate of 6.7 percent in the first quarterof 2016, compared with 6.8 percent at the end of 2015. Data on activity for March indicate improvement following a slowdown in January-February data. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil continued to increase this month, to around $43. The index of commodities excluding energy did not change significantly this month up to the end of the reviewed period. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for May 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. In view of developments in the inflation environment, in growth in Israel and in the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, the Monetary Committee continues to assess that monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. C 2B 7 The inflation environment remains low, against the background of price reductionsinitiated by the government and low energy prices. Inflation expectations stabilized this month, after increasing last month. One-year inflation expectations remain below the target range, and expectations for the medium andlong terms continue to be anchored within the target range. C 2B 7 The picture of real economic activity continues to portray growth at the moderaterate that characterized it in recent years. The Companies Survey indicatesthat activity moderated in trade and services industries as well. Goods exports declined sharply in the first quarter. Labor market data remain positive, reflected in a low level of unemployment, an increase in wages and in health tax receipts, and a high job vacancy rate. C 2B 7 The moderation in global economic activity continued this month, and the IMF again revised downward its forecasts for growth in most major economies and for world trade, while the forecast for growth in China was revised upward. The monetary policy of major central banks continues tobe very accommodative. The markets' expected timing of an additional increase in the US federal funds rate was deferred, and other central banks continue to point to the possibility of enhancing monetary accommodation. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on March 27, 2016, through April 19, 2016, the shekel strengthened by 2.1 percent against the US dollar and by 1.0 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the past 12 monthsthere has been an appreciation of 5.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and the exchange rate level continues to weigh on growth of exports and the tradable sector. C 2B 7 The rate of increase in home prices moderated slightly in recent months but it remains high, as does the volume of new mortgages taken out. The stock of homes available for sale remains elevated, and the high level of activity in the construction industry is expected to continue contributing to an increase in supply. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to achieving the inflation target and to growth remain high. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for May 2016 will be published on May 5, 2016. The decision regarding the interest rate for June 2016 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. May 23, 2016."
Ukraine,2016-04-21,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the key policy rate to 19%, effective from 22 April 2016. This was made possible due to a further alleviation of risks to price stability. At the same time, the NBU has streamlined the operational framework of monetary policy. This move has been prompted by the need to enhance the effectiveness of monetary instruments to strengthen the NBU's capacity to implement monetary policy in the context of inflation targeting. In March 2016, as expected, the disinflation trend continued, with annual headline inflation moderating to 20.9%. Core inflation continued to ease to 15.0% y-o-y. Overall, headline inflation rose by 1.5% q-o-q, underperforming the NBU's inflation forecast. Inflationary pressures have been dampened due to the authorities' commitment to prudent monetary and fiscal policy, subdued domestic demand, and stabilization of inflation expectations. The temporary surge in exchange rate volatility observed in January-February 2016 had a relatively limited impact on the inflation rate because factors exerting pressure on the exchange rate also contributed to an increased supply of foods, thus bringing domestic prices down. The NBU's measures in the FX market were aimed at smoothing excessive exchange rate fluctuations, which also helped contain inflation pressures. In March, the FX market stabilized due to a rebound in demand and prices for Ukrainian export commodities, which led to the strengthening of the hryvnia exchange rate. The NBU has kept its headline inflation projection unchanged at 12% by the end of 2016 and 8% by the end of 2017, which is consistent with its inflation objectives. Most factors causing inflation to deviate from the projected path in the first quarter are believed to be short-lived, with a high likelihood of their reversal over the next quarters. The disinflation trend will be supported by the authorities' commitment to prudent fiscal policy and the pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation observed in March-April 2016. The NBU has kept its 2016 outlook for economic activity unchanged. Real GDP is expected to rise by 1.1% in 2016 and by 3% in 2017. In particular, the NBU has also kept its forecast for the current account deficit unchanged (USD 2.3 billion or 2.7% of GDP in 2016 and USD 1.8 billion or 1.9% of GDP in 2017). Inflation pressures and downside risks to inflation projections, which prevented the NBU from easing monetary policy in the first quarter of 2016, have significantly abated since the previous NBU Board's monetary policy meeting. In particular, with the formation of a new government, political tensions have eased. External risks have also abated due to the resumption of transit of Ukrainian goods through the territory of the Russian Federation and a gradual recovery in prices for key Ukrainian export commodities. However, delays with the resumption of cooperation with the International Monetary Fund remain the major downside risk to inflation projections. The new Government's commitment to proceed with urgent reforms is essential to getting the program back on track. Should risks to price stability abate further, and if Ukraine secures the successful completion of the second review under the Extended Fund Facility Arrangement, the NBU may move ahead with monetary easing. Additionally, the NBU Board has decided to streamline the operational framework of monetary policy. From now on, the NBU will set the discount rate at the level of the key policy interest rate. In the current situation, where the banking system has surplus liquidity, the rate on 14-day certificate of deposits serves as the key policy rate. The 14-day deposit-taking operations, which account for the largest share of all the certificates of deposit (CD) placed with banks, have a key impact on money market conditions. Identifying a single policy rate through the convergence of the discount rate and the 14-day CD interest rate (currently set at 19%) will improve the first link of the chain of cause-and-effect of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and therefore increase its effectiveness to steer short-term interbank market interest rates. Going forward, changes in the key policy rate as the key reference interest rate and policy-induced changes in interest rates will be translated into changes in interest rates on other financial assets (in particular, government securities) and retail interest rates on loans and deposits. The clarity and predictability of key policy rate adjustments will contribute to increasing the effectiveness of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy through which the NBU steers inflation towards inflation objectives. As part of the efforts to redesign the operational framework of monetary policy, the NBU has streamlined the procedures and liquidity management instruments. First, the NBU has narrowed the corridor of interest rates on standing facilities around the key policy rate. The interest-rate corridor is symmetric around the key policy rate. The top of the interest rate corridor is the interest rate on standing overnight refinance facilities, which is 200 basis points above the NBU key policy rate. The bottom of the interest rate corridor is the interest rates on the overnight deposit facility, which is 200 basis points below the NBU key policy rate. Second, the NBU has ceased the practice of holding CD placement tenders at maturities of less than 14 days. On one hand, this move will boost the development of the interbank credit market. On the other hand, the key policy rate will convey a clearer signal of changes in the stance of monetary policy. Third, the NBU will conduct all liquidity-providing operations at a single interest rate equal to the rate on overnight loans. And fourth, the NBU has disallowed the early repayment of NBU CDs. The NBU Board believes that the current economic situation and the balance of risks enable the regulator to resume easing of FX controls following the resumption of cooperation with the IMF. The decision on the key policy rate is approved by NBU Board Resolution No. 278, dated 21 April 2016. On Money Market Regulation. The decision on redesigning the operational framework of monetary policy is approved by NBU Board Resolution No. 277 dated 21 April 2016. On Interest Rate Policy. A detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 25 April 2016. The next meeting of the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine on monetary policy issues will be held on 26 May 2016, as scheduled."
Georgia,2016-04-27,"27.04.2016 NBG Reduces Its Policy Rate By 50 Basis Points To 7.5% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on April 27, 2016 and decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 50 basis points to 7.5 percent. The monetary policy decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, which confirms that the tightening of the monetary policy by the NBG throughout 2015 reflected positively on the decrease in inflation expectations. According to the current forecast the annual inflation will decrease at a moderate rate in the coming quarters, temporarily keeping below the current target value and will reach the latter by the end of the year. The decrease in the inflation forecast was to a significant extent due to the drop in inflation expectations. The annual inflation in March dropped to 4.1% (compared to 5.6% in February). This decrease in the annual inflation was largely due to the expiration of base effects coming from one-time factors and decrease in inflation expectations. According to the current NBG forecasts the economic growth in 2016 will be around 3.0%. Recently factors like increased investment activity, particularly in construction, have had positive effect on the economic growth. This trend is expected to continue this year. However increased interest rates on Lari-denominated loans and the overall decline in the credit portfolio growth rates weakens the aggregate demand. Another factor keeping the economic growth low is the negative impact of the economic situation in Georgia's trade partners, reflected in the decrease of remittances and weakening of external demand. Based on the aforementioned the Monetary Policy Committee considers necessary to start phasing out the tight monetary policy, which means the gradual reduction of the refinancing rate down to the neutral level in the medium-term. According to the NBG estimations the neutral policy rate in the medium term is around 5-6 percent. Therefore the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 50 basis points. The rate of further monetary policy softening will depend on the revised inflation forecasts. At the same time in order to encourage the attraction of funds in GEL the Monetary Policy Committee decided to reduce the minimum reserve requirement on the attracted funds in GEL from 10% to 7%. At the same time, in order to mitigate potential risks affecting the financial stability the minimum reserve requirement on the funds attracted in foreign currency has been increased from 15% to 20%. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on June 15, 2016."
United States,2016-04-27,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that labor market conditions have improved further even as growth in economic activity appears to have slowed. Growth in household spending has moderated, although households' real income has risen at a solid rate and consumer sentiment remains high. Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has improved further but business fixed investment and net exports have been soft. A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to additional strengthening of the labor market. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and falling prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Stanley Fischer; Loretta J Mester; Jerome H Powell; Eric Rosengren; and Daniel K Tarullo. Voting against the action was Esther L George, who preferred at this meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. Implementation Note issued April 27, 2016."
Egypt,2016-04-28,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release April 28, 2016 In its meeting held on April 28, 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 1075 percent, 1175 percent, and 1125 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1125 percen. Annual headline CPI remained at around 9 percent in February and March 2016, after registering 10 percent in January 2016 and 11 percent in December 201. On the other hand, annual core CPI increased to 84 percent in March from 75 percent in Februar. Monthly developments have been largely driven by the rise in food price. Looking ahead, while the upside risks to the domestic inflation outlook are mitigated by contained imported inflation, in light of the subdued international commodity prices, potential underlying domestic inflationary pressures are still under watc. Preliminary data reveal that during 2015/16 H1 GDP at market prices grew by 35 percen. Growth came mainly from the construction and real estate services, despite the continued contraction in tourism and the weaknesses in the extractions secto. In the meantime, growth was largely driven by consumption, in addition to a positive contribution of investmen. On the other hand, net exports contributed negatively to GDP in H1, driven by weaker exports, while imports have been contributing positively, given their relative declin. Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects are expected to continue to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround the global economy could pose downside risks to domestic GD. At this juncture, and given the expected lagged effect from the previous interest rate hike, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlook. The MPC reiterates its price stability mandate and will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, particularly fiscal policy and its effect on the inflation outlook, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Colombia,2016-04-29,"Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 50 bp to 7.0%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In March, annual consumer inflation and the average of core inflation measures increased and stood at 7.98% and 6.29%, respectively. Analysts' inflation expectations to one and two years registered 4.5% and 3.8%, respectively, and those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years are between 4.4% and 4.8%. The strong increase in food prices as well as nominal depreciation and its partial pass-through to consumer prices continue explaining the increase in inflation. Although they are considered temporary shocks, the magnitude of the depreciation of the peso and the intensity of. have increased the risk of a slower convergence of inflation to the target, due to its direct impact on prices and inflation expectations, as well as to the triggering of indexation mechanisms. The new information on global economic activity suggests that in 2016, average growth of the country's trading partners will be weak and lower to the one registered in 2015. In the United States, the Federal Reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate unaltered, and a slower tightening of monetary policy in that country is more likely. The price of oil increased, and posted above the expectations of the technical staff for this year. In this environment, risk measures for the country fell, and the peso appreciated vis--vis the US dollar. The data for the first quarter of 2016 indicates that consumption grew at a rate similar to the one registered a quarter ago, and that investment slowed down. On the supply side, indicators of industry, retail trade, and coffee production suggest a favorable behavior, while mining reported deterioration. Under these conditions, for the first quarter of this year, the technical staff forecasts a most probable growth figure of 2.5%, within a range of 1.8% to 3.2%. For all 2016, the growth forecast would be between 1.5% and 3.2%, with 2.5% as the most likely outcome. For 2016, a reduction in the current account deficit both in US dollars (15,948 million) and as a proportion of GDP (5.9%) is expected. In all, high increases in food prices and partial pass-through of depreciation to domestic prices continue to exert inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations remain high. This takes place within a context of excessive expenditure over national income, and in which the risk of an excessive deceleration of domestic demand continues to be moderated. In order to ensure convergence of inflation to the target in 2017, and to contribute to the reduction of the current account deficit, the Board of Directors decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 50 bp. The Board will continue monitoring the expected adjustment of expenditure and its consistency with the income level for long-term sustainability of the external deficit, and, in general, for macroeconomic stability. Similarly, it reaffirms its commitment to maintaining inflation and inflation expectations anchored to the target, acknowledging that there has been a transitory increase in inflation. Bogot."
Russia,2016-04-29,"On 29 April 2016, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep its key rate at 11.00% p.a. The Board of Directors sees the positive processes of inflation slowdown and inflation expectations decline, as well as shifts in the economy which anticipate the beginning of its recovery growth. At the same time, inflation risks remain elevated. These risks primarily stem from slowly declining inflation expectations against the target, uncertainty in parameters of the national budget, and ambiguity of the observed movements in nominal wages. Moving forward, should inflation risks fall as much as to ensure with greater certainty that the Bank of Russia achieves its inflation target, the Bank of Russia will resume a gradual lowering of its key rate at one of its forthcoming Board meetings. The Bank of Russia predicts, consistent with the decision, the annual inflation to stand at about 5% in April 2017, to reach the 4% target in late 2017. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors has proceeded from the following factors. First. Inflation fell perceptibly; however, the trend bears risks of instability. Slower consumer price growth is triggered by weak demand and gradually descending inflation expectations, driven by, inter alia, the moderately tight monetary policy. Meanwhile, the factors, which are likely to have a temporary impact, have also made a considerable contribution to inflation reduction. They include the Government's decisions on indexation of wages, pensions, administrated prices and tariffs, as well as a drop in global food prices. Under the Bank of Russia estimates, the annual consumer price growth rate is down to 7.3% as of 25 April 2016 / as of 25 April 2016 remained at the level of March 2016 of 7.3%. This is in line with the inflation forecast for the year ahead, which the Bank of Russia published in its April 2015 press release (below 8%). In mid-2016, the annual consumer price growth is likely to accelerate temporarily owing to the low-base effect of the previous year. However, further on inflation will continue to go down. The Bank of Russia predicts, consistent with the decision, the annual inflation to stand at about 5% in April 2017, to reach the 4% target in late 2017. Second. Key macroeconomic indicators show higher resistance of the Russian economy to fluctuations in oil prices. The floating exchange rate partially sets off the negative impact of external shocks. The development of import substitution and expansion of non-commodity exports make a positive contribution to industrial production dynamics. Capacity utilisation indicators have improved. The on-going shifts in the economy anticipate the beginning of its recovery growth. Quarterly GDP growth is expected to reach positive territory in 2016 H2 — early 2017. Third. Interest rates in the economy are set to decline further even with the key rate unchanged. This is mainly driven by the planned Reserve Fund spending to finance the budget deficit and the ensuing changeover in the banking sector to a liquidity surplus. Fourth. There remain elevated inflation risks. These primarily stem from slowly declining inflation expectations against the inflation target, mixed data on movements being observed in nominal wages, uncertainty in parameters of further wages and pensions indexation, and from the absence of mid-term budget consolidation strategy. Due to the continued supply glut in the oil market, the risks of crude prices dropping and their negative pressure on exchange rate and inflation expectations remain high enough. Moving forward, should inflation risks fall as much as to ensure with greater certainty that the Bank of Russia achieves its inflation target, the Bank of Russia will resume a gradual lowering of its key rate at one of its forthcoming Board meetings. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 10 June 2016. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30. Moscow time. Interest rates on the Bank of Russia's major operations1(p.a.). 1Information on interest rates on all Bank of Russia operations is given in the Table 'Interest Rates on the Bank of Russia Operations'. 2 Floating interest rate linked to the level of the Bank of Russia key rate. 3 Fine-tuning operations.

Czech Republic,2016-05-05,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the CNB still stands ready to intervene automatically, i.e. without the need for an additional decision of the Bank Board, and without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until mid-2017. Consistent with the forecast is an increase in market interest rates thereafter. Inflation is still well below the CNB's target of 2%. According to the new forecast, inflation will decline temporarily close to zero in the near future, mainly due to cost-push effects from abroad. However, it will then increase, hitting the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon. According to the forecast, sustainable fulfilment of the target, which is a condition for a return to conventional monetary policy, will occur from mid-2017. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being slightly anti-inflationary. A need to maintain expansionary monetary conditions at least to the current extent persists. The Bank Board therefore states again that the CNB will not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017. The Bank Board considers it likely that the commitment will be discontinued in mid-2017. Domestic inflation is still being affected by strong anti-inflationary cost-push effects from abroad, the intensity and duration of which are greater than assumed in the previous forecasts. Monetary policy looks past the first-round effects of such factors and focuses on any adverse second-round effects. The CNB therefore stands ready to move the exchange rate commitment to a weaker level if there were to be a systematic decrease in inflation expectations manifesting itself in nominal variables, especially wages. Turning to the assumptions of the new forecast regarding developments abroad. GDP growth in the effective euro area will fluctuate around 2%. The previous sharp decline in energy commodity prices is reflected in an outlook for subdued growth in industrial producer prices, which will not return to annual growth until the start of next year. Consumer price inflation will rise gradually from very low levels, but will again stay below 2% next year. The ECB responded to the subdued inflation by further easing monetary policy. This is reflected in the market outlook for 3M Euribor rates, which is negative until the end of 2017. The Brent crude oil price will rise slowly amid a relatively stable euro-dollar exchange rate. Domestic inflation increased slightly in 2016 Q1, but remains well below the 2% target. The slightly positive inflation was due to the return of administered prices to annual growth and to still markedly positive adjusted inflation excluding fuels. This indicator of core inflation reflects the positive effect of growth in the domestic economy and wages. By contrast, prices of food and fuels declined as a result of persisting anti-inflationary supply shocks from abroad. Headline inflation will decline temporarily close to zero in the near future owing to a renewed decrease in administered prices, a deepening of the decline in food prices and a temporary slowdown in adjusted inflation. A dip into negative territory cannot be ruled out either. Inflation will thus remain below the target for a longer time on account of positive cost effects. At the close of this year, however, inflation will start to increase, hitting the target at the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in 2017 Q2 and Q3, and then slightly exceeding it. The domestic economy will continue to foster a rise in consumer prices amid continuing economic growth and rising wages. At the same time, the current strongly anti-inflationary effect of import prices, stemming from a fall in producer prices in the euro area, will fade gradually. Monetary policy-relevant inflation will differ only marginally from headline inflation, as a result of only small first-round effects of indirect tax changes. It will thus turn slightly negative in the near future, but will hit the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon. The growth of the Czech economy will slow to 2.3% this year from the exceptionally high level recorded last year. This will be due mainly to a fall in government investment as a result of an only gradual start to the drawdown of EU funds in the new programme period. On the other hand, growth in economic activity will continue to be supported by easy domestic monetary conditions, low oil prices and rising external demand. After the fall in government investment fades out. GDP growth will accelerate to over 3% next year. The rising economic activity will manifest itself in continued growth in employment. This will result in a further, albeit only modest, decrease in the unemployment rate. Wages will rise at a steady pace this year and accelerate further next year. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until mid-2017. This is one of the factors helping inflation to return to the target in the first half of next year according to the forecast. Consistent with the forecast is an increase in market interest rates in the second half of 2017. According to the forecast, the return to conventional monetary policy will not result in the exchange rate appreciating sharply to the slightly overvalued level recorded before the CNB started intervening, among other things because the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to the price level and other nominal variables. At the same time, the Bank Board stated again that exchange rate appreciation following the discontinuation of the exchange rate commitment would be dampened by hedging of exchange rate risk by exporters during the existence of the commitment, by the closing of koruna positions by financial investors and by possible CNB interventions to mitigate exchange rate volatility. Compared to the previous forecast, the inflation prediction is markedly lower until mid-2017, owing to lower observed prices (especially food prices), a more subdued outlook for foreign producer prices and lower growth in domestic nominal wages. GDP growth in 2016 has been revised downwards, mainly as a result of a deeper fall in government investment and slower growth in private investment. By contrast, the growth forecast for 2017 has been raised slightly, partly reflecting an extension by two quarters of the expected duration of interest rate stability and the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument. Nominal wage growth is more moderate until the middle of next year, due to the halt in nominal wage acceleration observed at the close of last year and the outlook for more subdued inflation and economic growth."
Kazakhstan,2016-05-05,"P R E S S-R E L E A S E #9 On the base rate May 5, 2016 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to lower the base rate to 15% with a band of +/- 1 percentage points from the base rate. Since the last decision on rate (March 14, 2016), the balance of risks between price stability and financial stability has improved, thus weakening the case for high interest rates. As assessed by the National Bank, various metrics of expected inflation began to show signs of abating, the recovery of market confidence in tenge- denominated assets gained strength, and the cost of hedging foreign currency risks have declined. Recent trends were shaped, in part, by the National Bank's commitment to the policy of free float, as well as the success in consolidating money market rates at a level that ensures demand for tenge-denominated assets. Most recent annual consumer inflation (for the 12 months ending April 2016) remains high at 16.3%, but a total of 10.4% came from just three consecutive months from October to December, during which the pass-through of exchange rate was most significant. By now, we estimate, the pass-through to tradables has largely run its course, while the inertial price adjustment process in regulated utilities and other non-tradables continues. Seasonally- adjusted annualized month-on-month inflation in every of the last three months was within the target range for annual inflation  6-8%. Households' expectations of inflation have subsided as well, the NBK survey shows. Proportion of households expecting inflation to accelerate or to remain flat in the next 12 months has declined from 61.6% in January 2016 to 40.5% in April 2016. The risks to inflation stemming on demand side are assessed as insignificant. Consumer demand remains depressed due to a decline in real wages and budget policy adjustments. The level of economic activity in the commodity sector remains low due to weak external demand and uncertainties in the global financial and commodity markets. Supply of credit will remain constrained in the near-term. The forecast of annual inflation for 2016 remains within the band of 6-8%. The shift towards tenge in the currency preferences of depositors continues on the background of stabilization of exchange rate expectations and high yields. Purchases of US dollars bills by households have declined significantly. In February through March 2016, sales of foreign currency by households exceeded purchases, first time in 10 years. In March the volume of tenge deposits increased by 777.5 bln. tenge or 4.8% of total deposits. A gradual rise of tenge-denominated high interest rate liabilities elevate the risks to financial stability by raising interest expenses. Banks that offer fixed-rate variable-size deposits with duration that far exceeds money market's run the risk of locking up into high funding costs over the medium term. The dates are determined by the dates of publication of macroeconomic statistics as well as the time requirements for modeling and forecasting work within the NBK.

Romania,2016-05-05,"Video (Romanian only): Press briefing 5 May 2016. The NBR Board has also analysed and approved the new quarterly Inflation Report which will be released to the public on May 10, 2016. In line with expectations, the annual inflation rate went deeper into negative territory in the first quarter of this year to reach -3.0 percent in March against -0.93 percent in December 2015, as a result of the cut in the standard VAT rate to 20 percent, from 24 percent, starting 1 January 2016 and low global commodity prices. The average annual CPI inflation rate went down to -1.4 percent in March, while the average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is relevant for assessing convergence with the European Union, came in at -1.1 percent. Annual GDP growth gathered momentum in 2015 to hit a post-crisis high of 3.8 percent, driven by the significant advance in consumption and the strengthening uptrend in investment. The negative contribution from net exports increased, with the influence of swift growth of domestic absorption becoming visible especially in the latter part of 2015. The most recent data and business surveys point to an ongoing expansion of consumer demand, amid the fiscal stimuli and rising household income. At the same time, the industrial sector witnessed a decline in labour productivity, along with positive annual dynamics of wages. Real monetary conditions have retained their stimulative nature. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector saw its upward trend strengthening, fuelled by the fast-paced increase in leu-denominated loans. Loans in domestic currency came to hold 52.7 percent of the stock of private sector loans in March 2016, from 51.7 percent in the previous month (the highest reading since 2007), laying the groundwork for an improvement in the monetary policy transmission and the mitigation of risks to financial stability. In today's meeting, the NBR Board has examined and approved the May 2016 Inflation Report. The Report shows the new quarterly forecast, which envisages the annual inflation rate remaining in negative territory until July 2016, due to transitory effects of the cut in the VAT rate and other indirect taxes, as well as to the reduction in some administered prices (energy). The baseline scenario sees the inflation rate gradually returning inside the variation band of the target and standing in the upper half of the band at the end of the forecast horizon. Risks to the current projection stem from both domestic and external sources, against the background of heightened uncertainty. Specifically, the external environment is further affected by increased concerns over global economic growth, the renewed worsening of the situation in Greece, and the forthcoming referendum in the UK. To this adds the uncertainty related to the volatility of the international financial markets, geopolitical tensions, the diverging monetary policy stances of the world's major central banks, and the international oil price evolution. On the domestic front, risks stem from the fiscal and income policies, as well as from the adverse effects of legislative changes in the financial field. Based on currently available data and in the context of heightened uncertainty, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum and to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system. Moreover, the NBR Board has decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. These decisions aim to ensure price stability over the medium term, which helps achieve sustainable economic growth. The NBR Board reiterates that a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and structural reforms are pivotal to consolidating the Romanian economy and enhancing its resilience to adverse conditions worldwide. The NBR is closely monitoring domestic and external developments for an adequate use and dosage of all its available tools to fulfil the overriding objective regarding medium-term price stability and preserve financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 10 May 2016. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 30 June 2016."
Mongolia,2016-05-06,"THE BANK OF MONGOLIA MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Cutting the policy interest rate Number: 2016/02 Effective date: 06 May 2016 As its meeting on 05 May 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia decided to cut the policy interest rate by 1.5 percentage point to 10.5 percent. Annual inflation measured by CPI declined to 1.7% as of March 2016, has still been lower than the targeted level for the last consecutive 9 months. Both demand-driven and supply-shock inflationary pressures are expected to be at low level throughout this year; therefore it shall positively affect maintaining low and stable inflation. The overall balance of payments is projected to have no deficit at the end of 2016, supported by a positive outlook for foreign direct investments in the medium-term. Favorable changes and positive developments in macroeconomic external balance have further expanded monetary policy room towards continued easing. However, it has been a mandatory measure and inevitable adjustment to cut budget expenditures in conjunction with the underperformance of revenues, and nullify budget deficits in order to achieve key objectives of macroeconomic policy framework “The New Equilibrium”. This decision on cautious and monetary easing shall positively affect promoting monetary and credit growth, private sector investments and economic activities. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Poland,2016-05-06,"Warsaw, 6 May 2016 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 5-6 May 2016 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 1.50%;  lombard rate at 2.50%;  deposit rate at 0.50%;  rediscount rate 1.75%. Global economic activity growth remains moderate, amid continuing uncertainty about its outlook. In the euro area, economic recovery continues, although weak economic conditions in emerging economies have a negative impact on the activity in this economy. In the United States, economic growth slowed down in 2016 Q1, but this was accompanied by ongoing improvement in labour market conditions. In China. GDP growth continues to decelerate gradually, while Russia and Brazil remain in recession. Prices of oil and other commodities in the global markets  despite some increase in recent months  are still markedly lower than a year ago. Low commodity prices, combined with moderate global economic activity, are the main factor behind very low consumer price growth in many economies. In some economies  including the euro area  price growth is negative. The European Central Bank is keeping the interest rates at a very low level, including the deposit rate below zero, and continues financial asset purchases. At the same time, the Federal Reserve  after increasing the interest rates in December  is keeping the rates unchanged, while indicating a possible interest rate rise in the future. In Poland, the revised data on national accounts indicate that GDP growth in 2015 Q4 was higher than previously estimated. In 2016 Q1. GDP growth might have slowed down slightly. The rise in economic activity is still supported by growing employment, improving consumer sentiment, sound financial standing of enterprises, their high capacity utilization and stable lending growth. Hence, the weakening in GDP growth in early 2016 was probably temporary, although the continuing uncertainty about economic conditions abroad is a risk factor for domestic economic activity. With negative output gap and moderate growth of average nominal wages, currently there is no inflationary pressure in the economy. Annual consumer price growth and producer price growth stay negative. External factors  particularly the earlier sharp fall in global commodity prices and low price growth in the environment of the Polish economy  continue to be the main sources of deflation. This is accompanied by very low inflation expectations. The persisting deflation has not adversely affected decisions of economic agents so far. 1/2 In the Council's assessment, price growth will stay negative in the coming quarters due to the earlier substantial decline in global commodity prices. At the same time. GDP growth is expected to remain stable, following a temporary deceleration earlier this year. Consumer demand will continue to be the main driver of economic growth, supported by rising employment, forecasted acceleration of wage growth and an increase in social benefits. This notwithstanding, the downside risks to the global economic conditions and the volatility of commodity prices remain the sources of uncertainty for domestic economy and price developments. The Council maintains its assessment that  given the available data and forecasts  the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance."
Philippines,2016-05-11,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy rates at 4.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs and special deposit accounts (SDA) were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment of a continuing manageable inflation environment. Latest forecasts continue to indicate that average inflation is likely to settle within the target range of 3.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point for 2016-2017. The Monetary Board observed that inflation continues to be driven mainly by supply-side factors. Meanwhile, inflation expectations for 2016 have declined slightly due to low inflation readings in recent months but remain firmly within the inflation target band over the policy horizon. The Monetary Board also recognized that while global economic conditions have become weaker since the previous meeting, prospects for domestic economic activity nevertheless remain robust, supported by solid private household consumption and investment, buoyant business sentiment, and adequate credit and domestic liquidity. Higher fiscal spending is expected to further boost domestic demand. At the same time, the overall balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook remains tilted to the downside, with potential downward price pressures associated with slower-than-expected global economic activity and possible second-round effects from lower international oil prices. Nevertheless, upside risks to the inflation outlook could come from the impact of El Niño dry weather conditions on food prices and utility rates as well as pending petitions for power rate adjustments. Given these considerations, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions to ensure the consistency of the monetary policy stance with stable prices and sustainable economic growth."
Thailand,2016-05-11,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 11 May 2016 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 11 May 2016 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. Key considerations for policy deliberation are as follows. The Thai economy continued to recover gradually on the back of public expenditure and the tourism sector which expanded with the broad-based increase in the number of inbound tourists. Nevertheless merchandise export volume, excluding gold, contracted, while private investment remained low with expansion seen only in some business sectors. At the same time, private consumption slowed partly from the impact of the ongoing drought on income of agricultural households. As such, the balance of risks to economic growth was judged to be tilted more to the downside than previously assessed. Meanwhile the global economic recovery remained fragile. In addition, the baht, which strengthened against some trading partner currencies in some recent periods, might not be as conducive to the economic recovery as it could be. Going forward, monetary policy divergence among advanced economies will continue to be a major contributing factor to capital flow and exchange rate volatility. Headline inflation turned positive in April as the base effect of high oil prices dissipated, and fresh food prices accelerated from temporary factors. However demand- side inflationary pressure remained subdued as reflected by stable core inflation. The Committee assessed that headline inflation would gradually rise as the aforementioned base effect continued to wane, although the inflation outlook could be affected by uncertainties pertaining to global oil price movements and softened domestic demand. In deliberating monetary policy, the Committee judged that the Thai economy would continue to expand at a rate close to the previous assessment but face greater downside risks on the domestic front. Nonetheless current monetary conditions eased further as bond yields remained low, and commercial bank lending rates declined. Therefore the policy rate should be kept on hold to preserve policy space, while risks to financial stability from search-for-yield behavior continued to warrant close monitoring. The Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain sufficiently accommodative, and stands ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to ensure that monetary conditions are conducive to the economic recovery, while ensuring financial stability."
South Korea,2016-05-13,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has shown indications of slowing, but that the modest improvements in the euro area have continued. The economic slowdown in China has shown signs of easing a bit, but economic growth in other emerging market economies has continued to slow, centering around natural resource-exporting countries. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, centering around advanced economies such as the US, but judges that it will be affected by factors including financial and economic conditions in emerging market countries, international oil price movements, and global financial market volatility. Looking at the Korean economy, exports have remained on their trend of decline, and domestic demand activities such as consumption, and the sentiments of economic agents have continued their modest improvements. On the employment front, while the pace of increase in the number of persons employed slowed somewhat in April, the employment-to-population ratio and the unemployment rate maintained the same levels as in April of last year. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will continue its trend of modest improvement going forward, centering around domestic demand activities, but in view of external economic conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to still be high. Despite expansions in the extents of increase in prices of industrial products other than petroleum, consumer price inflation registered 1.0% in April, the same as in March, in line mainly with a slowdown in the rate of service fee increase. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices rose slightly to 1.8%, from 1.7% in March. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will continue at a low level, under the influence of the low oil prices for example. In the housing market, sales prices maintained their level of the previous month while leasehold deposit prices showed low rates of increase. In the domestic financial markets, stock prices and long-term market interest rates have fallen since April after having previously risen, affected mainly by changes in investor preferences for safe assets. After having appreciated against the US dollar, the Korean won has depreciated against it again. The won has meanwhile depreciated considerably against the Japanese yen, in line with the yen's strengthening. Bank household lending has sustained a trend of increase at a level exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, while working to support the recovery of economic growth the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon, and also pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor any changes in monetary policies or in financial and economic conditions in major countries, the progress of corporate restructuring, the trend of increase in household debt, and the movements of capital flows."
Peru,2016-05-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2016 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.25 percent. The Board has taken this decision considering that: The rise in the prices of some food products and utilities has been reversing and the depreciation of the sol against the dollar has slowed down; Inflation expectations have continued reversing gradually; Local economic activity has been recovering, and The global economy continues showing mixed signals of recovery in terms of production and employment as well as lower volatility in financial markets. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to evaluate the convenience of making additional adjustments in the monetary policy rate. Inflation is expected to return to be within the target range in a period of time similar to the monetary policy horizon. Inflation in April showed a rate of 0.01 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation fell from 4.3 percent in March to 3.9 percent in April. The lower monthly rate of inflation is explained by a partial reversal of food prices and by the lower exchange rate of the dollar against the sol. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.03 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation fell from 3.6 percent in March to 3.2 percent in April. The inflation rate expected for 2016 is 3.4 percent, while the rate expected for 2017 is 2.9 percent and the estimated rate for 2018 is 2.6 percent. Recent indicators of economic activity and business expectations show similar GDP growth rates to those of the potential output levels. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for June at the Board meeting that will be held on June 9, 2016."
Armenia,2016-05-17,"PRESS RELEASE 17.05.2016 At the May 17, 2016 meeting the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage point to 7.75%. In April of 2016 deflation was 0.3% compared to 0.4% recorded in the same month of the previous year. At the end of the month the 12-month inflation rate amounted to -1.9%. Global economy continues growing at slow rates yet relative stability came to replace deflationary patterns in international commodity markets. However, the Board of the CBA estimates that the external sector will continue transmitting deflationary impact on domestic prices in the upcoming months, which is expected to phase out in the second half of this year. The Board of the CBA notes that in January-March, relative to the same reference period last year, the economic activity has increased considerably. This was mainly due to the industry and services sectors where developments were more positive than anticipated. Positive developments are also observed in the domestic demand, reflecting the effect of expansionary policies carried out by the CBA and Government of Armenia in previous months. In the meantime, the tradable sector of the economy has expanded and posted high growth rates. In view of the above-mentioned developments, the CBA's expectations of economic growth for 2016 were adjusted upside. At the same time, the Board of the CBA admits that inflation expectations have declined as a result of consistent monetary policy of the CBA. On top of the policy influence a reduction in the natural gas tariff as an additional factor is now expected, based on which the Board finds it reasonable to easing the monetary conditions in a greater stride. Such a policy will prompt gradual expanding of the inflation environment since the second half of 2016 while the 12-month inflation rate will return to the target in the forecast horizon. The Board of the CBA will look to further easing of monetary conditions, as expected economic developments unfold and no additional risks emerge in external and domestic sectors. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program. Q2, 2016) to be published on May 27, 2016.

Chile,2016-05-17,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 17 May 2016 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3.5%. International financial markets are on a similar path to that of previous months. In spite of this, risks remain. Lately, while differing in magnitude, currencies have tended to depreciate with respect to the dollar. Forecasts for world growth do not show significant changes, although forecasts for the United States have been revised downward. Comodity prices rose from last month, with some exceptions, including copper. On the domestic front, in April CPI inflation was 4.2% annually. Projections suggest that it will remain above 4% for some months. Inflation expectations two years out remain at 3%. The evolution of these variables will continue to be monitored with special attention. In the first quarter, economic activity outperformed estimates in the March Monetary Policy Report; however, confidence indicators are still in pessimistic territory and the labor market experienced a sharper deterioration. The pace of annual wage growth showed no variation. The Board estimates that, to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target, monetary policy will need to continue to normalize, at a pace that will depend on incoming information and its implications on inflation projections. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Malaysia,2016-05-19,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. Global economic expansion continues, albeit at a more moderate pace, across major advanced and emerging market economies in the first quarter of the year. In Asia, domestic demand remains the key contributor to growth amid continued weakness in the external sector. Volatility in the international financial markets has receded and investor sentiments have improved, although this is susceptible to policy and market developments. Looking ahead, structural issues and geopolitical developments will continue to constrain growth of the global economy despite the highly accommodative monetary conditions. For Malaysia, growth moderated slightly in the first quarter of the year, in line with earlier expectations. Going forward, economic activity is expected to improve with domestic demand remaining the key driver of growth. Private consumption is expected to expand further, supported by continued growth in wages and employment, and the additional disposable income from measures announced during the 2016 Budget Recalibration. While the growth of private investment has moderated due to lower investment by the oil and gas industry and commodities sector, overall investment activity will remain supported by the implementation of infrastructure projects and capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors. The external sector will continue to be constrained by weak external environment. The prospects are therefore for the economy to expand by 4-4.5% in 2016. Inflation averaged 3.4% in the first quarter of 2016, and is expected to trend lower for the rest of the year due to the low energy and commodity prices and the generally subdued global inflation. Overall domestic financial conditions have remained stable. The financial system continues to be sound, with improved liquidity in the domestic financial system, continued orderly functioning of the financial and foreign exchange markets, and financial institutions operating with strong capital and liquidity buffers. The growth of financing to the private sector is consistent with the pace of economic activity and financing conditions remain supportive of economic growth. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy is accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC recognises that there are downside risks in the global economic and financial environment and is closely monitoring and assessing their implications on domestic price stability and growth. This is to ensure that the monetary policy stance is consistent with sustainable growth of the Malaysian economy. The MPC also decided for future Monetary Policy Statements to be released at 3:00 p.m. on the second day of the MPC meeting. Bank Negara Malaysia 19 May 2016."
South Africa,2016-05-19,"South African Reserve Bank Press Statement Embargo Delivery 19 May 2016 Statement of the Monetary Policy Committee Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank South Africa's inflation and growth dynamics continue to highlight the policy dilemma facing monetary policy. Although headline CPI inflation has moderated since February, the respite is expected to be temporary, as food and petrol price pressures continue to intensify. The recovery in the rand exchange rate in April also proved to be short-lived, as both domestic and external factors weighed on the currency. At the same time, domestic economic growth continues to disappoint. While there are signs that the economy may be reaching the low point in the growth cycle, the recovery is expected to be slow with downside risks. Global economic growth and financial market conditions have stabilised somewhat since the previous MPC meeting, but a high degree of risk and uncertainty persists. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas has moderated after reaching a recent high of 7,0 per cent in February. In March and April. CPI inflation measured 6,3 per cent and 6,2 per cent. Food price pressures continued unabated, with food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation accelerating to 11,0 per cent in April, up from 9,5 per cent previously. Goods price inflation moderated from 6,9 per cent to 6,7 per cent, while services price inflation 1. Goods price inflation moderated from 6,9 per cent to 6,7 per cent, while services price inflation 1 was unchanged at 5,7 per cent. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity measured 5,5 per cent, up from 5,4 per cent in March. While the impact of the weaker exchange rate remains relatively low, there are indications of increased pass-through in some categories, particularly new motor vehicles and appliances. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods moderated significantly from 8,1 per cent in February to 7,1 per cent in March, mainly as a result of a sharp fall in fuel prices. Manufactured food product price inflation accelerated to 10,5 per cent, with the category of food, beverages and tobacco products contributing 3,1 percentage points to the March outcome. Agricultural prices increased by 23,1 per cent in March, with cereal and other crop prices increasing by 50,0 per cent year-on- year. The latest inflation forecast of the Bank shows a moderate near-term deterioration compared with the previous forecast, but there is some improvement in the medium- term outlook. The breach of the upper end of the target range, while still protracted, is now slightly shorter, with inflation expected to fall within the range during the third quarter of 2017. Inflation is now expected to average 6,7 per cent in 2016 compared with 6,6 per cent previously. In 2017 and 2018 inflation is expected to average 6,2 per cent and 5,4 per cent, marginally down from the previous forecast. The expected peak, at 7,3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016, is unchanged. The downward revisions are due in part to the higher interest rate assumption, a slightly less depreciated exchange rate assumption, a wider output gap and a lower electricity price assumption. These pressures are counteracted to some extent by a higher 2. These pressures are counteracted to some extent by a higher 2 near-term food price forecast, and the impact of upward revisions to the international oil price assumptions. The forecast for core inflation is slightly improved, with a lower forecast for 2016 of 5,9 per cent from 6,2 per cent previously. Forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are unchanged at 5,7 per cent and 5,2 per cent. Core inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range in the third quarter of 2016 for four consecutive quarters, with a peak of 6,2 per cent (previously 6,5 per cent) in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. The BER survey of inflation expectations is only due for release in July. The median expectations of economic analysts, as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in May are more or less unchanged compared with the previous survey, and are slightly higher than those of the Bank for 2016 and 2017. In the latest survey, the median expectations for 2016 and 2017 were 6,7 per cent and 6,4 per cent, with inflation expected to be within the target range in 2018, at an average of 5,7 per cent. Bond market expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates are more or less unchanged since the previous meeting and remain at fairly elevated levels. Global growth remains hesitant following a disappointing first quarter in the US and the UK in particular. While labour market conditions in the US have improved, low corporate profits have constrained investment. However, consensus forecasts show that a moderate improvement is expected in the coming months, but at a lower rate than previously expected. The outlook for the UK is clouded by the possibility of an exit from the EU, while the prospects for the Japanese economy remain uncertain. By contrast, the growth outlook in the euro area is more promising, driven by 3. By contrast, the growth outlook in the euro area is more promising, driven by 3 improvements in Germany and France in particular, although there are concerns that the recent momentum may be fading. Divergent prospects are evident in the emerging markets. Russia and Brazil remain in recession, but there are signs of some stabilisation in China, as the economy appears to be responding to government policy initiatives. This improvement, along with a weaker US dollar, has resulted in some recovery in commodity prices, as well as a pick-up in portfolio flows to emerging markets. Of some concern is the persistent deterioration in growth forecasts for sub-Saharan Africa, which includes some of South Africa's important trading partners. The region is now expected to underperform the global economy in 2016, for the first time in 16 years, as the effects of lower commodity prices and drought take their toll. Global inflation pressures remain benign, with low energy prices still having an impact, although this effect is likely to dissipate with the recent upward trend in oil prices. The latest data show declining prices in the euro area and Japan, and low inflation in the US and the UK. Inflation has remained relatively higher in a number of Latin American economies, particularly those experiencing currency depreciation. As a result of these trends, asynchronous monetary policies persist. While policies are generally accommodative amid subdued growth, particularly in many advanced economies, a number of emerging markets have maintained a tightening bias in response to inflation pressures. The US Fed is expected to continue with its slow pace of policy rate normalisation but there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of the next increase. The rand exchange rate has remained volatile, and following a few weeks of relative strength, has resumed a weakening path and continues to pose an upside risk to the 4. The rand exchange rate has remained volatile, and following a few weeks of relative strength, has resumed a weakening path and continues to pose an upside risk to the 4 inflation outlook. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has traded in a range between R14,20 and R15,90 against the US dollar, and has depreciated by 1,5 per cent against the dollar, by 0,9 per cent against the euro, and by 1,2 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. During this period the rand was initially favourably impacted by improved commodity prices, the narrower trade balance, and expectations of a slower pace of US Fed monetary policy tightening. However, these gains were reversed as global growth concerns resurfaced in early May, and other domestic factors, including the low growth outlook, concerns about a possible ratings downgrade and more recently heightened political uncertainty impacted adversely on the currency. Although the capital flow environment for emerging markets has improved recently, this has not applied to equity flows. South Africa's experience has mirrored this, but with stronger equity outflows. According to the JSE, since the beginning of the year, net sales of domestic equities by non-residents have amounted to R56 bn. By contrast, non-residents have been net purchasers of domestic government bonds (year-to-date R23 bn), although the past two weeks has seen net sales. The domestic economic growth outlook remains weak, with the Bank's GDP growth forecast for 2016 revised down from 0,8 per cent to 0,6 per cent. While a recovery is still expected in the next two years, the forecasts for both these years have been revised down by 0,1 percentage point to 1,3 per cent and 1,7 per cent. With the estimates of potential output unchanged, the output gap is expected to widen over the forecast period. The Bank's leading indicator of economic activity continued its downward trajectory in February, consistent with the constrained outlook. 5 Recent high-frequency data paint a particularly bleak picture of the first quarter of this year, following a sharp contraction in mining output, minimal growth in the manufacturing sector, and declines in electricity production and consumption. While the Bank's forecast for GDP growth in the quarter is barely positive, it does represent the low point of the forecast, and a slow upward trend is expected going forward. This view is consistent with the favourable developments in the Barclays PMI which has recovered fairly strongly, to above the neutral 50-level for the past two months. The real value of building plans passed, particularly non-residential, increased markedly on a 3-month-to-3-month basis, indicative perhaps of some life in the construction sector, despite very low levels of business confidence in the sector. However, while the recent modest recovery in commodity prices may impact positively on mining output, prices remain low and the sector remains beset by higher input costs and regulatory uncertainty. The continuing drought is also expected to put further strain on the agricultural sector. The economic slowdown is also reflected in labour market trends, with the unemployment rate rising to 26,7 per cent in the first quarter of 2016, from 26,4 per cent a year earlier. Although employment growth was positive over the year to the first quarter, the year-on-year growth rate moderated significantly, with employment losses recorded in a number of sectors including manufacturing, agriculture and transport. Household consumption expenditure also remains subdued, with low growth in retail sales in the first quarter. While there was a welcome increase in exports, new vehicle sales also continue to decline. The FNB/BER consumer confidence index recovered 6. The FNB/BER consumer confidence index recovered 6 to some extent in the first quarter of the year, although it still remains at depressed levels, and indicates a low willingness to spend and utilise credit among consumers. The constrained outlook for household consumption expenditure is indicative of the absence of demand pressures in the economy. This is also confirmed in the weak wealth effects and the continued slow pace of credit extension to households. Although some improvement has been seen in this regard, growth remains negative in real terms, and is mainly related to mortgage advances and general loans, particularly unsecured lending. Growth in credit extension to corporates remains strong, but moderated in March. Wage growth appears to be moderating, with growth in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sector declining to below 6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015, mainly due to lower private sector remuneration growth. Once adjusting for labour productivity, growth in unit labour costs remained unchanged at 5,0 per cent in that quarter. Food prices remain a significant risk to the inflation outlook in the face of persistent drought and exchange rate weakness. These pressures are evident in both the consumer price and producer price indices. Although for some time the MPC had been expecting an acceleration in food price inflation, the recent increases have surprised on the upside, and more aggressive food price increases are now forecast for the near term. The Bank now expects food price inflation to peak at around 12 per cent in the final quarter of this year. However, should food prices stabilise or decline later in the year, there is the potential for downside base effects next year. Futures prices suggest that both maize and wheat prices are expected to remain 7. Futures prices suggest that both maize and wheat prices are expected to remain 7 elevated for the rest of the year, reinforced by a sizeable increase in the domestic wheat import tariff. The international oil price assumptions in the forecasting model have been increased, with the price of Brent crude oil remaining firmly above the US$40 per barrel level since the second week of April. Demand has surprised on the upside, and, despite an increase in supply from Iran, output has declined in a number of countries. This upward price trend may, however, be contained by high levels of inventories. Domestic petrol prices have increased by a cumulative R1,00 per litre since March, mainly due to higher international prices and an increase in the fuel levy. Should current exchange rate and international oil price trends persist, a further significant increase can be expected in June. The MPC faced the continuing dilemma of upside risks to the inflation forecast and a worsening growth outlook. The risks to the growth outlook are assessed to be on the downside, particularly in the short term, despite the downward revision to the forecast. Both the mining and agricultural sectors are expected to weigh heavily on the first quarter growth outcome, and the outlook is therefore dependent in part on whether these sectors rebound in the coming quarters. The Committee remains concerned about the inflation outlook and the extended breach of the target. Although the inflation forecast has shown a moderate improvement over the medium term, the risks are still assessed to be on the upside. The exchange rate remains highly sensitive to domestic political developments and risks of an earlier-than-expected tightening in US monetary policy. The exchange rate implicit in the forecast is stronger than the current level, imparting a significant degree of upside risk. While pass-through from the exchange rate to inflation 8. While pass-through from the exchange rate to inflation 8 remains relatively subdued, there are indications that this may be increasing. There is also some upside risk to the international oil price assumption. The Committee remains concerned that inflation expectations remain at uncomfortably high levels. Although core inflation has remained relatively contained in recent months, with a lower peak now expected, it is forecast to accelerate and exceed the upper end of the inflation target range for four quarters in response to exchange rate and wage pressures. Some countervailing risks are also evident. While there is a risk that food prices may accelerate faster in the near term, the longer term forecast assumes that food prices will stabilise by year end, allowing for favourable base effects next year. However, should food prices, particularly grains, decline in response to a normalisation of weather patterns, a much sharper downward food inflation trajectory could transpire. The absence of demand pressures, and risks to consumption expenditure growth may also contribute to downside risks. The increase in the repo rate at the previous MPC meeting contributed to the improvement in the longer-term inflation forecast, and that move should be seen in conjunction with previous actions in the cycle and the lagged effects of monetary policy. The MPC felt that there is some room to pause in this tightening cycle and accordingly decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged for now at 7,0 per cent per annum. Five members preferred no change, while one member preferred a 25 basis point increase. The MPC remains focused on its inflation mandate, but sensitive to the extent possible to the state of the economy. The MPC will not hesitate to act appropriately 9. The MPC will not hesitate to act appropriately 9 should the inflation dynamics require a response, within a flexible inflation targeting framework. Future moves, as before, will continue to be highly data dependent. Lesetja Kganyago Governor Contact person: Candice Jeffreys +27 12 313 4209 Candice."
Pakistan,2016-05-21,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement May 21, 2016 Towards the end of FY16, macroeconomic conditions continue to improve. Headline CPI inflation, despite its continuous increase on Year-on-Year (YoY) basis, would remain below its FY16 annual average target of percent. Real GDP growth is set to exceed its FY15 outcome of. percent, while remaining below its target of. percent. Current account deficit is likely to shrink to the previous year's level of around percent of GDP and the expected surplus in balance of payments would be marginally less than the FY15 level. Foreign exchange reserves are still projected to maintain upward trajectory. As expected, headline CPI inflation sustained its rising trend for the seventh consecutive month and on YoY basis rose to. percent in April 2016 from the low of. percent in September 2015. In addition to the seasonal impact of perishable food items and services, this increase owes to further waning of the base effect and second round impact of decline in oil prices. Similarly core inflation measures have broadly followed rising trend in this fiscal year indicating buildup of underlying inflationary tendencies. Despite these trends and developments, the inflation outlook for FY16 is low. However going into FY17 inflation is likely to attain higher plateau. Major sources that would determine this path are as follows. First relatively faster pickup in demand compared to its gradually improving supply dynamics could lead inflation on higher side. Second rising global oil price along with modest recovery in non-energy commodity prices will pass on to the domestic consumer prices. Third some risks, such as imposition of new taxation measures and increase in electricity and gas tariffs, if realized would put upward pressure on CPI inflation. Expansion in industrial activities and services sector would salvage some of the lost momentum to GDP growth due to the losses from cotton and rice crops. Recovery in Large-scale Manufacturing, which grew by. percent during Jul-Mar FY16 compared to. percent in Jul-Mar FY15, is expected to continue further on account of improving energy and security conditions. At the same time, buoyant growth in construction and improved demand for consumer durables has persistently indicated revival in domestic demand in the current fiscal year. This is also reflected in uptake in credit to private sector which increased by Rs314. billion during Jul-Mar FY16 compared to Rs206. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN billion during the same period of FY15. Thus GDP growth in FY16 is expected to provide the needed sustainability in growth trajectory and the basis for further improvement in FY17. On the external front, stability in the balance of payments and upward trajectory in foreign exchange reserves mainly owes to combination of favorable developments both in the current and financial accounts. Steady workers' remittances and low oil prices have helped contain the current account deficits at manageable levels, while multilateral and bilateral inflows have largely contributed to the surpluses in the financial account. In the current fiscal year as well, favorable trends in these factors are expected to yield an overall surplus in the balance of payments with SBP's foreign exchange reserves estimated to increase to over months of import coverage; up from around months at end-FY15. Going forward, foreign direct investment is projected to increase as the work on projects under China Pakistan Economic Corridor gains momentum. On the other hand, owing to some anticipated uptick in commodity prices along with improvements in domestic energy supplies exports receipts are likely to recover marginally. However with weaknesses in private capital inflows persisting for some time now, uncertainty may arise if there is an adverse change in oil price or workers' remittances. Monetary Policy Committee, after detailed deliberations, has decided to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points from. percent to.75 percent. Page."
Israel,2016-05-23,"Background conditions. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor April increased by 0.4 percent, a slightly smaller increase than forecasters' prediction for an increase of 0.5 percent, on average. There was a seasonal increase of 3.7 percent in the clothing and footwear component, and a seasonal decline of 0.8 percent in the furniture and household equipment component. The transport and communication component increased, by 1.5 percent, impacted by an increase in fuel prices and a seasonal increase in the price of travel abroad. In contrast, the food component declined by 0.3 percent, a moderate rate given the government measures to cancel customs duties on food products. Net of seasonal effects, the CPI declined by 0.2 percent. The inflation rate as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was -0.9 percent, compared with -0.7 percent in the 12 months ending in March. Excluding the direct effect of energy prices and administrative price reductions, inflation over the past 12 months was 0.4 percent. Prices of components representing tradable goods in the CPI declined by 3.6 percent over the past 12 months, and the prices of components representing nontradable items increased by 0.6 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: There was a mixed trend in one-year inflation expectations from the various sources this month: Inflation expectations derived from the capital marketsincreased to 0.3 percent (compared with 0.1 percent last month); inflationexpectations derived from the banks' internal interest rates increased to 0.25 percent (compared with 0.1 percent last month); and private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings are for an increase of 0.7 percent, on average, (compared with 0.8 percent last month). Medium-term forward expectations declined, while long-term expectations remained stable: Expectations for the second year declined by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.7 percent, third-year forward expectations declined by 0.1 percentage points, to 1.2 percent, and 3-5 year forward expectations declined by 0.15 percentage points, to 1.3 percent. Long-term (5 C2 AD-10 years) expectations remained around the midpoint of the target range,at 2.2 percent. The makam curve and the Telbor curve remained unchanged, and do not indicate any change expected in the interest rate in the next year. According to the average of projections by private forecasters, the Bank of Israel interest rate is expected to remain at its current level in the coming months. Real economic activity: The first estimate of National Accounts data for the first quarter indicates a slowdown in the growth rate. GDP grew by 0.8 percent (seasonally adjusted National Accounts data, in annual terms), and business sector product contracted by 0.4 percent. Exports (excluding diamonds and startups) contracted sharply by 12.9 percent, reflecting weakness in both goods exports and services exports.Private consumption, which grew by 4 percent, continues to lead economic growth, with an emphasis on current consumption. Public consumption increased by 2.5 percent, and investment in the principal industries, excluding ships and aircraft, increased by 8.1 percent, although this is mainly a resultof investment in construction and in transport vehicles, as investment in machinery and equipment declined by 3.4 percent. Foreign trade data (in current dollar terms. January-April compared to the preceding four months) indicate a decline in the three main manufacturing export industries: chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and electronic components: of about 15 percent, compared with an increase of 1 percent in other industries. Services exports have not grown for a year and a half. The moderate increase of the past few months in goods imports continues, mainly in consumer goods and investment assets. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics declined in April, but is still at a high level. The index compiled by Bank Hapoalim improved in April, and its level is similar to the level of the past year. The Purchasing Managers Index increased to 50.5 points in April. The labormarket: The picture conveyed by the labor market continues to be positive. The Labor Force Survey for April indicated, for the prime working ages (25-64), a slight decline in the unemployment rate (4.4 percent compared with 4.5 percent in March) and increases in the employment rate (76.9 percent compared with 76.3 percent) and the participation rate (80.5 percent compared with 79.8 percent). The positive portrayal is also reflected in an accelerated increase in nominal wages across all industries. Real wages increased by 0.6 percent (seasonally adjusted) in December-February, compared with the three preceding months, while nominal wages increased by 0.5 percent. The number of employee posts remains elevated, though it has remained virtually unchanged since October 2015. Health tax receipts for February-April were 5.3 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period in the year before, reflecting the increase in employment and wages. Budget data: The cumulative domestic surplus (excluding net credit) in government activity was NIS 0.2 billion in January-April, compared with a surplus of approximately NIS 2.9 billion in the corresponding period of 2015, and it is about NIS 1.7 billion higher than the seasonal path consistent with achieving the deficit target for 2016. The deviation reflects revenues that are NIS 1.9 billion lower thanthe path, as well as expenditures that are NIS 3.6 billion lower than the path, primarily in the interest payment. National Insurance fund and creditsubsidy items. Tax revenues in April totaled NIS 21.3 billion, which is NIS 0.7 billion lower than the seasonal path consistent with the estimate of tax revenue. Tax revenues in January-April were about 3.7 percent higher in real terms than in the corresponding period of the previous year (an increase of 5.5 percent based on an estimate that nets out the effects of extraordinary activities and legislative changes). Gross domestic VAT revenue increased by about 4.6 percent in real terms in April, compared with the same month last year, and by about 11.3 percent net of the effect of legislative changes. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on April 20, 2016, through May 20, 2016, the shekel weakened by 3 percent against the dollar and by 1.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the preceding 12 months, the shekel appreciated by 3.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on April 20, 2016, throughMay 19, 2016, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 6.7 percent, mainly due to weakness in the pharmaceuticals industry. Government bond yield curves flattened slightly, primarily for indexed bonds. The makam curve traded at a yield ranging around the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel'ssovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, did not change materially, and remains at about 75 basis points. The money supply: In the 12 months ending in April, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 25.4 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexeddeposits of up to one year) increased by 11.3 percent. The credit market: In April, the business sector (excluding banks and insurance companies) issued bonds totaling NIS 5.1 billion, after issuances of just NIS 1.8 billion in March. Average monthly issuance in the past year is about NIS 2.4 billion. Mutual fund withdrawals have been declining since the beginning of the year, and withdrawalsin April totaled NIS 0.9 billion. Funds specializing in corporate bonds and in equities in Israel even switched to net new investment in recent months. Corporate bond spreads continued to decline in most industries and were about 3.8 percentage points, on average, at the beginning of May. In April,the total volume of new mortgages taken out was NIS 4.7 billion, and the flow of mortgages extended over the past 12 months remains high, at about NIS 65 billion. The proportion of mortgages issued for the purchase of investment homes has been declining, and was 14.3 percent in March. Further to the trend of the past year, the interest rate on new mortgages increased in April in most tracks. There were increases of 0.05-0.13 percentage points in the variable-rate unindexed track, the fixed-rate CPI-indexed track, and the fixed-rate unindexed track, while there was a decline of 0.09 percentage points in the variable-rate. CPI-indexed track. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.2 percent in April, after increasing by 0.4 percent in March. The rate of home price increases moderated slightly in recent months, but remains high. Home prices increased by 0.4 percent in February-March, and by 6.9 percent in the 12 months ending in March, compared with 7.2 percent in the 12 months ending in previous month. Activity in the market remains vigorous. There were 8,200 transactions carried out in March, similar to the average in the four preceding months, and the composition of purchasers remained virtually unchanged, as first-time homebuyers and those upgrading their homes accounted for 82 percent of transactions. The volume of new home sales in March was 2,700 units higher than the average of the preceding four months (2,400 units). The stock of new homes available for sale remained unchanged in March, at approximately 26,700 homes, with the previous month's data revised significantly downward. The global economy: Data obtained this month continue to indicate weakness in the global economy. The weakness is focused in emerging economies, but first quarter data indicated a loss of momentum in the US and the UK as well. The slowdown in the growth rate of world trade also continues. Despite the weakness and low inflation, no additional accommodative measures were adopted by the major central banks. In the US. GDP grew by just 0.5 percent in the first quarter, and personal consumption continues to lead growth. The number of new jobs in the US, about 170,000 in April, was disappointing, but unemployment remains low and the increase in wages continues. Leading indicators point to continued weakness in manufacturing compared with positive momentum in services. The minutes of the FOMC meeting in April show that the committee members are not ruling out the possibility that economic conditions will make a federal funds rate increase necessary at their meeting in June, which led to an increase in the probability the markets attribute to such an increase. In Europe, growth wasat a relatively high quarterly rate of 0.5 percent, and data on expectations remained positive. However, industrial production and retail sales figures for March indicate more moderate growth during the year, while the annual inflation rate again turned negative, at -0.2 percent. Political developments remain a significant risk to continued growth in Europe, and the British economy is being negatively impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the results of the expected referendum on leaving the EU. In Japan, there was quarterly growth of 0.4 percent, but indicators of economic activity continue to indicate weakness, and the central bank again lowered its inflation forecast. In China, indicators of economic activity pointed to growth similarto the rate of previous months, with a significant increase in the volume of credit. Economic weakness continued in Russia and Brazil, while India's economy is notably good among emerging economies. Commodity prices remained volatile during the month, and the price of oil was $49 per barrelat the end of the month (compared with $43 the previous month). The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for June 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The intensifying decline in exports in recent months reinforces the Monetary Committee's assessment that in view of developments in the inflation environment, in growth in Israeland in the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. C 2B 7 The inflation environment remains low, with diverse developments this month: the CPI for April increased, but by a lower rate than expected; expectations for various terms moved in different directions, though medium-term and long-term expectations continue to be anchored within the target range. C 2B 7 The first estimate of National Accounts data indicates a worrying contraction in exports, after a prolonged virtual standstill, while private consumption, supported by the low interest rate and wage increases in the economy, continues to drive growth. In contrast, the picture conveyed by labor market datacontinues to be positive, and is reflected in a low level of unemployment,a high level of employment, wage increases, and a high job vacancy rate. C 2B 7 In global economic activity, weakness remains focused on emerging markets, and in the first quarter on the US and UK as well. The slowdown in the growth of world trade continues. The recovery in Europe remainsfragile. Major central banks continued monetary accommodation, but did notenhance it, and the markets' expected timing of an increase in theUS federal funds rate was brought forward, after having been deferred in previous months. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on March 27, 2016, through April 19, 2016, the shekel weakened by 3 percent against the US dollar and by 1.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the past 12 months there has been an appreciation of 3.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and the exchange rate level continues to weigh on growth of exports and the tradable sector. C 2B 7 The rate ofincrease in home prices moderated slightly in recent months but remains high. The volume of new mortgages taken out also remains elevated, despite anincrease in mortgage interest rates in recent months. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to achieving the inflation target remain high, and that the risks to growth have increased. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for June 2016 will be published on June 6, 2016. The decision regarding the interest rate for July 2016 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. June 27, 2016."
Nigeria,2016-05-24,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No 107 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of Monday and Tuesday 23rd and 24th May 2016 The Monetary Policy Committee met on 23rd and 24th May 2016 against a backdrop of challenging global and domestic economic and financial conditions. The Committee assessed the global and domestic macroeconomic and financial developments, the short-to medium-term prospects for the domestic economy and the outlook for the rest of the year. In attendance were 9 out of the 12 members. International Economic Developments The Committee noted with concern, the tapered growth and continued decline in global output since 2014. At an estimated 32 per cent, global output in 2016 was only 01 percentage point below the 31 per cent in the corresponding period of 2015. The sluggish global output was traced to weak fundamentals in both the advanced economies and Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), including increased volatility in global financial markets, sustained softness in commodity prices, sluggish global trade, resulting in persistent fragility, particularly in the EMDEs. The United States (US) economy slowed to 05 per cent in Q1 2016, a steep decline compared with the 14 per cent growth recorded in the last 1 quarter of 2015. The deceleration in US growth was attributed to contraction in non-residential fixed investment and energy businesses, a strong dollar which harmed exports, slowdown in government spending and moderation in private consumption expenditure (PCE). Japan which is currently in deflation is projected to grow by 05 per cent in 2016, the same as in 2015, on the back of persistently weak aggregate demand. The Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monthly asset purchase of ¥67 trillion (US$6173 billion) resulted in the Bank holding about one-third of outstanding government bonds, while the economy remained largely intractable with a credit crunch, indicating that the programmme may have lost its steam. In response to the contraction in credit. BoJ since January 2016, adopted a negative interest rate policy. Real GDP growth in the Euro area at 06 per cent in Q1, 2016 was a phenomenal improvement compared with the 03 per cent achieved in Q4 2015. The European Central Bank (ECB), at its meeting of 21st April, 2016 maintained the soft policy stance by holding its refinancing rate at 00 per cent, lending rate at 025 per cent and deposit rate at -04 per cent. The Bank also maintained its monthly asset purchase program of €80 billion (US$872 billion), hoping to further stimulate output growth and achieve its 2 per cent inflation target. The Bank of England (BoE) also retained its monthly assets purchase programme, financed through the issuance of reserves at ₤375 billion (US$54375 billion). At the end of its April 13, 2016 meeting. BoE retained 2 its policy rate at 05 per cent, with a commitment to raise inflation to its 20 per cent long run path. Weaknesses in major EMDEs, including low capital inflows, rising costs of funds and continuing geopolitical factors, have been identified as key constraints to growth. Adverse commodity prices continued to provide strong headwinds against growth, defining other economic and financial conditions in the EMDEs. Consequently, the IMF (WEO April 2016 Update) downgraded the 2016 growth forecast for this group of countries from 43 to 41 per cent. Disruptions to oil supply in Canada. Nigeria and Kuwait and, demand spikes following expectations of a US interest rate hike and buildup of crude oil inventories, contributed to mild oil price recovery in April 2016. Inflation remains largely suppressed in the advanced countries but tepid consumption spending and vulnerabilities in the financial markets continue to hamper financial intermediation and growth. Consequently the monetary policy stance in most advanced economies remained largely accommodative and most likely to be maintained throughout 2016. On the contrary, monetary policy in the EMDEs could continue to diverge substantially, reflecting the diversity of shocks confronting them. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output In the first quarter of 2016, the economy suffered from severe shocks related to energy shortages and price hikes, scarcity of foreign exchange and depressed consumer demand, among others. Consequently economic agents could not undertake new investments or procure needed raw materials. Shortage of foreign exchange arising from low crude oil prices manifested in low replacement levels for raw materials, other inputs as well as new investments. In addition, the energy crisis experienced in the first five months of the year, resulted in increased power outages and higher electricity tariffs, as well as fuel shortages; which led to factory closures in some cases. The prolonged budget impasse denied the economy the timely intervention of complementary fiscal policy to stimulate economic activity in the face of dwindling foreign capital inflows. Aggregate credit to the private sector remained highly tapered while credit to government grew beyond the programmed benchmark for the period. The Committee, however, noted that many of the prevailing conditions in the economy during the review period were outside the direct control of monetary policy, but hopes that the implementation of the 2016 Federal Budget, supported by relevant sectoral policies and easing supply shocks in energy and critical inputs, would provide the needed boost to the economy. Against this backdrop, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) for May 2016, indicated that domestic output in Q1, 2016 contracted by 036 per cent, the first negative growth in many years. This represents a drop of 247 percentage points in output from the 211 per cent reported in the last 4 quarter of 2015, and 432 percentage point lower than the 396 per cent recorded in the corresponding period of 2015. Aggregate output contracted in almost all sectors of the economy, with the non-oil sector declining by about 018 per cent in Q1 2016, compared with 314 per cent expansion in the preceding quarter. Only agriculture and trade grew by 068 per cent and 040 per cent, respectively, while Industry. Construction and Services recorded negative growth of -093, -026 and -008 percentage point, respectively. Prices The Committee noted a further increase in year-on-year headline inflation to 1277 per cent and 1372 percent in March and April 2016, respectively, from 1138 per cent in February 2016. The increase in headline inflation in April reflected increases in both food and core components of inflation. Core inflation rose sharply for the third time in a row to 1335 per cent in April from 1217 per cent in March, 1100 per cent in February and 880 per cent in January having stayed at 870 per cent for three consecutive months through December, 2015. Food inflation also rose to 1319 per cent from 1274 per cent in March, 1135 per cent in February, 1064 per cent in January and 1059 per cent in December, 2015. The rising inflationary pressure continued to be traced to legacy factors including energy crisis reflected in incessant scarcity of refined petroleum products, exchange rate pass through from imported goods, high cost of electricity, high transport cost, reduction in food output, high cost of inputs and low industrial output. The Committee observed that in an economy characterized by high import dependence, the shortage of foreign exchange provided some basis for price increases as currently being experienced. The Committee noted that the economy needed to aggressively earn and build up its stock of foreign reserves in order to avoid distortions when faced with severe shocks. The Committee further noted that the current inflation trend, being largely a product of structural rigidities and inadequate foreign exchange earnings would continue to be closely monitored, and in coordination with fiscal policy, with a view to addressing the underlying drivers of the upward price movements. Monetary Credit and Financial Markets Developments Broad money supply (M2) grew by 349 per cent in April 2016, a 129 percentage growth from the March level of 220 per cent and compared with the 367 per cent in April 2015. When annualized. M2 grew by 1047 per cent in April 2016 against the provisional growth benchmark of 1098 per cent for 2016. Net domestic credit (NDC) grew by 787 per cent in the same period and annualized at 2361 per cent. At this rate, the growth rate of NDC was above the provisional benchmark of 1794 per cent for 2016. The development in NDC essentially reflected the significant growth in credit to government of 3597 per cent in the month, annualized to 10791 per cent. Credit to the private sector grew by 352 per cent in April 2016, which annualized to a growth of 1056 per cent, below the benchmark growth of 1328 per cent. The Committee observed with concern, the continuous dismal performance of growth in credit to the private sector, noting that in spite of the Bank's efforts. DMBs continued to direct credit largely to low employment elastic sectors of the economy, a phenomenon that had significantly contributed to the low performance of the economy. Money market interest rates reflected the continuing liquidity surfeit in the banking system. Average inter-bank call rate, which stood at 450 per cent on 21st March 2016, closed at 867 per cent on March 18, 2016. Between March 25th and 14th April 2016, interbank call rate averaged 200 per cent. The Committee noted a decline in activity in the inter-bank market in the period under review, which was due to the payment of FAAC statutory allocations and the maturity of CBN securities. The Committee also noted a further improvement in the equities segment of the capital market as the All-Share Index (ASI) rose by 334 per cent from 25,,89991 on March 24, 2016 to 26,,76386 on May 18, 2016. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) rose by 314 per cent from N891 trillion to N919 trillion during the same period. However relative to end- December 2015, the indices declined by 656 per cent and 670 per cent, respectively. Globally however, the equities markets were generally bearish. External Sector Developments The average naira exchange rate remained stable at the inter-bank segment of the foreign exchange market during the review period. The exchange rate at the interbank market opened at N19700/US$ and closed 7 at N19700/US$, with a daily average of N197/US$ between March 25 and May 13, 2016. The Committee, therefore, remains committed to its mandate of maintaining a stable naira exchange rate. The MPC noted the level of activity in the autonomous foreign exchange market especially, following the deregulation of the downstream petroleum sector with attendant increased demand in the interbank market, thus further exerting pressure on the naira. The Committee recalls that over the last two consecutive meetings, it had signaled the imperative of reform of the foreign exchange market. In the intervening period, the Committee interrogated the issues around the current foreign exchange market regime, tracing them to the low foreign exchange earnings of the economy. Consequently in the Committee's opinion, the key issue remains how to increase the supply of foreign exchange to the economy. The Committee observed that while the Bank has been working on a menu of options to ensure increased supply of foreign exchange, there was no easy and quick fix to the foreign exchange scarcity problem as supply remained essentially a function of exports and the investment climate. The Committee is aware that a dynamic foreign exchange management framework that guarantees flexibility could not replace the imperative for the economy to increase its stock of foreign exchange through enhanced export earnings. Consequently such a structure must evolve to provide basis for radically improved investment climate to attract new investments. The Committee recognizes the exchange rate as a very important macroeconomic variable, which must be earned by increased productive 8 activity and exports, noting with satisfaction that the Bank had made very significant and satisfactory progress with the reforms framework. The Committee was of the view that the current adverse global and domestic economic and financial conditions and the imperative imposed by the demand and supply shocks to the domestic economy and considering the express intensions of Government as enunciated in the 2016 budget, policy must respond appropriately as the market continues to demonstrate confidence in the Bank's ability to deliver a credible foreign exchange market. Accordingly the MPC decided that the Bank should embrace some level of flexibility in the foreign exchange market. Given the imperative for growth, the Management of the Bank has been given the mandate to work out the modalities for achieving the desired flexibility that is in the overall interest of the Nigerian economy and when the implementation of the new framework would begin. The Committee's Considerations The Committee acknowledged the severely weakened macroeconomic environment, as reflected particularly in increased inflationary pressure, contraction in real output and rising unemployment. The Committee recalls that in July 2015, it had hinted on the possibility of the economy falling into recession unless appropriate complementary measures were taken by the monetary and fiscal authorities. Unfortunately the delayed passage of the 2016 budget constrained the much desired fiscal stimulus, thus edging the economy towards contractionary output. As a stop-gap measure, the Central Bank continued to deploy all the instruments within its control in the hope of keeping the economy afloat. The actions, however, proved 9 insufficient to fully avert the impending economic contraction. With some of the conditions that led to the contraction in Q1, 2016 still largely unresolved, the weak outlook for growth which was signaled in July 2015 could extend to Q2. To this effect, today's policy actions have to be predicated on a less optimistic outlook for the economy in the short term, given that, even after the delayed budgetary passage in May 2016, the initial monetary injection approved by the Federal Government may not impact the economy soon, as the processes involved in MDAs finalizing procurement contracts before the disbursement of funds may further delay the much needed financial stimulus to restart growth. The Committee noted that the CBN had implemented accommodative monetary policy from July 2015, with the hope of achieving growth, up until March 2016, when the MPC switched into a tightening mode. However while the underlying conditions necessitating tight monetary policy remained largely in place, sundry administrative measures implemented by the Bank and recent macroeconomic conditions on the back of the 2016 Budget are expected to significantly dictate a key policy preference in the dilemma now faced by monetary policy - stagflation. Given the current limited policy space, it is imperative to balance stability with growth stance while working on options that in the short term, are certain to isolate seasonal and transient factors fuelling the current price spiral. Other than credit to government, growth in all monetary aggregates remained largely below their indicative benchmarks, yet; headline inflation spiked in April 2016, far above the upper limit of the policy reference band. 10 Inflation has continued to be driven mainly by supply side factors such as fuel scarcity, increase in tariff and deterioration in electricity supply, increase in the price of petrol, higher input costs as a result of scarcity of foreign exchange, persistent security challenges and exchange rate pass- through to domestic prices of import. While the Committee believed that the recent deregulation of the downstream sector of the petroleum sector was in the right direction and would lead to increased supply, the pass-through effect of prices to other products has to be factored in policy considerations. Mindful of the limitations of monetary policy in influencing structural imbalances in the economy, the Committee stressed the need for policy coordination with the fiscal authorities in order to effectively address the identified pressure points. The Committee noted that the continued excess liquidity in the banking system was responsible for the low level of activity in the interbank market. This is in addition to contributing to the sustained pressure in the foreign exchange market. The Committee expressed hope that efficient implementation of the recently passed 2016 Federal Budget, especially; the capital expenditure portion, would help invigorate growth in the economy as business confidence rejuvenates. The Committee expressed concern over sustained pressure in the foreign exchange market and the necessity of implementing reforms to engender greater flexibility of rate and transparency in the operation of the inter-bank foreign exchange market. Accordingly the Committee noted that it was time to introduce greater flexibility in the management of the foreign exchange market. The Committee reaffirmed commitment towards 11 maintenance of price stability and reiterated the need to reappraise the coordination mechanism between monetary and fiscal policy and initiate reforms, for the purpose of more efficient policy synchronization and management. The Committee's Decisions The Committee, in its assessment of the relevant risk profiles, came to the conclusion that although, the balance of risks remains tilted against growth; previous decisions need time to crystalize. Consequently in a period of stagflation, the policy options are very limited. To avoid complicating the conditions, the Committee decided on the least risky option to hold. The foreign exchange market framework, now ready, the MPC voted unanimously to adopt greater flexibility in exchange rate policy to restore the automatic adjustment properties of the exchange rate. Consequently all 9 members voted to hold and introduce greater flexibility in managing the foreign exchange rate. The Bank would however, retain a small window for funding critical transactions. Details of operation of the market would be released by the Bank at an appropriate time. In summary, the MPC voted to: Retain the MPR at 1200 per cent; Retain the CRR at 2250 per cent; Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 3000 per cent; and Retain the Asymmetric Window at +200 and -500 basis points around the MPR 12 Introduce greater flexibility in the inter-bank foreign exchange market structure and to retain a small window for critical transactions. Thank you for listening. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 24th May 2016 13."
Turkiye,2016-05-24,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 10 percent to 9.50 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 11.50 percent to 11 percent. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. While domestic demand continues to have a positive impact on growth, demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports. Accordingly economic activity displays a moderate and stable course of growth. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Recently, the global volatility has increased to some extent. The Committee assesses that the tight monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policies and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August 2015 increase the resilience of the economy against shocks. In this respect, the Committee decided to take a measured step towards simplification. Recently, inflation has displayed a marked decline, mainly due to unprocessed food prices. However, improvement in the underlying core inflation trend remains limited, necessitating the maintenance of a tight liquidity stance. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2016-05-26,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the key policy rate to 18%, effective 27 May 2016. The move was made possible due to a steady disinflation trend, which is consistent with the inflation objectives for 2016 and 2017. In April 2016, as expected, twelve-month headline inflation slowed to single-digits for the first time in two years, reaching 9.8% y-o-y. However, in monthly terms, inflation was higher than in the previous months, standing at 3.5% m-o-m. The increase in monthly inflation reflected the elimination of preferential natural gas tariffs for households, effective through 31 March 2016. Yet, headline inflation posted only a 5.1% year-to-date increase. The downward trend in core inflation in April 2016 was in line with the NBU's expectations,, reflecting weakening fundamental factors such as lower inflation pressures. Disinflation was underpinned by subdued domestic consumer demand, tight monetary policy, and appreciation of the hryvnia exchange rate observed in recent months. In Q1 2016, real GDP posted a modest increase in annual terms (0.1%), reflecting weaker recovery in domestic demand. Annual GDP growth was slower than projected. Consumer demand remained subdued, reflecting weaker real wage growth. In March, real wages posted an annualized increase of 1.6% for the first time in two years. However, overall in Q1 2016, real wage growth was 6.8% lower than in the same period a year ago. Although businesses benefited from additional financial resourses released as a result of lower allocations to social funds, the increase in real wages was moderate and insufficient to trigger inflation pressures. Disinflation was supported by a gradual appreciation of the hryvnia exchange rate, which was underpinned by improved external conditions, and, as a consequence, higher foreign exchange receipts from exports. These developments enabled the NBU, which remained firmly committed to a flexible exchange rate, to purchase foreign currency to replenish its international reserves, while not hampering a gradual appreciation of the exchange rate triggered by fundamental factors. The NBU believes that the 2016 and 2017 end-year inflation targets set at 12% +/-3% and 8% +/-2%, respectively, remain within reach. Given the upward adjustment of tariffs for heating and hot water recently announced by the government, administered prices are expected to be a major contributor to the Consumer Price Index in 2016. However, in 2017, their contribution to the CPI is likely to be less significant than projected in the Inflation Report (April 2016). Increases in administered prices and tariffs accounted for temporary surges in inflation in some months of 2016. However, their further adjustment to cost-recovery levels (market levels) will not require the NBU to pursue a tighter monetary policy. First, in the medium-term, this move will contribute to keeping inflation on a downward path through the elimination of distortions in price-setting mechanisms in the periods ahead. Second, this adjustment will help contain pressures on inflation from households' effective demand for other goods and services as early as in 2016. Accordingly, due to this and other factors, the upward pressure on headline inflation from domestic demand-side factors is expected to be insignificant over the forecast horizon. Instead, economic recovery will be driven by investments and supported by external demand. The continuation of cooperation with the IMF is critical for achieving price stability. Accordingly, the Government's resolve to move urgent reforms forward and the support of parliament is essential to keeping the program on track. Should risks to price stability abate further, the NBU will move ahead with monetary easing to support the economic recovery. The decision to cut the key policy rate to 18% is approved by NBU Board Decision No. 25-psh, dated 26 May 2016. On Money Market Regulation. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held as scheduled on 23 June 2016."
Colombia,2016-05-27,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 7.25%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. Annual consumer inflation fell in April and stood at 7.93%. In contrast, the average of core inflation indicators increased, reaching 6.38%. Analysts' inflation expectations to one and two years posted at 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively, and those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years are between 4.3% and 4.7%. The slight decline of annual inflation in April was explained mainly by decreases in energy prices. However, increases in food prices and the pass-through of nominal depreciation to consumer prices continue to exert inflationary pressures. In spite of being temporary shocks, the intensity of El Nino and the magnitude of the depreciation of the peso have diverted inflation and inflation expectations from the target, and have activated some indexation mechanisms. The figures for global economic activity for the second quarter suggest that the dynamics of global output will be greater than in the first. However, it is likely that the average growth of Colombia's trading partners in 2016 be lower than the one observed in 2015. The increase of the benchmark interest rate by the Federal Reserve of the United States could take place before than expected in previous months. In this environment, the peso and other world currencies depreciated. The price of oil continued to increase and continues at levels higher than expected for this year. With this, the fall in the terms of trade and national income could be lower than what had been expected before. The information available indicates that in the first quarter household spending grew at a pace similar to that recorded a quarter ago, while investment slowed down. With this, the technical staff continues projecting growth at 2.5% in the first quarter, and throughout 2016 within a range between 1.5% and 3.2%. In all, the Colombian economy is adjusting in an orderly manner to the strong external shocks recorded since 2014. The risk of an excessive deceleration of domestic demand is moderate, and there is still an excess of expenditure with respect to national income, which is reflected in a high current account deficit. Inflation has accelerated on account of the depreciation of the peso. El Nino, and by the activation of some indexation mechanisms. In this environment, the response of the monetary policy must acknowledge that the shocks which have affected prices are transitory, while being oriented to ensure convergence of inflation to the target of 3.0% =C2=B11 percentage point in 2017. With this purpose, the Board deemed appropriate to increase the benchmark reference rate by 25 basis points. The adjustment of the monetary policy will also contribute to the correction of the external deficit. The Board will continue to monitor the expected adjustment of expenditure and its consistency with the income level for long-term sustainability of the external deficit, and, in general, for macroeconomic stability. Similarly, it reaffirms its commitment to keep inflation and inflation expectations anchored to the target, acknowledging that there has been a transitory increase in inflation. Finally, the Board announced that it will not summon a new auction of options to decumulate foreign reserves, and will continue to use the intervention mechanisms according to their suitability in order to achieve the Central Bank's policy objectives. Bogot."
Euroarea,2016-06-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I would like to thank Governor Nowotny for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that the monthly asset purchases of €80 billion are intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. As a next step, on 8 June we will start making purchases under our corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP). Moreover, starting on 22 June, we will conduct the first operation in our new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations. Further information on implementation aspects of the CSPP will be released after the press conference on the ECB's website. The comprehensive package of decisions taken in early March underpins the momentum of the euro area's economic recovery and fosters the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2%. In particular, our measures continue to ease the cost of credit and contribute to a strengthening in credit creation. Additional stimulus, beyond the impetus already taken into account, is expected from the monetary policy measures still to be implemented and will contribute to further rebalancing the risks to the outlook for growth and inflation. In the current context, it is crucial to ensure that the very low inflation environment does not become entrenched in second-round effects on wage and price setting. The Governing Council will closely monitor the evolution of the outlook for price stability and, if warranted to achieve its objective, will act by using all the instruments available within its mandate. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.5%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2016, after 0.3% in the last quarter of 2015. Growth continues to be supported by domestic demand, while being dampened by weak exports. The latest data point to ongoing growth in the second quarter, though possibly at a lower rate than in the first quarter. Looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to proceed at a moderate but steady pace. Domestic demand remains supported by the pass-through of our monetary policy measures to the real economy. Favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability continue to promote investment. Moreover, sustained employment gains, which are also benefiting from past structural reforms, and still relatively low oil prices provide additional support for households' real disposable income and private consumption. In addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is slightly expansionary. However, the economic recovery in the euro area continues to be dampened by subdued growth prospects in emerging markets, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. This outlook is broadly reflected in the June 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.6% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017 and 2018. Compared with the March 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised up for 2016 and has remained broadly unchanged for 2017 and 2018. The risks to the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, but the balance of risks has improved on the back of the monetary policy measures taken and the stimulus still in the pipeline. Downside risks continue to relate to developments in the global economy, to the upcoming British referendum and to other geopolitical risks. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation in May 2016 was -0.1%, up from -0.2% in April, mainly reflecting higher energy and services price inflation. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are likely to remain very low or negative in the next few months before picking up in the second half of 2016, in large part owing to base effects in the annual rate of change of energy prices. Supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should recover further in 2017 and 2018. This broad pattern is also reflected in the June 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 0.2% in 2016, 1.3% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018. In comparison with the March 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised slightly up for 2016, reflecting recent oil price increases, and has remained unchanged for 2017 and 2018. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continued to grow at a robust pace in April 2016, with its annual rate of growth standing at 4.6%, after 5.0% in March. As in previous months, annual growth in M3 is mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 9.7% in April, after 10.1% in March. Loan dynamics followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 1.2% in April 2016, compared with 1.1% in March. Developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained broadly stable at 1.5% in April, after 1.6% in March. The monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 have clearly improved borrowing conditions for firms and households, as well as credit flows across the euro area. The comprehensive package of new monetary policy measures adopted in March this year underpins the ongoing upturn in loan growth, thereby supporting the recovery of the real economy. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need to preserve an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. As emphasised repeatedly by the Governing Council, and as again strongly echoed in both European and international policy discussions, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the European levels. Structural policies are essential, given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area. Structural reforms are necessary in all euro area countries, although specific reform needs differ across the individual economies. At this stage, the focus should be on actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, which are vital to increase investment and boost job creation. The enhancement of current investment initiatives, including the extension of the Juncker plan, and progress on the capital markets union will also contribute positively to this objective. In an environment of accommodative monetary policy, the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms, in line with the country-specific recommendations recently published by the European Commission, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also make the euro area more resilient to global shocks. Fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. Full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact over time and across countries is crucial to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework. At the same time, all countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies."
Kazakhstan,2016-06-06,"PRESS - RELEASE #14 On the base rate June 6, 2016 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to keep the base rate unchanged at 15% with an interest rate corridor of +/- 1%. The decision reflects the balance of risks to financial stability that stem from high costs of funding on the one hand and risks to price stability in the medium-term on the other hand. In more detail, the decision reflected the following considerations. Demand for Tenge continues to recover. Households persist in net selling of foreign currency bills. Net conversion of foreign currency deposits to tenge deposits continues. At end- April 2016 the share of foreign currency deposits declined to 72% for households deposits and to 53% for corporate clients. April 2016 also marked first increase in Tenge-denominated lending since October 2015. Inflation remains within the expected trend. NBK's inflation expectation survey shows almost no change in May 2016. Only 37.7% of the respondents expect higher or the same level of inflation (in April 2016 at 37.1%). Economic activity and domestic demand indicators continue to decline, exerting a negative impact on economic growth. Industrial production indicator for January-April 2016 declined. High investment demand and rising public sector spending partially offset the negative impact of the terms of trade shock. After the NBK lowered the base rate and narrowed the interest rate corridor on May 6, 2016, monetary conditions eased somewhat. Money market rates remain at the floor of the interest rate corridor. A wider surplus of primary liquidity persists due to the continued conversion of foreign exchange deposits into tenge deposits as well as due to fiscal factors. External and domestic risks remain. This may affect foreign currency market, money market and inflation expectations. After the base rate was lowered, the cost of hedging foreign currency risks has not risen and remains below the money market rates. Should the risks recede and provided that emergent trends are confirmed, further cuts cannot be ruled out. The size of the cut will depend on the response of the economy to the external shocks and monetary policy shocks, including, but not limited to, lower medium-term inflation forecast, the cost of hedging foreign currency risks, and currency preferences of bank depositors. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on July 11, 2016 at 17.00 Astana time.

India,2016-06-07,"Second Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2016-17 By Dr.Raghuram G. Rajan. Governor Governor's Opening Remarks at the Press Conference Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.5 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL); and continue to provide liquidity as required but progressively lower the average ex ante liquidity deficit in the system from one per cent of NDTL to a position closer to neutrality. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 6.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 7.0 per cent. Assessment 2. Since the first bi-monthly statement of April 2016, global growth is uneven and struggling to gain traction. World trade remains muted in an environment of weak demand. In the United States, growth was slow once again in Q1 because of contracting industrial activity and exports. Recent indicators of labour market activity have also weakened. In the Euro area, by contrast. Q1 GDP rose strongly on the back of robust consumer spending and recovering employment and business conditions. In Q2 so far, unemployment is falling, albeit slowly, and purchasing managers' sentiment is upbeat. In Japan, growth surprised on the upside in Q1, with the economy escaping a technical recession, but industrial activity remains weak and deflationary pressures are building. GDP growth slowed sequentially in China in Q1, with retail sales, industrial production and fixed investment showing signs of weakness in recent months amidst still rising levels of indebtedness among households and corporations. While macroeconomic stability is returning to some emerging market economies (EMEs), geo-political tensions and high volatility in financial markets impede the resumption of momentum, and the outlook remains challenging. The recent uptick in commodity2 prices is providing some relief to commodity exporters but political events could unsettle investor sentiment and consequently, capital flows could turn volatile again. For commodity importers, net terms of trade gains are moderating. Global financial markets have recorded gains through Q2 of 2016, spurred by risk-on investor sentiment. Portfolio flows are returning, albeit hesitantly, to EME debt and equity markets. The firmness in crude prices that set in around mid-March has been supported in subsequent weeks by some temporary reductions in global supply. Gold prices remain elevated on safe haven demand. Other non-energy commodity prices remain stable with a hint of upside, while steel prices have firmed appreciably. Bond market yields across AEs have eased steadily, reflecting strong appetite in primary auctions in the face of the growing universe of negative yielding bonds. The US dollar continues to mirror changes in expectations of monetary policy action by the Fed. The yen and the euro have remained strong despite ultra- accommodative monetary policies. Among EMEs, some currencies are trading with an appreciating bias, with the biggest gains recorded by the currencies that had depreciated the most earlier. On the domestic front, the recently released provisional estimate of gross value added (GVA) for 2015-16 marginally scaled down the annual growth rate to 7.2 per cent, on a deceleration of services sector activity in relation to the advance estimates. There was, however, a sequential pickup in activity in Q4 in line with expectations. As regards the current financial year, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast an above-normal and well-distributed south west monsoon as El Nino wanes  albeit with a slightly delayed onset. Realisation of this prediction is critical for the outlook for agriculture since reservoir levels have been depleted to 17 per cent of capacity  40 per cent lower than the level a year ago. Even though rabi procurement was lower in April-May 2016 than a year ago, mid- May food stocks at 58 million tonnes were almost three times the norm for Q1. The index of industrial production decelerated in 2015-16, mainly pulled down by weak manufacturing in an environment of subdued investment demand and weak rural consumption. In May 2016, the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) remained subdued on account of slowing output and export orders. However, except for natural gas and crude oil, the core sector registered strong growth in April 2016 on account of a seasonal pick-up in industries like electricity, also supported by a low base. There are signs that corporate performance is improving. Available information on Q4 earnings suggests double digit growth in EBITDA levels for non- financial corporates. The Reserve Bank's latest rounds of forward looking surveys indicate an improvement in the overall business situation, driven by a pick-up in capacity utilisation and in order books  both domestic and external. These developments have improved the expectation of business conditions in the first half of 2016-17. Public investment, especially in roads and railways, is gaining strength, though the continuing weakness in private investment is of concern. Demand conditions are likely to improve going forward; consumer confidence is seen as rising on improving expectations of employment and spending, with rural demand aided by a stronger monsoon. Rising capacity utilisation should prompt private investment. Some high frequency indicators for April point to a firming recovery, although it is still uneven. Leading the upturn are cargo traffic at major ports, automobile sales (especially two-wheelers and three-wheelers), commercial vehicle sales, passenger air and freight traffic, cement production and steel consumption. Abstracting from seasonal effects, this suggests that the expansion, especially in the service sector, is getting broad-based. On the other hand, railway freight traffic and passenger car3 sales have decelerated on sector-specific constraints. Purchasing managers in the services sector indicated slowing new business in May and subdued expectations of future activity. The ebbing of inflation pressures for two consecutive months to March, after a period of steady rise, was interrupted once again in April. Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose more sharply than expected due to a more-than- seasonal jump in food prices. Within the food group, inflation in respect of vegetables, fruits, sugar, meat and fish rose sizably from their prints in the previous month. Inflation in respect of pulses remained elevated; the recent decline in prices of pulses reversed, yielding a sharp increase in April. Production of pulses has fallen for the second consecutive year, according to the third advance estimates for 2015-16. There was also a firming of inflation relating to edible oils, spices and non-alcoholic beverages. Cereal inflation, however, remained subdued, reflecting supply management efforts that expanded offtake from food stocks. Inflation in respect of the fuel group eased mainly due to firewood and stronger deflation in respect of LPG prices. Reflecting these recent inflation dynamics, three-months-ahead inflation expectations of households moved up marginally in May. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel edged up in April, driven by prices of petrol and diesel embedded in transport and communication. Clothing and footwear also registered moderate increases in inflation. Services inflation remained elevated on account of house rents, water charges, tuition fees and taxi/auto fares. Excluding petrol and diesel from this category, inflation was sticky and above 5 per cent. However, since growth in rural wages and corporate staff costs have been modest, cost-push factors may be subdued for the time being. Despite the waning of liquidity pressures in early April, stronger-than-usual currency demand during the first two months of the financial year and build-up of cash balances by the Government from the second week of May tightened liquidity conditions from mid-May. In order to mitigate these pressures, the Reserve Bank injected liquidity through purchases under open market operations (OMOs) of 700 billion during April-May in pursuance of the revised liquidity management framework outlined in the April bi-monthly policy statement. Additionally, liquidity was injected through variable rate repos of various tenors, in addition to the regular 14-day term repos and overnight fixed rate repo and MSF. The average daily net liquidity injection through the liquidity adjustment facility (including MSF) declined from 1935 billion in March 2016 to 1030 billion during April-May and further to 120 billion in June (up to June 5, 2016). The weighted average call money rate (WACR) remained closely anchored to the policy rate within a narrower corridor of +/- 50 basis points around the policy repo rate. Volatility also declined significantly. Interest rates on money market instruments such as certificates of deposit (CDs) and commercial paper (CPs) also eased through the quarter so far. Exports declined for the seventeenth consecutive month in April in US dollar terms in spite of a modest increase in volume. The fall in crude oil prices led to lower export realisations from petroleum products (POL), although the volume of shipments of petroleum products is estimated to have picked up modestly. Among non-oil items, exports of gems and jewellery, drugs and pharmaceuticals, chemicals and electronic goods improved over their levels a year ago. By contrast, exports of engineering goods declined for the ninth straight month while readymade garments recorded a fall for the fourth successive month. Imports fell sharply and across constituents  25 items accounting for a share of 87 per cent in total imports recorded a decline; POL imports also declined, essentially reflecting lower prices. Accordingly, the trade4 deficit narrowed sequentially and was less than half its level a year ago. Portfolio flows resumed in April and May. The level of foreign exchange reserves rose to US $ 360 billion by May 27, 2016. Policy Stance and Rationale 12. The inflation surprise in the April reading makes the future trajectory of inflation somewhat more uncertain. The expectations of a normal monsoon and a reasonable spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall, along with various supply management measures and the introduction of the electronic national agriculture market (e-NAM) trading portal, should moderate unanticipated flares of food inflation. In addition, capacity utilisation indicators suggest that the available headroom in industry could keep output prices subdued even as demand picks up. Nonetheless, there are upside risks  firming international commodity prices, particularly of crude oil; the implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission awards which will have to be factored into projections as soon as clarity on implementation emerges; the upturn in inflation expectations of households and of corporates; and the stickiness in inflation excluding food and fuel. Taking these factors into account, the inflation projections given in the April policy statement are retained, though with an upside bias. Considerable uncertainty surrounds these projections (Chart 1), which should be clarified by incoming data in the next few months. Domestic conditions for growth are improving gradually, mainly driven by consumption demand, which is expected to strengthen with a normal monsoon and the implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission award. Higher public sector capital expenditure, led by roads and railways, should crowd in private investment, offsetting somewhat the subdued appetite for fresh private investment due to financial stress. Yet, business confidence will be restrained to an extent on account of unrelenting global factors. On a reassessment of balance of risks, therefore, the GVA growth projection for 2016-17 has been retained at 7.6 per cent with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).5 14. In its bi-monthly monetary policy statement of April 2016, the Reserve Bank stated that it would watch macroeconomic and financial developments in the months ahead with a view to responding as space opens up. Incoming data since then show a sharper-than-anticipated upsurge in inflationary pressures emanating from a number of food items (beyond seasonal effects), as well as a reversal in commodity prices. A strong monsoon, continued astute food management, as well as steady expansion in supply capacity, especially in services, could help offset these upward pressures. Given the uncertainties, the Reserve Bank will stay on hold, but the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. The Reserve Bank will monitor macroeconomic and financial developments for any further scope for policy action. More monetary transmission to support the revival of growth continues to be critical. The government's reform measures on small savings rates combined with the Reserve Bank's refinements in the liquidity management framework should help the transmission of past policy rate reductions into lending rates of banks. The Reserve Bank will shortly review the implementation of the Marginal Cost Lending Rate framework by banks. Timely capital infusions into constrained public sector banks will also aid credit flow. The third bi-monthly monetary policy statement will be announced on August 9, 2016."
Poland,2016-06-08,"Warsaw, 8 June 2016 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 7-8 June 2016 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 1.50%;  lombard rate at 2.50%;  deposit rate at 0.50%;  rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic growth remains moderate, while uncertainty remains about its outlook. In the euro area, a gradual recovery continues, although weak economic conditions in emerging countries have a negative impact on the region's economic outlook. In the United States, despite a slowdown in GDP growth in 2016 Q1, moderate economic growth is expected to continue. In turn, in China incoming data indicate a further deceleration of economic growth, while Russia and Brazil remain in recession. Prices of oil and many other commodities in the global markets  despite some increase in recent months  are still markedly lower than in previous years. The main factors behind very low consumer price growth in many economies are low commodity prices, combined with moderate global economic activity. In some economies  including the euro area  price growth is negative. The European Central Bank is keeping the interest rates at a very low level, including the deposit rate below zero, and continues financial asset purchases. At the same time, the Federal Reserve  after increasing the interest rates in December  is keeping the rates unchanged, while indicating a possible interest rate rise in the future. In Poland. GDP growth slowed down in 2016 Q1. This was driven primarily by the fall in investment, which was partly related to the completion of projects co-financed with EU funds under the previous financial framework. At the same time, growth of consumer demand remained stable, supported by growing employment, improving consumer sentiment and growth in lending to households. Taking into account the continuing sound financial standing of enterprises and their high capacity utilization, the fall in investment  and thus also the weakening of economic growth  at the beginning of 2016 was most likely temporary. The increase in consumer spending resulting from the launch of the ""Family 500+"" programme will also contribute to GDP growth in the coming quarters. Yet, the uncertainty about economic conditions abroad continues to be a risk factor for domestic economic activity. With negative output gap and moderate growth of average nominal wages, currently there is no inflationary pressure in the economy. Annual consumer price growth and producer price growth remain negative. External factors  particularly the earlier sharp 1/2 fall in global commodity prices and low price growth in the environment of the Polish economy  continue to be the main sources of deflation. This is accompanied by very low inflation expectations. The persisting deflation has not adversely affected decisions of economic agents so far. In the Council's assessment, price growth will stay negative in the coming quarters due to the earlier substantial decline in global commodity prices. At the same time. GDP growth is expected to remain stable in the coming quarters, following a temporary deceleration early this year. Consumer demand will continue to be the main driver of economic growth, supported by rising employment, forecasted acceleration of wage growth and an increase in social benefits. This notwithstanding, the downside risks to the global economic conditions and the volatility of commodity prices remain the sources of uncertainty for the domestic economy and price developments. The Council maintains its assessment that  given the available data and forecasts  the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance."
South Korea,2016-06-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 1.50% to 1.25%. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.50% to 1.25%. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the US economy has appeared to be emerging from its temporary slowdown. The improvements in the euro area, although weak, have continued, and the Chinese economy has maintained its moderate growth. The Board forecasts that, while the global economy will maintain its weak recovery going forward, it will be affected by factors including the monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, financial and economic conditions in emerging market countries, and international oil price movements. Looking at the Korean economy, exports have continued their trend of decline and the improvements in domestic demand activities such as consumption have weakened, while the sentiments of economic agents have also been sluggish. On the employment front, although the pace of increase in the number of persons employed slowed somewhat in April, the employment-to-population ratio and the unemployment rate maintained the same levels as in April of last year. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of modest growth going forward, but in view of economic conditions domestically and abroad judges that the downside risks to the growth path forecast made in April have expanded. Consumer price inflation fell from 1.0% the month before to 0.8% in May, owing chiefly to a slowdown in the extent of increase in agricultural product prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also declined to 1.6%, from 1.8% in April. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will continue at a low level, under the influence of the low oil prices for example. In the housing market, sales and leasehold deposit prices showed low rates of increase. In the domestic financial markets since May, stock prices have risen after having previously fallen, in reflection mainly of global stock market movements, and long- term market interest rates have declined, influenced mostly by the sluggishness of some economic indicators. The Korean won has fluctuated to a large extent against the US dollar, affected mainly by changes in the expectations for a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. The won has meanwhile depreciated against the Japanese yen. Household lending has sustained a trend of substantial increase at a level exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying greater attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the possibility of a British exit from the European Union, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries and capital flow movements, the progress of corporate restructuring, and the trend of increase in household debt."
Russia,2016-06-10,"On 10 June 2016, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to reduce the key rate from 11.00 to 10.50 % p.a. The Board of Directors notes the positive trends of more stable inflation, decreased inflation expectations and inflation risks against the backdrop of imminent growth recovery in the economy. Slowing inflation allows more certain reliance on sustainable inflation reduction to less than 5% in May 2017 and the 4% target in late 2017, taking into account the decision just made and the retention moderately tight monetary policy. The Bank of Russia will consider the possibility of a further rate cut based on estimates for inflation risks and alignment of inflation decline with the forecast trajectory. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors has proceeded from the following factors. First. There is more confidence in steadily positive trends in the inflation dynamics. Consumer prices grew less than predicted. The annual inflation has stabilised at 7.3% and the annualised monthly inflation, seasonally adjusted, is about 5%. Economic activity indicators improve along with ongoing low consumer demand and a high rate of savings without creating upward pressure on consumer prices. Inflation expectations of households and businesses continue to decrease. The situation in the global commodity markets was more favourable than expected and contributed to the inflation slowdown through the ruble exchange rate and food price movements (these factors' influence is temporary and is subject to decrease, which is considered in the inflation forecast). The administered prices and tariffs will be adjusted in July in compliance with the stated plans, but to a lesser extent than a year ago. Consumer price growth rates will keep on going down further, primarily influenced by the demand-side restraints. The Bank of Russia marked down its inflation forecast for the end of 2016, to 5-6%. Considering the decision just made and retaining the current monetary policy stance, the annual inflation will be less than 5% in May 2017 to reach the 4% target in late 2017. Second. Positive trends in the economy are not accompanied by a higher inflationary pressure. The figures of the GDP dynamics in 2016 Q1 and macroeconomic indicators for April confirm greater sustainability of the Russian economy to oil price fluctuations. Import substitution and non-commodity exports continue to expand and additional growth areas in manufacturing are taking shape. However, the changes in economic dynamics vary across the industries and regions. Investments continue to show a downward trend and a wide range of industries experience stagnation, including those that have traditionally been the sources of growth for the Russian economy. Yet positive shifts in the economy anticipate the beginning of its growth recovery. Quarterly GDP growth is expected no later than 2016 H2. The forecast predicts a GDP increase of 1.3% in 2017 and annual growth rate for output of goods and services remaining low in the following years. The forecast is based on a fairly conservative estimate of the annual average oil price, which is approximately $40 per barrel over the three-year horizon. Third. Monetary conditions will still be moderately tight, despite a slight easing due to the lowering banking sector liquidity deficit. Real interest rates in the economy (adjusted for inflation expectations) will remain at the level that encourages savings and allows for demand for loans that does not cause an increase in inflationary pressure. In order to ensure operational control over the level and structure of market interest rates in the context of the emerging transition to the banking sector liquidity surplus, the Bank of Russia is ready to take a set of measures designed to mop up liquidity. Fourth. The risks that inflation will not reach the target of 4% in 2017 declined, but still remain at a heightened level. This primarily stems from inflation expectation inertness, the lack of mid-term budget consolidation strategy and the uncertainty in the parameters of future indexation of wages and pensions. Volatility in the global commodity and financial markets also might have a negative impact on the exchange rate and inflation expectations. The materialisation of these risks might cause a slowdown in the inflation reduction. The Bank of Russia will consider the possibility of a further rate cut based on estimates for inflation risks and alignment of inflation decline with the forecast trajectory. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 29 July 2016. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Thailand,2016-06-10,"1 - Summary Conclusion of the Joint Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 9 June 2016 The Bank of Thailand announced the summary conclusion of the joint meeting of MPC and FIPC on 9 June 2016 to assess the risks to Thailand's financial stability as follows. Thailand's overall economic and financial stability remained sound, as reflected by the strong financial position of financial institutions and large corporates. Even though there was some deterioration of loan quality due to the slow economic recovery and the consequence of the recent drought, especially loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and agricultural households. Thai financial institutions still had high provision and capital. Thailand's external financial stability also remained sound with continued current account surplus and high level of international reserves, which would provide cushion against external risk factors, including monetary policy divergence among major industrial countries, default situations of China's large corporates as well as uncertainty regarding the Brexit referendum. The search-for-yield behavior could increase further amid prolonged low interest rate environment, as reflected by a larger proportion of investments being allocated to riskier assets by investors. At the same time, there were signs of more high-risk investment products being offered; for example, complex instruments and unrated bonds, which could possibly lead to the underpricing of risks by some investors. Therefore investors should understand the risks embedded in the products as well as their own risk tolerance. In addition, the sellers must provide investors with clear, transparent and complete information, especially regarding the risks of the products. The relevant regulators, including the Bank of Thailand, the Office of Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Office of Insurance Commission have closely monitored the risks and continued to enhance regulations in order to appropriately address those risks. The Committees also supported the government's intention to revamp the regulatory and supervisory framework for the savings cooperatives to be in line with the risks and underlying philosophy of cooperatives. This is because the savings cooperatives have grown larger in size and connectedness to the financial system and also involved a wide circle of parties and individuals."
Georgia,2016-06-15,"15.06.16 NBG Reduces Its Policy Rate by 50 basis points to 7.0% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on June 15, 2016 and decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 50 basis points to 7.0 percent. The monetary policy decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, according to which the tightening of the monetary policy by the NBG throughout 2015 has reflected positively on the decrease in inflation expectations. According to the current forecast the annual inflation will decrease in the coming quarters, temporarily keeping below the current target value. The inflation will reach the target value of 4% in the first half of 2017. The annual inflation in May dropped to 2.1%. This decrease in the annual inflation was largely due to the expiration of base effect and decrease in inflation expectations. The weak aggregate demand is another factor pushing the inflation down. Recently increased investment activity and partial improvement in the external demand have had positive effect on the economic growth. This trend is expected to continue in the coming periods as well. On the other hand increased interest rates on Lari-denominated loans and the overall weakening of the credit portfolio growth rates weakens the aggregate demand. According to the current forecast of the National Bank the economic growth in 2016 will stay below the potential level. Based on the aforementioned the Monetary Policy Committee considers necessary to continue phasing out the tight monetary policy, which means the reduction of the refinancing rate down to the neutral level in the medium-term. Therefore the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 50 basis points. The rate of further monetary policy softening will depend on the revised inflation forecasts and on the dynamics of economic recovery in general. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on July 27, 2016. *The inflation target is 5% in 2016, 4% in 2017 and 3% thereafter."
Peru,2016-06-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2016 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.25 percent. The Board has taken this decision considering that: Inflation expectations have continued to reverse gradually; The effects of the rise in the prices of some food products and utilities as well as the effects of the exchange rate on inflation have been reversing; Local economic activity has been showing a pace of growth close to its potential growth level, and The global economy continues showing mixed signals of recovery in terms of production and employment as well as lower volatility in financial markets. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to evaluate the convenience of making additional adjustments in the monetary policy rate. Inflation is expected to return to be within the target range before the end of the year. Inflation in May showed a rate of 0.2 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation fell from 3.9 percent in April to 3.5 percent in May. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.3 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 3.2 percent in April to 3.3 percent in May. Inflation expectations continue to decrease gradually and show a declining path from an expected rate of 3.4 percent in 2016 to an rate of 2.9 percent in 2017 and a rate of 2.5 percent in 2018. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for July at the Board meeting that will be held on July 14, 2016."
United States,2016-06-15,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indicates that the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed while growth in economic activity appears to have picked up. Although the unemployment rate has declined, job gains have diminished. Growth in household spending has strengthened. Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has continued to improve and the drag from net exports appears to have lessened, but business fixed investment has been soft. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley.

Chile,2016-06-16,"Santiago. Chile, 16 June 2016 Monetary Policy Meeting  June 2016 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3.5%. International financial markets remain volatile, very influenced by the upcoming referendum in the UK and the discussion around the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. Long-term interest rates have dropped in the main economies. Globally, stock markets are down and the prices of many commodities have risen. Copper has been an exception. The dollar, with ups and downs, is near where it was last month. The world growth outlook presents no significant changes. On the domestic front, in May's CPI variation was somewhat smaller than expected and y-o-y inflation remained at 4.2%. Expected inflation two years ahead remains at 3%. The evolution of these variables will continue to be monitored with special attention. Partial second-quarter output and demand data reflect limited growth. Confidence indicators are still in pessimistic territory, salaried employment is growing at a slow pace, the unemployment rate is still low and nominal wages have slowed. The Board estimates that, to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target, monetary policy will need to continue to normalize, at the pace that is implicit in the latest Monetary Policy Report's baseline scenario. Nonetheless, a significant deviation of inflation's convergence may change said pace. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2016-06-16,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release June 16, 2016 In its meeting held on June 16, 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation by 100 bps to 1175 percent, 1275 percent, and 1225 percent respectivel. The discount rate was also raised by 100 bps to 1225 percen. Headline year-on-year inflation rose to 1230 percent in May 2016 from 1027 percent in April, recording at 305 percent the highest monthly rate since July 201. In the meantime, core inflation rose to 1223 percent in May 2016 from 951 percent in April, recording at 315 percent the highest monthly rate since January 200. The monthly headline figure partly reflected regulated price adjustments which contributed by 04 percentage points, supply shocks such as the increase in rice prices which contributed by 05 percentage points, seasonal effects of the holy month of Ramadan, and a lagged pass-through effect from the March 14, 2016 exchange rate adjustmen. Output remained unfavorably impacted by domestic as well as external factor. Domestic demand, contributed 48 percentage points to the revised 45 percent real GDP growth in the first half of 2015/16, while net external demand contributed negative 03 percentage point. By sector, the services sector was the highest contributor to economic growth, particularly construction and real estate, while tourism contributed negativel. Furthermore growth continued to be supported by internal trade, agriculture and the general government sectors, whereas the industrial sector contributed negatively mainly due to continued weakness in the mining activity, but also due to the negative contribution of non- petroleum manufacturin. After evaluating the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook to date, the MPC judges that a rate hike is warranted to anchor inflation expectations over the medium-ter. The MPC reiterates its price stability mandate and will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, particularly fiscal policy and its effect on the inflation outloo. The MPC considers fiscal consolidation policies are necessary and will favorably contribute to macroeconomic stability and sustainable economic growth over the medium-ter.

Turkiye,2016-06-21,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 9.5 percent to 9 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 11 percent to 10.5 percent. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. While domestic demand continues to have a positive impact on growth, demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports. Accordingly economic activity displays a moderate and stable course of growth. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Recently, the global volatility has increased to some extent. The Committee assesses that the tight monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policies and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August 2015 increase the resilience of the economy against shocks. In this respect, the Committee decided to take a measured step towards simplification. Inflation has displayed a marked decline in recent months, mainly due to favorable course of unprocessed food prices and the improvement in the core inflation trend. However, the developments in services inflation and unit labor costs necessitate the maintenance of a tight liquidity stance. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Colombia,2016-06-22,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 7.50%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. Annual consumer inflation increased in May, reaching 8.2%. In contrast, the average of core inflation indicators lowered to 6.3%. Analysts' inflation expectations to one and two years posted at 4.4% and 3.7%, respectively, and those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years lowered within a range of 4.0% and 4.5%. Increases in food prices and the pass-through of nominal depreciation to consumer prices continue to exert inflationary pressures. Although these are temporary shocks, the intensity of El Nino and the magnitude of the depreciation of the peso have diverted inflation and inflation expectations from the target, and have activated some indexation mechanisms. The figures for global economic activity suggest a lower-than-expected dynamics of global output. It is likely that the average growth of Colombia's trading partners in 2016 be lower than the one observed in 2015. The expected pace of adjustment of monetary policy in the United States, international interest rates and country risk premia are lower today than at the beginning of the year. Oil prices remain at higher levels than forecast for the current year. Consequently, the country's terms of trade and national income could fall less than what was anticipated at the beginning of the year. Economic growth in the first quarter of 2016 (2.5%) was in line with the forecast by the technical staff from the Central Bank. Domestic demand slowed down less than expected, mainly due to a higher-than-expected dynamic of private consumption. Exports increased more, and imports fell less than forecast. With this information and new data of economic activity for the second quarter, the technical staff kept the growth forecast for 2016 between 1.5% and 3.2%, with 2.5% as the most likely figure. During the first quarter of 2016, the current account deficit was US$ 3,381 million (5.6% of GDP), a figure lower than forecast and than the quarterly values recorded since the beginning of 2014. This lower current account deficit reduces the country's vulnerability to adverse external shocks. In summary, the Colombian economy continues adjusting in an orderly manner to the strong shocks recorded since 2014. The current account deficit is correcting gradually, and the risk of an excessive deceleration of domestic demand remains moderate. Inflation has accelerated because of the depreciation of the peso. El Nino, and by the activation of some indexation mechanisms. In this context, the response of the monetary policy must acknowledge that the shocks that have influenced prices are transitory, while being oriented to ensure the convergence of inflation to the 3.0% target (=C2=B11 percentage point) in 2017. With this purpose, the Board deemed appropriate to increase the benchmark reference rate by 25 basis points. The adjustment of the monetary policy will continue contributing to the correction of the external deficit. The Board will continue to monitor the expected adjustment of expenditure and its consistency with the long-term income level, the sustainability of the external deficit, and, in general, macroeconomic stability. Similarly, it reaffirms its commitment to maintain inflation and its expectations anchored to the target, acknowledging that there has been a transitory increase in inflation. Bogot."
Philippines,2016-06-22,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 3.0 percent. The corresponding interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation environment continues to be manageable. Latest forecasts indicate that average inflation is likely to settle near the lower edge of the 3.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point target range in 2016 and rise toward the mid-point of the target range in 2017 and 2018. The overall balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook is now deemed to be broadly balanced. With global oil prices recovering, the risk of second-round effects from lower oil prices is likely to recede in the period ahead. Nevertheless, slower global economic activity remains a key downside risk to the inflation outlook. Given improved rainfall conditions and the shift to neutral weather conditions in the May-July period, the upside risks to food and utility prices due to El Niño are also seen to recede in the coming months. However, pending petitions for adjustments in electricity rates remain an upside risk to inflation. Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain broadly consistent with the inflation target over the policy horizon. At the same time, the Monetary Board also observed that prospects for global economic growth have remained subdued since the previous meeting, with increased downside risks to global activity. On the other hand, domestic economic activity continues to be firm, supported by solid private household consumption and investment, buoyant business and consumer sentiment, and adequate credit and domestic liquidity. Higher fiscal spending is also expected to further boost domestic demand. On balance, therefore, the sum of recent new information, particularly on the emerging outlook for inflation and demand conditions, continues to support keeping monetary policy unchanged. At the same time, the continued uncertainty relating to monetary policy prospects in major advanced economies requires a steady hand on policy settings in order to retain flexibility in the period ahead."
Thailand,2016-06-22,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 22 June 2016 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 22 June 2016 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. One MPC member was unable to attend this meeting. In deliberating monetary policy, the Committee judged that the economy would continue to recover, and inflation would return to the target band within the latter half of the year as previously expected. Meanwhile monetary conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery. Hence the policy rate should be kept on hold at this meeting. The Thai economy continued to recover on the back of public expenditure and broad-based improvement in the tourism sector, while private consumption expanded as anticipated. However expansion in private investment remained low, and merchandise exports still contracted in tandem with other Asian economies which were weaker than expected. Overall the economic momentum from domestic demand and the tourism sector offset the impact from contraction in merchandise exports. As such, the economy was expected to expand at the same rate as previously assessed. Nevertheless there are remaining downside risks from slower-than-expected growth of trading partners, and private sector's confidence which is still fragile. However concerns pertaining to the impact of the drought have subsided, and prices of some agricultural commodities have shown sign of recovery. Inflationary pressure edged up with the ongoing economic recovery. Headline inflation in May picked up further with the acceleration in energy and fresh food prices, while core inflation increased slightly. The Committee assessed that headline inflation would gradually rise and return to the target band within the latter half of this year. Monetary conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery as reflected in low real interest rates. Total corporate financing and household credits continued to expand, although certain business sectors faced limitations in obtaining credits. Meanwhile financial stability risks from the prolonged low interest rate environment, including search-for-yield behavior, continued to warrant close monitoring. The Committee saw merit in preserving policy space given that the Thai economy would still be facing risks going forward, such as the fragile global economic recovery, monetary policy divergence among major advanced economies, the result of the EU Referendum in the UK (‘Brexit') and financial stability concerns in China. Going forward, the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative, and stands ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to ensure that monetary conditions are conducive to the economic recovery, while ensuring financial stability."
Ukraine,2016-06-23,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the key policy rate to 16.5%, effective 24 June 2016. Further easing of monetary policy fully complies with inflation target for 2016 and 2017 and takes place under conditions of steady inflationary pressure reduction, improved inflation expectations and stable foreign exchange market situation. In May 2016, headline inflation dropped to 7.5% y-o-y, which was consistent with the NBU's projections. Inflationary pressure reduction was of a fundamental nature confirming core inflation slowdown. That was favored by prudent monetary policy and strengthening of hryvnia exchange rate due to favorable world commodity markets situation. In addition, increase of foods supply supported the disinflationary trend. Domestic demand remains moderate and does not put additional pressure on prices. Thus, in Q1 while recovery of the economic growth y-o-y, as expected, households consumption still remained lower than in the previous year (by 2.2%). According to the NBU estimates, economic growth accelerated in Q2 due to external and investment demand. That was favored by improved global commodities markets situation and better enterprise expectations against the background of internal political stabilization and agreement with the International Monetary Fund at expert level regarding second review of Extended Fund Facility Arrangement. Favorable foreign economic conditions resulted in increased export earnings and improved foreign exchange market situation. Under these conditions, the NBU using a flexible exchange rate purchased foreign currency to replenish international reserves leaving an opportunity for moderate exchange rate strengthening caused by fundamental factors. In addition, normalization of foreign exchange market situation allowed the NBU to proceed with gradual liberalization of administrative limits. Gradual exchange rate strengthening along with sustained inflation slowdown caused significant decrease in inflation expectations of households and business increasing control over prices in future. Therefore, the NBU considers headline inflation targets at level of 12%+/-3 p.p. to be attainable by the end of 2016 and 8%+/-2 p.p. by the end of 2017. In the second half of this year, the NBU expects inflation to get closer to target level y-o-y due to reflection of higher tariffs for public utilities in statistics. That was already provided by the NBU projections and will not require monetary policy responses. As before, domestic demand pressure on headline inflation is expected to be insignificant. Improved prospects for grain and other agricultural crops due to favorable weather conditions are among factors supporting moderate price dynamics. Global commodities markets situation will influence the foreign exchange market. Dividend repatriation, which started on 13 June 2016, will not have significant destabilizing influence, as under provided scheduled payments the supply on the foreign exchange market will be sufficient to meet these needs, according to the NBU estimates. Completion of the second programme review under the Extended Arrangement remains a key factor for achievement of price stability over the medium term. Thus, government commitment to continue current reforms and their support of the Verkhovna Rada are important. The NBU will proceed with monetary policy easing to support the recovery of economic activity when it is not in conflict with achievement of inflation targets. Gradual and moderate easing of monetary conditions will be an economy incentive and, at the same time, it will secure inflation from domestic demand pressure. Lower interest rates will raise demand for loans. The decision to cut the key policy rate to 16.5% is approved by NBU Board Decision No. 88-рш, dated 23 June 2016. On Key Policy Rate. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held as scheduled on 28 July 2016."
Israel,2016-06-27,"Currency (Unit) Rate Daily Change. Nominal Effective Rate -0.085%. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor May increased by 0.3 percent, a slightly higher increase than the average of forecasters' predictions for an increase of 0.2 percent. There was a significant increase (4.4 percent) in the vegetables and fruit component, and there was an increase in the miscellaneous component (0.9 percent). There was no significant decline in any of the components. The inflation rate as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was -0.8 percent, compared with -0.9 percent in the 12 months ending in April. Excluding the direct effect of energy prices and administrative price reductions, inflation over the past 12 months was 0.5 percent. Prices of components representing tradable goods in the CPI declined by 3.2 percent over the past 12 months, and the prices of components representingnontradable items increased by 0.5 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: There was a slight increase in one-year inflation expectations this month, against the background of the increase in oil prices, the depreciation of the shekel, increases in wages, and continued growth of private consumption.<span> Expectations derived from the capital market increased to 0.4 percent (compared with 0.3 percent in the previous month). Expectations for inflation over the coming 12 months derived from banks' internal interest rates increased to 0.3 percent (compared with 0.25 percent last month), and private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPIreadings are for an increase of 0.8 percent, on average, (compared with 0.7 percent in the previous month). Medium-term and long-term forward expectations remained stable, except for a decline of 0.2 percentage points in third-year forward expectations, to 1.1 percent. Longer term expectations remained within the target range with medium-term (3-5 years) expectations at 1.3 percent, and long-term (5 C2 AD-10 years) expectations at 2.2 percent. The makam curve and the Telbor curve remained unchanged, and do not indicate any change expected in the Bank of Israel interest rate in the next year. According to the average of projections by private forecasters, the Bank of Israel interest rate is expected to remain at its current level in the coming months. Real economic activity: The second estimate of National Accounts data for the first quarter indicates growth of 1.3 percent (compared with 0.8 percent in the first estimate) in GDP, and of 0.2 percent (compared with a decline of 0.4 percent) in business product (seasonally adjusted data in annual terms). Indicators of real economic activity that became available this month point to an apparentreturn of the growth rate to the levels that characterized it in recent years. This assessment is supported, inter alia, by partial data from the Companies Survey for the second quarter, which indicate some increase in the net balance relative to the first quarter. According to export data, goods exports (excluding ships and aircraft and diamonds) in April-May were about 4 percent lower than the average for the first quarter. The decline in exports is concentrated in four industries that were affected by factors, some of which are not expected to persist: electronic components, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and vehicles: which together comprise about half of goodsexports. The remaining exports increased by 4.7 percent during the same period. Business services exports (excluding startups) were 3 percent higher in April than the average for the first quarter. There was a surplus of $3.3 billion (seasonally adjusted) recorded in the Current Account of the Balance of Payments, similar to the average in the past two years. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.1 percent in May, led by an increase in the consumer goods imports and in the import of manufacturing inputs. Previous indexreadings were revised downward. The Consumer Confidence Indices compiled by Bank Hapoalim and by the Central Bureau of Statistics declined in May, but remained higher than the average of the last year. The Purchasing Managers Index declined slightly in May, to 49.4 points. The labor market: The picture conveyed by the labor market remains positive. Labor Force Survey data for May indicates that the unemployment rate among the prime working ages (25-64)declined to 4.1 percent, compared with 4.3 percent in April. There was a slight increase in the employment rate (to 77.1 percent, from 77.0 percent in April), and stability the participation rate (80.4 percent). The increasein wages across the economy continued. Real wages increased by 1.5 percent (seasonally adjusted) in January-March, compared with the three previous months, while nominal wages increased by 1.3 percent. Health tax receipts for March-May were 5.7 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period in the year before, reflecting the increase in employment and wages. The job vacancy rate was a record 3.8 percent (seasonally adjusted) in May. Stability in the number of employee posts in recent months may be a result of the transition of workers from part-time to full-time positions. Budget data: The cumulative domestic surplus (excluding net credit) in government activity was NIS 2.3 billion in January-May 2016, compared with a surplus of approximately NIS 2.8 billion in the corresponding period of 2015, and it is about NIS 3.5 billionhigher than the seasonal path consistent with achieving the deficit targetfor 2016. The deviation reflects revenues that were NIS 1.7 billion higherthan the path, and expenditures that were NIS 1.8 billion lower than the path. Tax revenues in May were NIS 26.4 billion, which is about NIS 2 billion higher than the seasonal path consistent with the estimate of tax revenue. Tax revenues in January-May were about 6.4 percent higher in realterms than in the corresponding period of the previous year. Gross domestic VAT collection increased by about 7.2 percent in real terms compared withMay of 2015 (about 13.1 percent net of the effect of legislative changes). Staff forecast: This month, the ResearchDepartment updated its macroeconomic forecast, which reflects an initial assessment, relying on estimates by the International Monetary Fund, of the implications of the Brexit for the global economy. The notice of the forecast is being published in parallel with this release. Compared with the previous quarterly forecast, the current forecast reflects a similar assessmentregarding the development of inflation, and more moderate assessments of the growth rate and the interest rate. The inflation rate is expected to be 1.0 percent over the coming four quarters and is expected to return to within the target range toward the middle of 2017. The Bank of Israel interest rate is expected to remain at 0.1 percent during the coming year, and to increase to 0.25 percent toward the end of 2017. GDP is expected to grow by 2.4 percent in 2016 (compared with 2.8 percent in the previous forecast due to the low growth in the first quarter) and by 2.9 percent in 2017 (compared with 3.0 percent in the previous forecast). The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on May 22, 2016, through June 24, 2016, the shekelweakened by 0.4 percent against the dollar, and remained virtually unchanged in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate: appreciation of 0.1 percent. On the trading day following the referendum in Britain, there was no significant change in the effective exchange rate, despite volatility in the cross rates. Over the preceding 12 months, the shekel appreciated by 0.1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on May 22, 2016, through June 23, 2016, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 0.4 percent. Government bond yields declined slightly along the nominal curve, and increased slightly along the indexed curve. The makam curve traded at a yield ranging around the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, increased to 85 basis points. The response of the Israeli capital market to the referendum in Britain was moderate relative to abroad. On June 25, the first trading day in Israel following the referendum, the Tel Aviv 25 index declinedby 3.2 percent, and the yields on government bonds declined by 10 basis points. The money supply: In the 12 months ending in May, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 25 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 11.3 percent. The credit market: In May, the business sector (excluding banks and insurance companies) issued bonds totaling NIS 2.3 billion, after issuances totaled NIS 5.1 billion in April. The average of monthly issuances in the past year is about NIS 2.6 billion. The volume of mutual fund withdrawals remained high in May, totaling NIS 1.5 billion. In contrast, funds specializing in corporate bonds and in equities in Israel continued to attract net new investment. Corporate bond spreads continuedto decline in most industries, and were about 3.4 percentage points, on average (excluding bonds of financial corporations). In May, the total volumeof new mortgages taken out was NIS 5.3 billion, similar to the average of the past 12 months, even though May is typically characterized by a high level of new mortgages taken out. The rate of mortgages issued for the purchase of investment homes was 13.5 percent in May, compared to an average of 15 percent in the past 12 months. The interest rate on mortgages in the variable-rate unindexed track, the variable-rate CPI-indexed track and the fixed-rate unindexed track increased by 0.01-0.04 percentage points, while the interest rate on the fixed-rate CPI-indexed track declined by 0.07 percentage points. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) remained unchanged in May, after increasing by 0.2 percent in April. The rate of home prices increases remains high. Home prices increased by 1.2 percent in March-April, and by 7.8 percent in the 12 months ending in April, compared with 7.2 percent in the 12 months ending in March. Activity in the market remains robust, with 7,700 transactions carried out in April, slightly lower than the annual average of 8,100 transactions per months. The volume of new-home sales was about 2,600 in April, similar to the monthly average over the past year. Thestock of new homes available for sale increased in April to approximately 27,400 homes, the highest level since the end of 2014. During the past year, there has been an apparent decline in the number of building starts and the duration of construction has become longer. However, the annual rate of building starts remains high: about 47,000 in the past four quarters. The global economy: The results of the referendum in the UK surprised the financial markets, and led to a high level of volatility. At the end of the first trading day following the referendum, the pound sterling had weakened by 7.6 percent against the US dollar and the euro weakened by 2.1 percent against the dollar, while the Japanese yen strengthened by 3.4 percent against the dollar. Shareindices declined by up to about 13 percent (with sharp declines in bank shares), and yields on 10-year government bonds declined by up to about 30 basis points. At this stage, it is too early to assess whether the volatilitywill continue in the coming days. According to International Monetary Fund assessments published prior to the referendum, the effect of Britain leaving the EU is expected to result in a negative impact of 0.1-0.3 percent of global GDP. Data that became available this month continue to indicate a continuation of the moderation in the global economy, a trendthat was focused mainly on the emerging markets. Indices of global economic activity indicated moderate growth of the services sector and a lack of growth in the manufacturing sector, as well as continued very moderate growth of world trade. The uncertainty due to the referendum in the UK led to a sharp decline in yields on government bonds considered 'safe', some of which declined to historic lows. ; In the US, the number of new jobs added was particularly low: about 38,000 positions: contributing to the Federal Reserve's decision to leave the interest rate unchanged, and to a decline in thepath of the expected interest rate based on forecasts by members of the FOMC. Weakness in the manufacturing sector continues, but private consumptioncontinues to support growth. According to the GDPNow index, growth in the second quarter is expected to be 2.6 percent. ; Inflation remains low, but the core indices are close to 2 percent. In Europe, the estimate of first quarter growth was revised downward (0.6 percent quarterly), and macroeconomic data published during the month indicated lower growth in the second quarter. The unemployment rate remained stable at a high rate of 10.2 percent.<span> Inflation remains negative, and core inflation is also far from the target. In Japan, weakness in economic activity continued, which led the government to delay the planned VAT increase.<span> There, too, inflation is negative and core inflation is low. In China, economic activity continued to grow at a relatively moderate rate. The price of a barrel of oil ranged around $50 this month, and the index of commodities excluding energy increased by about 2 percent. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for July 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. Uncertainty regarding the implications of the Brexit, and the continued decline of exports in recent months, strengthen the Monetary Committee's assessment that in view of developments in the inflation environment, in growth in Israel and in the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. C 2B 7 In thepast two months the Consumer Price Index increased, and there was a slightincrease this month in one-year inflation expectations from various sources. The rapid increase in wages and continued increase inprivate consumption will support the return of inflation to within the target range within about a year, according to the Research Department's staff forecast. Medium and long-term expectations remain anchored within the target range. C 2B 7 The second estimate of National Accounts data for the first quarter also shows that growth was low, but the Research Department's assessment shows that the economy has returned to the level of growth that characterized it the past few years. The decline in exports is concentrated in a number of industries that were affected by factors,some of which are not expected to persist, and private consumption continues to lead growth, supported by the low interest rate and the increase in wages. The picture emerging from the labor market remainspositive, and there are signs that the economy is nearing full employment. C 2B 7 The results of the referendum in Britain were a surprise, and the global financial markets reacted sharply. At this stage it is too earlyto assess whether the short-term effect on the financial markets has run its course. In the coming months, uncertainty is expectedregarding the implications of the Brexit process for the global economy. The monetary policy of the major central banks is expected to remain very accommodative. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on May 22, 2016, through June 24, 2016, the shekelweakened by 0.4 percent against the dollar, and the effective exchange rate remained virtually unchanged: appreciation of 0.1 percent. Looking at the past year, the effective exchange rate stabilized, but its level continues to pose difficulties for the growth of exports and of the tradable sector. C 2B 7 The pace of home price increases remains high, and both the level of transactions and the volume of mortgages remain high. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that, in view of the uncertainty generated due to the Brexit, the risks to achieving the inflation target and to growth have increased. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keepa close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for July 2016 will be published on July 11, 2016. The decision regarding the interest rate for August 2016 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. July 25, 2016."
Armenia,2016-06-28,"Press Release 28.06.2016 At the June 28, 2016 meeting, the Board of the CBA decided to cut the Refinancing Rate by 0.25 pp, setting it at 7.5%. Deflation in May of 2016 was 0.7% compared to 0.5% recorded in the same month of the previous year, under which circumstance the 12-month inflation rate reached -2.1% at the end of the month. In the external sector a slow pace of global economic growth, as well as relative stability achieved recently in international commodity markets were generally maintained. However, certain inflationary trends were observable in respect of some commodities. The CBA Board estimates that significant inflationary effects from the external sector are not likely in the upcoming months. Meanwhile, the CBA keeps on watching and monitoring financial markets' performance in the light of processes in the European Union. The CBA Board notes that relatively high economic activity was further observable in Armenia in January-May against the same reference period of the previous year, which was concomitant with some recovery in aggregate demand. Although domestic demand is still weak, it is bouncing back at a faster-than-expected rate as a result of recent expansionary policy implementation by the CBA and the Government, which clearly points to the growth recorded in trade sector, import of goods, and economy lending. The CBA Board estimates that inflation environment will remain low in the upcoming months and inflation expectations will be relatively stable. However, deflation will slow down considerably in the second half of the year. In that situation, the Board considers it reasonable to reduce the refinancing rate under which circumstance the deflationary environment will phase out gradually and the 12-month inflation rate will return to its target in the forecast horizon. Later, as economic developments unfold, the CBA will steer its monetary policy directions accordingly while fulfilling the inflation target in the medium run. More information on setting of the interest rate will be available in the Interest Rate Minutes to be released on July 8, 2016. Press Service of the Central Bank."
India,2016-06-28,"Summary of the Electronic Consultation with the Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy: May 2016 Consultation with external Members of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Monetary Policy was held electronically during May 24-30, 2016 in the run up to the Second Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Review, 2016-17 on June 7, 2016. The main points made by Members are summarised below. Members noted that the global economic recovery is struggling to gain momentum. While strong decelerating forces persist in inhibiting growth in key emerging market economies (EMEs), growth in some key advanced economies (AEs) has moderated, clouding global economic prospects in the near term. Deflation fears remain on account of subdued global trade, weak growth prospects in EMEs and still low commodity prices. Monetary policy stances are set to diverge further in AEs, which could unsettle financial markets. The recent rise in international crude oil prices poses inflation risks to oil importing countries. On domestic economic growth, the sustained weakness of industrial production continues to be a source of concern, and a drag on overall activity. Low capacity utilization numbers suggest that some sectors of the economy are operating below potential. There are also clear and continuing signs of a demand shortfall facing industry, which also continues to battle low global demand. Corporate sector activity may be improving as reflected in the Reserve Bank's recent release of corporate results, with double digit growth in earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation (EBIDTA). Since the wholesale price index has moved up, there is likely to be some deceleration in the growth of value added in the industrial sector, although not of the magnitude reflected in the index of industrial production (IIP). Real growth in the services sector may continue to be robust despite a higher deflator, because of the increase in some nominal indicators, such as financial sector activity. Agriculture growth may surprise positively if the monsoon is good. In sum, while the economy has revived somewhat, and is likely to see a cyclical recovery if a good monsoon sets in, the latest IIP numbers have added to pressure that more needs to be done to put the economy on a trajectory of higher growth. Most of the Members expressed concern on the inflation outlook since food inflation rose by 100 basis points, headline inflation moved up by 60 basis points, and even excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel, inflation edged up marginally and remained sticky in April. There are also upside risks to inflation associated with a rebound in crude prices. Further upside risks to inflation could arise from the implementation of the Seventh Central Pay Commission and one-2 rank-one-pension recommendations, as also from adverse supply shocks (poor monsoon with consequences for cereal inflation, in particular). On the external sector, favourable terms of trade continue to be weighed down by feeble global demand, resulting in a low current account deficit. In the US, there is growing evidence of wage pressures. If the Fed Funds rate rises, there may be another bout of financial turmoil and there may be net capital outflows from EMEs, as in January-February of 2016. For the second bi-monthly monetary policy, three of the five Members recommended no change in the policy rate. Before contemplating any easing of policy rate, these Members wanted to see substantially lower inflation relative to the 2016-17 target of 5 per cent on a durable basis; assess the effect of the monsoon in the next couple of months; get further clarity on the Fed's take on the Federal Funds Rate. Two Members recommended a policy repo rate reduction by 25 basis points. According to them, the shortfall of demand in the economy calls for some stimulus, since the natural rate falls in such conditions; the stimulus will be consistent with flexible inflation targeting and anchoring of inflation expectation; the effect of the predicted good monsoon would keep food prices under check; there is a window of opportunity before a possible Fed rate hike in mid-June. One of these two Members was of the view that, given the fragmentation and incompleteness of India's financial markets, the repo rate has proved to be a much less effective instrument of monetary policy than in well developed markets like in the US. Therefore, the Reserve Bank must ensure that there is ample liquidity and that reserve money expands by 12-14 per cent if the effects of previous repo rate changes are to be transmitted to the markets. The Reserve Bank should also be prepared to make forex available to importers, if debt outflows follow a possible Fed rate hike in June. All the five external Members  Dr.Shankar Acharya. Dr.Arvind Virmani. Prof. Errol D'Souza. Prof. Ashima Goyal, and Prof. Chetan Ghate  sent their feedback through e-mail. Since February 2011, the Reserve Bank has been placing the main points of discussions of the TAC on Monetary Policy in the public domain with a lag of roughly four weeks after the meeting/consultation.

Czech Republic,2016-06-30,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the CNB still stands ready to intervene automatically, i.e. without the need for an additional decision of the Bank Board, and without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is based on the message of the current forecast and on an assessment of newly available information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the koruna exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until mid-2017. Inflation is still well below the CNB's target of 2%. In line with the forecast, inflation has declined temporarily close to zero. This reflects the fact that domestic inflation is still being affected by strong anti-inflationary effects from abroad. Monetary policy looks past the first-round effects of such factors and focuses on any adverse second-round effects. Inflation will remain close to zero in 2016 Q3. However, it will then increase, hitting the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon. According to the current forecast, sustainable fulfilment of the target, which is a condition for a return to conventional monetary policy, will occur from mid-2017. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the current forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being slightly anti-inflationary. A need to maintain expansionary monetary conditions at least to the current extent persists. The Bank Board therefore states again that the CNB will not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017. The Bank Board still considers it likely that the commitment will be discontinued in mid-2017. The CNB continues to stand ready to shift the exchange rate commitment to a weaker level if there were to be a systematic decrease in inflation expectations manifesting itself in nominal variables, especially wages. At the same time, the Bank Board stated again that any exchange rate appreciation following the discontinuation of the exchange rate commitment would be dampened, among other things, by hedging of exchange rate risk by exporters during the existence of the commitment, by the closing of koruna positions by financial investors and by possible CNB interventions to mitigate exchange rate volatility. In line with the forecast, annual headline inflation fell to 0.1% in May. The individual components of inflation also developed as expected. The increase in consumer prices was due solely to adjusted inflation excluding fuels, reflecting growth in the domestic economy and wages. By contrast, the contributions of all other components of inflation were negative, owing to anti-inflationary cost effects mainly from abroad. Administered prices started to decline year on year as a result of lower prices of natural gas for households, and food prices also returned to a year-on-year decrease. As expected, annual growth in the Czech economy slowed in 2016 Q1. However, the growth rate of 3% was slightly higher than forecasted. In line with the forecast, the slowdown in economic growth was due to a marked fall in the contribution of fixed investment as a result of an only gradual start to the drawdown of EU funds in the new programme period. The slightly stronger increase in economic activity compared to the forecast was aided by a higher contribution of inventories and household consumption, which was only partly offset by a lower contribution of net exports. Information on economic developments abroad obtained from the June Consensus Forecasts suggests that economic activity in the effective euro area will continue to rise at a relatively stable pace of around 2%, still supported by easy monetary conditions and low oil prices. The forecast for euro area producer prices was revised downwards for this year, so the unwinding of their decline shifted to the beginning of next year. The consumer price inflation outlook for this year was also lowered marginally. The market outlook for the 3M Euribor was virtually unchanged. Foreign interest rates will thus remain slightly negative over the entire forecast horizon. The mid-June market outlook for Brent crude oil prices increased amid rising demand on account of previous unexpected extraction shortfalls, up by around USD 5 a barrel over the entire horizon. Only two weeks ago. Brent crude oil prices were thus expected to rise to USD 55 a barrel by the end of next year. At the same time, the June outlook for the euro-dollar exchange rate shifted towards a slightly stronger euro owing to expectations of a more gradual monetary policy tightening in the USA. However, the result of the referendum on the exit of the UK from the EU then caused a depreciation of the euro against the dollar. The continuing domestic economic growth is fostering a further improvement in the Czech labour market situation. Growth in both total employment and the number of employees picked up pace in 2016 Q1, standing above the current forecast. Ongoing growth in labour demand was reflected in a further drop in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate. The seasonally adjusted share of unemployed persons also continued to decrease. Annual wage growth in the business sector accelerated to 4.5%, and was therefore slightly above the forecast. Wage growth in the non-business sector was also slightly higher than forecasted. The wage median increased at a faster year-on-year pace than the average wage, reflecting strong wage growth mainly for lower-income employees. Indicators from the real economy point to continued economic growth in 2016 Q2. Growth in retail sales remains strong. Industrial production is still rising moderately, while the year-on-year decline in construction output has been deepening gradually since January 2016. This is in line with the downturn in government sector investment activity this year in connection with the EU funds drawdown cycle. The year-on-year decrease in prices in manufacturing and agricultural producer prices has deepened further so far in 2016, reflecting above all anti-inflationary cost effects from abroad. Prices of market services were broadly flat year on year, whereas construction work prices continued to rise moderately. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy, both GDP and the average wage increased slightly faster in 2016 Q1 than forecasted. By contrast, inflation in May and unemployment so far in Q2 were in line with the CNB's forecast. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being slightly anti-inflationary. The risk of more subdued industrial producer prices in the euro area persists. The same is true for the risk of long-standing low inflation passing through to inflation expectations and wage developments. However, the fact that wage growth was slightly above the current forecast in 2016 Q1 is an inflationary risk. The result of the referendum in the UK, which implies its likely future exit from the EU, is a new uncertainty. The reactions of the financial and commodity markets and negative impacts on economic sentiment in Europe, the strength of which is difficult to predict, will mainly play a role in the shorter term. In the context of the slightly anti-inflationary balance of risks to the current forecast, the Bank Board points out that the CNB stands ready to shift the exchange rate commitment to a weaker level if there were to be a systematic decrease in inflation expectations manifesting itself in nominal variables, especially wages. At the same time, the Bank Board states again that the CNB will not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017. The Bank Board still considers it likely that the commitment will be discontinued in mid-2017, i.e. in line with the assumption of the current forecast."
Romania,2016-06-30," Video: Press briefing, 30 June 2016 (Romanian only). In its meeting of 30 June 2016, the Board of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) decided the following:. The NBR is closely monitoring external and domestic developments and stands ready to use all its available tools during this period of heightened uncertainty in a bid to fulfil the overriding objective regarding medium-term price stability and to preserve financial stability. The most recent macroeconomic developments show the annual inflation rate remaining in negative territory, along with economic growth picking up, solely on the back of stronger domestic demand. Following the cut in the standard VAT rate from 24 percent to 20 percent and the drop in global food and energy prices, the annual inflation rate moved in line with expectations, declining to -3.5 percent in May 2016 from -0.93 percent at end-2015. The average annual CPI inflation rate stood at -2.1 percent in May 2016, while the average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is relevant for assessing convergence with the European Union, came in at -1.7 percent. Annual GDP growth gathered momentum, reaching 4.3 percent in 2016 Q1, compared with 3.8 percent in the previous three-month period. The rapid increase in final consumption of households, amid their higher income and the extended fiscal stimulus action, caused GDP dynamics to hit a post-crisis high, together with a sharp rise in imports. The fast-paced import growth led to the trade balance worsening, which, alongside a relative contraction in inflows from EU funds, had a bearing on the current account. This development was partly countered by the wider surplus on trade in services. On the supply side, the key determinant of the pick-up in economic growth was the gross value added in the services sector, which came to account for an unprecedented 60 percent of GDP. The most recent data and business surveys point to an ongoing expansion of consumer demand and elevated unit labour costs in industry. Real monetary conditions have remained stimulative. Monetisation of the economy gained ground and credit to the private sector saw its upward trend strengthening, driven by the dynamics of leu-denominated loans. In May 2016, loans in domestic currency climbed to 54 percent of the stock of private sector loans, the highest share since 1997. This development confirms the improvement in the monetary policy transmission, helping mitigate the risks to financial stability as well. The heightened volatility on global financial markets in the context of the UK referendum had a bearing also on the local market, but the exchange rate of the leu recorded lower movements than those of its regional peers. International reserves remain adequate and Romania's external position is sustainable. Together with a currently stable macroeconomic environment, they ensure a proper resilience of the domestic economy to adverse external shocks. Short-term forecasts point to the annual inflation rate staying in negative territory, albeit at considerably less negative readings due to the fading out of the direct impact of broadening, in June 2015, the scope of the reduced VAT rate to all food items. The prospects for the inflation rate to gradually return into positive territory are surrounded by both domestic and external risks, amid heightened uncertainty. Specifically, the external environment is marked by persistently low inflation, as well as by the escalating uncertainty about global economic growth, the UK's status in relation to the European Union, and about the monetary policy stances of the world's major central banks, given the higher volatility on international financial markets. On the domestic front, risks stem from the fiscal and income policy stance, as well as from the adverse effects generated by legislative changes in the financial and banking areas. Based on currently available data and in the context of heightened uncertainty, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum and to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system. Moreover, the NBR Board has decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The prudent monetary policy stance and the adequate dosage of the monetary policy instruments, along with the precautionary measures in the area of prudential supervision of the banking sector, are likely to strengthen the Romanian economy's capacity to withstand shocks. However, the consolidation of the economic picture calls for a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and for progress in structural reforms. The NBR is closely monitoring external and domestic developments and stands ready to use all its available tools during this period of heightened uncertainty. In its capacity as member of the European System of Central Banks, the NBR is in close contact with other central banks. The NBR reiterates that it will permanently act towards fulfilling the overriding objective of ensuring medium-term price stability and safeguarding financial stability. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 4 August 2016, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Poland,2016-07-06,"Warsaw, 6 July 2016 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 5-6 July 2016 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate 1.50%;  lombard rate 2.50%;  deposit rate 0.50%;  rediscount rate 1.75%. Global economic growth remains moderate. At the same time, uncertainty remains about future economic conditions in the global economy, associated additionally with the implications of the referendum on the United Kingdom's membership in the European Union. The result of the referendum has increased risk aversion in the global financial markets, which was reflected in a depreciation of currencies and a decline in asset prices in many countries. A modest recovery continues in the euro area, despite the negative impact of weak economic conditions in developing countries. The expected slowdown in growth in the United Kingdom is a risk factor for economic conditions in the euro area. In the United States economic growth remains moderate. However, weaker data from the labour market impedes clear assessment of future economic conditions in the US. In China the economic growth has probably decelerated further, while Russia and Brazil remain in a recession. Despite some increase in recent months, prices of oil and many other commodities in the global markets remain markedly lower than in the previous years. This development  combined with moderate global economic activity  is the main driver behind very low consumer price growth in a number of economies. The European Central Bank is keeping its interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and continues financial asset purchases. In the United States, data from financial markets suggests a delay of further interest rate increases. At the same time, uncertainty about further decisions of the Federal Reserve has increased. In Poland, incoming data shows that economic activity has accelerated after a GDP slowdown in 2016 Q1. A relatively strong increase in the wage bill and favourable consumer sentiment as well as a sound financial position of enterprises and their high capacity utilisation have a positive influence on domestic economic conditions. This is accompanied by a stable growth of credit to the non-financial sector. An increase in disposal income of households resulting from the ""Family 500+"" programme will contribute to GDP growth in the coming quarters. Yet, the uncertainty about economic 1/2 conditions abroad, including the effects of the UK referendum, is a risk factor for domestic economic activity. With negative output gap and a moderate growth of average nominal wages, currently there is no inflationary pressure in the economy. Annual consumer price growth and producer price growth remain negative. External factors  particularly the earlier sharp fall in the global commodity prices and the low price growth in the environment of the Polish economy  continue to be the main sources of deflation. This is accompanied by low inflation expectations. The persisting deflation has not adversely affected decisions taken by economic agents so far. The Council became acquainted with the projections of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute, which is one of the inputs to the Council's decisions on the NBP interest rates. In line with the July projection based on the NECMOD model  prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until the projection cut-off date of 24 June 2016  there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of -0.9 ÷ -0.3% in 2016 (compared to -0.9 ÷ 0.2% in the March 2016 projection), 0.3  2.2% in 2017 (compared to 0.2  2.3%) and 0.3  2.6% in 2018 (compared to 0.4  2.8%). In turn, the annual GDP growth rate  in line with this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 2.6  3.8% in 2016 (compared to 3.0  4.5% in the March 2016 projection), 2.4  4.5% in 2017 (compared to 2.6  4.8%) and 2.1  4.3% in 2018 (compared to 2.1  4.4%). In the Council's assessment, the CPI growth will remain negative in the coming quarters due to the earlier substantial decline in the global commodity prices. At the same time. GDP growth is expected to remain stable in the coming quarters, following a temporary deceleration at the beginning of the year. Consumer demand will continue to be the main driver of economic growth, supported by rising employment, the forecasted acceleration of wage growth and an increase in social benefits. This notwithstanding, the downside risks to the global economic conditions, aggravated by the uncertainty about the effects of the UK's EU referendum, and the volatility of commodity prices, remain the sources of uncertainty for the economy and the price developments. The Council confirms its assessment that  given the available data and forecasts  the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance. The Council adopted Inflation Report  July 2016."
Kazakhstan,2016-07-11,"PRESS - RELEASE 17 On the base rate July 11, 2016 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to lower the base rate to 13.0% with a band of +/- 1%. Inflation is fully corresponds to the forecasts of the National Bank, and the risks of acceleration of the inflation under current conditions are minimal, which with a high probability allows expecting inflation to achieve the upper limit of the 6-8% inflation target band by the end of 2016. Taking into account the time lag effect of the base rate on inflation, which is estimated to take up to one year, the decision to reduce the base rate confirms the confidence that inflation will remain within the target band over the horizon of twelve months and up until the end of 2017. This decision on the base rate was taken in light of the following factors. Positive trends of the last four months in the global market contribute to conversion from foreign currency denominated assets to assets in tenge both in the foreign exchange cash market and also in the bank deposit market. In May  June 2016 prices in the world oil markets were formed at higher than expected levels. Results of the referendum on the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union have led to an increase in short-term turbulence in the financial markets, but the direct risks of Brexit on Kazakhstan are estimated to be limited. The situation in the domestic market is stable, the negative expectations regarding currency risks are reduced. According to the estimates of the National Bank, the exchange rate of tenge reflects a combination of fundamental external and internal factors that is evidenced by minor changes of the rate over the past months and the level of participation of the National Bank in the domestic foreign exchange market. A structural liquidity surplus is observed in the money market, therefore the National Bank continues to actively conduct operations on absorbing excess liquidity. Low credit activity and demand for credit resources do not allow the liquidity to flow into the real economy, thus limiting the risk of accelerating inflation. The value of actual inflation coincides with the estimates of the National Bank. During the first half of 2016 it equaled 4.6%, in June  0.4%. According to NBK's inflation expectation survey and the monitoring of enterprises, a more moderate rate of growth of prices for consumer goods and final products of the real sector enterprises is expected. Inflation in countries - main trading partners is slowing down. Preservation of low level of economic activity in the country remains to be a limiting factor. Further actions on the base rate will depend on the actual inflation, its deviation from the forecast, inflation expectations of population and market participants and currency preferences of economic agents. Possible reduction of the base rate would be determined by the presence of sustained signal indicating the convergence of inflation to the target range. Next decision on the base rate will be announced on August 15th, 2016 at 17:00 Astana time.

Malaysia,2016-07-13,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) to 3.00 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 3.25 percent and 2.75 percent respectively. The global economy continues to record growth at a more moderate pace, across major advanced and emerging market economies. In Asia, persistent weakness in the external sector has weighed on growth, although domestic demand remains supportive. Looking ahead, there are increasing signs of moderating growth momentum in the major economies. Global growth prospects have also become more susceptible to increased downside risks in light of possible repercussions from the EU referendum in the United Kingdom. International financial markets could also be subject to greater volatility going forward. In this light, global monetary conditions are expected to remain highly accommodative. For Malaysia, domestic demand continues to be the main driver of growth. Private consumption will be supported by growth in income and employment, and measures implemented by the Government. While investment in the oil and gas sector is moderating, overall investment is expected to be supported by the on-going implementation of infrastructure projects and capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors. Exports are projected to remain weak following more subdued demand from Malaysia's key trading partners. Overall, while the domestic economy remains on track to expand in 2016 and 2017, the uncertainties in the global environment could weigh on Malaysia's growth prospects. Inflation was lower as the impact from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) implemented in April 2015 lapsed and is expected to remain stable in an environment of low global energy and commodity prices and generally subdued global inflation. Consequently, inflation is projected to be lower at 2  3 percent in 2016, compared to an earlier projection of 2.5  3.5 percent, and continue to remain stable in 2017. Overall domestic financial conditions have remained stable since the previous MPC meeting with financial markets continuing to function in an orderly manner. The risks of destabilising financial imbalances have receded. Both macro and micro prudential measures as well as supervisory oversight have resulted in more prudent lending standards and contained speculative activities in the property market. The adjustment to the OPR is intended for the degree of monetary accommodativeness to remain consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path amid stable inflation, supported by continued healthy financial intermediation in the economy. The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. Bank Negara Malaysia 13 July 2016."
Chile,2016-07-14,"Santiago. Chile, 14 July 2016 Monetary Policy Meeting  July 2016 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3.5%. Internationally, the biggest news has been the limited effects of the UK referendum result. The world growth outlook has seen no significant changes and market expectations point towards more expansionary monetary policies in the developed economies. In this context, after an initial rise in volatility, preference for risk has increased, bringing down long-term interest rates and risk premiums, boosting stock markets and appreciating emerging countries' currencies. Commodity prices continue to post mixed movements, where an increase in the price of copper stands out. On the domestic front. June's CPI variation was somewhat higher than expected, but its path is in line with the forecast in the Monetary Policy Report. Expected inflation two years ahead remains at 3%. The evolution of these variables will continue to be monitored with special attention. Second-quarter output and demand data confirm limited growth. Confidence indicators are still in pessimistic territory. The labor market continues to reflect a deterioration in comparison to early in the year. The peso has appreciated. The Board estimates that, to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target, monetary policy will need to continue to normalize, at the pace that is implicit in the latest Monetary Policy Report's baseline scenario. Nonetheless, a significant deviation of inflation's convergence may change said pace. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2016-07-14,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that the improvements in the euro area, although weak, have continued. The Chinese economy has meanwhile maintained its moderate growth. The Board forecasts that, while the global economy will maintain its weak recovery going forward, it will be affected by factors including uncertainties related to Britain's exit from the European Union, changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and financial and economic conditions in emerging market countries. Looking at the Korean economy, while the sentiments of economic agents have been sluggish, the trend of decline in exports has continued but domestic demand activities including consumption appear to be improving. On the employment front, as the number of persons employed has increased, the employment-to-population ratio rose and the unemployment rate fell in June compared to those in June of last year. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of modest growth going forward, owing chiefly to expansionary macroeconomic policies, but in view of economic conditions domestically and abroad judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high. Consumer price inflation registered 0.8% in June, the same as in May, in line mainly with declines in agricultural product prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices rose slightly to 1.7%, from 1.6% in May. In the housing market, sales and leasehold deposit prices showed low rates of increase. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will remain at a low level for the time being, and then gradually rise as the effects of the low oil prices diminish. In the domestic financial markets, stock prices and the Korean won-US dollar and Korean won-Japanese yen exchange rates fluctuated temporarily to large extents after the Brexit decision. Long-term market interest rates have fallen considerably, owing largely to declines in government bond rates in major countries. Household lending has sustained a trend of substantial increase at a level exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in household debt, the effects of the Brexit, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and the progress of corporate restructuring."
Peru,2016-07-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2016 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.25 percent. The Board has taken this decision considering that: Inflation expectations have continued to reverse gradually; The effects of the rise in the prices of some food products and utilities as well as the effects of the exchange rate on inflation have been reversing; Local economic activity has been showing a pace of growth close to its potential growth level, and The global economy continues showing mixed signals of recovery in terms of production and employment as well as lower volatility in financial markets. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to evaluate the convenience of making additional adjustments in the monetary policy rate. Inflation is expected to return to be within the target range before the end of the year. Inflation in June showed a rate of 0.14 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate of inflation has fallen from 3.5 percent in May to 3.3 percent in June. The items that explained the rate of inflation in June were gasoline, fish, and cigarette. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.2 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate remained at 3.3 percent. Inflation expectations have continued to decrease gradually and continue showing a a declining path from an expected rate of 3.2 percent in the next 12 months to a rate of 2.9 percent in 2017 and a rate of 2.5 percent in 2018. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for August at the Board meeting that will be held on August 11, 2016."
Mongolia,2016-07-18,"THE BANK OF MONGOLIA MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy interest rate unchanged Number: 2016/03 Effective date: 18 July 2016 As its meetings on 7-8 July 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia decided to keep the policy interest rate unchanged at 10.5 percent. Annual inflation measured by CPI was 1.6% nationwide and core inflation declined to 2.9% as of June 2016, have continuously been lower than the targeted level for the last consecutive 12 months. The inflation dynamics in the first half of this year were consistent to the Bank of Mongolia's forecasts. Demand-driven inflationary pressure, caused by economic activities, is not expected to increase considerably in the short run. Therefore, inflation target is fully achievable at the end of this year. Although, uncertainties in macroeconomic external environment have still been continuing, market risk shall be decreased as the governance stability is maintained. Real economic growth is projected to be around the same level of 2015 due to positive expectation on an increase of foreign direct investments in the second half of this year, which supports domestic demand. This policy decision shall retain the opportunities to increase money supply through private credits and promote real sector activities. Increasing net foreign assets and decreasing budget deficits shall reduce the risks of private sector contraction, further rapid rise in unemployment from current rate of 11.6%, and shortage of financial resources. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Turkiye,2016-07-19,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 9 percent to 8,75 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,. b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 10.5 percent to 10.25 percent. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. While domestic demand continues to have a positive impact on growth, demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports. Accordingly economic activity displays a moderate and stable course of growth. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Recently, domestic developments have led to fluctuations in financial markets. The Committee assesses that the recent liquidity measures have alleviated the volatility in financial markets. Moreover, the tight monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policies and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August 2015 have increased the resilience of the economy against shocks. Also considering its contribution to the effectiveness of monetary policy, the Committee decided to take a measured and cautious step towards simplification. The Committee has indicated that inflation may display a marked increase in the short term due to developments in unprocessed food and tobacco prices. Meanwhile, the core inflation trend is expected to improve gradually. Yet, the developments in inflation outlook necessitate the maintenance of a tight liquidity stance. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. Moreover, market developments will be closely monitored and the necessary liquidity measures will continue to be taken to support financial stability. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Brazil,2016-07-20,"The Copom released the following note to the public:. ""The Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 14.25 percent, without bias. The basic scenario with which the Committee works can be summarized by the following observations:. The set of indicators released since the last Copom meeting shows a perspective of economic activity stabilization in the short term. However, evidences suggest that the economy continues to operate with a high level of idleness. In the external area, the scenario remains challenging. In the short term, the environment is relatively benign for emerging economies. However, the dynamics of the global economic recovery remain fragile, with uncertainties regarding its growth. Inflation expectations collected by the Focus survey for 2017 fell, but continue above the 4.5% inflation target; and. Conditional Copom's projections for inflation have remained relatively stable over the relevant horizon for monetary policy since the last meeting, but declined as compared to projections released in the latest Inflation Report. In the baseline scenario, the projection for 2017 inflation is around the 4.5% target. However, in the market scenario, the projection for 2017 is around 5.3%. The Committee identifies the following domestic risks to the basic scenario for inflation:. On the one hand, inflation higher than expected in the short term, largely due to food prices, may show persistence; uncertainties regarding the approval and implementation of the necessary adjustments in the economy remain; and a prolonged period with high inflation and above target expectations can strengthen inertial mechanisms and delay the disinflation process. On the other hand, the adjustments in the economy can be implemented more quickly, allowing confidence gains and reducing inflation expectations; and the idleness level in the economy can produce disinflation faster than what is reflected in the Copom projections. Taken together, the basic scenario and the current balance of risks indicate no room for monetary easing. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Anthero de Moraes Meirelles. Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira. Luiz Edson Feltrim. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Reinaldo Le Grazie.

Euroarea,2016-07-21,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that the monthly asset purchases of €80 billion are intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. Today we discussed developments since our last monetary policy meeting in early June. Following the UK referendum on EU membership, our assessment is that euro area financial markets have weathered the spike in uncertainty and volatility with encouraging resilience. The announced readiness of central banks to provide liquidity, if needed, and our accommodative monetary policy measures, as well as a robust regulatory and supervisory framework, have all helped to keep market stress contained. Financing conditions remain highly supportive, which contributes to a strengthening in credit creation. They continue to support our baseline scenario of an ongoing economic recovery and an increase in inflation rates. At the same time, given prevailing uncertainties, the Governing Council will continue to monitor economic and financial market developments very closely and to safeguard the pass-through of its accommodative monetary policy to the real economy. Over the coming months, when we have more information, including new staff projections, we will be in a better position to reassess the underlying macroeconomic conditions, the most likely paths of inflation and growth, and the distribution of risks around those paths. If warranted to achieve its objective, the Governing Council will act by using all the instruments available within its mandate. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2016, after 0.4% in the last quarter of 2015. Growth continues to be supported by domestic demand, while export growth has remained modest. Incoming data point to ongoing growth in the second quarter of 2016, though at a lower rate than in the first quarter. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the economic recovery to proceed at a moderate pace. Domestic demand remains supported by the pass-through of our monetary policy measures to the real economy. Favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability continue to promote a recovery in investment. Sustained employment gains, which are also benefiting from past structural reforms, and still relatively low oil prices provide additional support for households' real disposable income and thus for private consumption. In addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is expected to be mildly expansionary in 2016 and to turn broadly neutral in 2017 and 2018. At the same time, headwinds to the economic recovery in the euro area include the outcome of the UK referendum and other geopolitical uncertainties, subdued growth prospects in emerging markets, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. Against this background, the risks to the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside. According to Eurostat, euro area annual HICP inflation in June 2016 was 0.1%, up from -0.1% in May, mainly reflecting higher energy and services price inflation. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are likely to remain very low in the next few months before starting to pick up later in 2016, in large part owing to base effects in the annual rate of change of energy prices. Supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should increase further in 2017 and 2018. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continued to increase at a robust pace in May 2016, with its annual rate of growth standing at 4.9%, after 4.6% in April. As in previous months, annual growth in M3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 expanding at an annual rate of 9.1% in May, after 9.7% in April. Loan dynamics followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased to 1.4% in May 2016, compared with 1.2% in April. Developments in loans to enterprises continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained broadly stable at 1.6% in May, after 1.5% in April. The euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2016 indicates further improvements in loan supply conditions for loans to enterprises and households and a continued increase in loan demand across all loan categories. Furthermore, banks continued to report that the targeted longer-term refinancing operations had contributed to more favourable terms and conditions on loans. The monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 have significantly improved borrowing conditions for firms and households, as well as credit flows across the euro area. The comprehensive package of new monetary policy measures adopted in March this year underpins the ongoing upturn in loan growth, thereby supporting the recovery of the real economy. In the light of the prevailing uncertainties, it is essential that the bank lending channel continues to function well. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need to preserve an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. As emphasised repeatedly by the Governing Council, and as again strongly echoed in both European and international policy discussions, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the European level. The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up to reduce structural unemployment and boost potential output growth in the euro area. Structural reforms are necessary in all euro area countries, although specific reform needs differ across the individual economies. The focus should be on actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, which are vital to increase investment and boost job creation. The enhancement of current investment initiatives, including the extension of the Juncker plan, progress on the capital markets union and reforms that will improve the resolution of non-performing loans will also contribute positively to this objective. In an environment of accommodative monetary policy, the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms, in line with the 2016 country-specific recommendations recently approved by the European Council, will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also make the euro area more resilient to global shocks. Fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. Full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact over time and across countries is crucial to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework. At the same time, all countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies."
South Africa,2016-07-21,"South African Reserve Bank Press Statement Embargo Delivery 21 July 2016 Statement of the Monetary Policy Committee Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank The UK vote to leave the European Union has dominated the global landscape in the past month. The outlook for the global economy has become more uncertain as the potential consequences of these developments are being assessed. The lack of clarity regarding the process going forward has had significant implications for global growth and interest rates as the prospects for further near-term monetary policy tightening by the US Fed recede. While there have been spillovers to the South African financial markets, particularly the exchange rate, the direct short-term impact on South African growth and trade is likely to be fairly limited. Domestic growth has surprised further on the downside, and the outlook remains constrained. At the same time domestic inflation outcomes have surprised marginally on the downside, but an extended breach of the target is still expected. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas moderated to 6,1 per cent in May, before rising to 6,3 per cent in June. Food price inflation measured 11,0 per cent in June, below the recent peak of 11,3 per cent in April, and was marginally negative on a month-on-month basis. Goods 1 price inflation measured 6,7 per cent, up from 6,6 per cent in May, while services increased by 5,8 per cent, up from 5,7 per cent in May. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity measured 5,6 per cent, up from 5,5 per cent previously. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods continued its downward trend, declining from 7,0 per cent in April to 6,5 per cent in May mainly due to a further moderation in price inflation of food, beverages and tobacco products. This was below the consensus forecast of 6,9 per cent. The impact of the drought is still evident in the increase in prices of agricultural products, particularly cereals and other crops as well as live animals and animal products. The latest inflation forecast of the Bank shows a marginal improvement compared with the previous forecast. Nevertheless, inflation is still expected to accelerate further this year and is only expected to return to within the target range of 3-6 per cent during the third quarter of 2017. Inflation is now expected to average 6,6 per cent in 2016 and 6,0 per cent in 2017, compared with 6,7 per cent and 6,2 per cent previously. In 2018 inflation is expected to average 5,5 per cent, marginally up from the previous forecast. The expected peak, at 7,1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016, is down from 7,3 per cent. The downward revisions are due in part to lower administered price inflation (mainly petrol), despite a small upward adjustment in the international oil price assumption. The forecast for core inflation is lower than the previous forecast in the near term, mainly due to the lower starting point, but higher in the outer period. Core inflation is expected to moderate from an average of 5,8 per cent in 2016 to 5,3 per cent by 2018. Whereas previously core inflation was expected to breach the upper end of the 2. Whereas previously core inflation was expected to breach the upper end of the 2 target range in the third quarter of 2016 for four consecutive quarters, a one-quarter breach, at 6,1 per cent, is now expected in the fourth quarter of this year. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research have remained relatively anchored at the upper end of the inflation target range. In the second quarter, average expectations for 2016 were 6,3 per cent, up from 6,2 per cent. Average expectations for 2017 were unchanged at 6,2 per cent and were marginally down to 5,9 per cent for 2018. Expectations of business people were more or less unchanged compared to the previous quarter. Both analysts and trade union officials revised up their near-term forecasts, while forecasts for 2018 were revised lower. Average 5-year inflation expectations declined from 6,1 per cent to 5,9 per cent in the second quarter, with downward revisions by all groups. The median expectations of market analysts, as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in July, show a moderate decline since May. Inflation expectations declined from 6,7 per cent and 6,4 per cent in 2016 and 2017, to 6,6 per cent and 6,1 per cent. The yield differential between inflation linked bonds and conventional government bonds (break-even inflation expectations) declined across all maturities but remain elevated. The global economic outlook has been influenced by the outcome of the UK referendum. The financial markets displayed a high degree of volatility in the immediate aftermath of the outcome, but have stabilised to some extent since then. Nevertheless the longer term real impacts are expected to be negative for global growth, particularly for the UK and Europe, as investment decisions are put on hold during the transition period. A high degree of uncertainty is expected to persist for 3. A high degree of uncertainty is expected to persist for 3 some time as the magnitude of this slowdown is still unclear and dependent on the nature and speed of the UK disengagement. Since the referendum, global growth forecasts have generally been revised down. The outlook for emerging markets has remained relatively subdued, with further downside risks in Turkey following the recent coup attempt and terrorist attacks. Recent outcomes in China indicate some improvement in the growth prospects in response to government stimulus packages, and this has underpinned a stabilisation and moderate upward trend in commodity prices. The IMF growth forecasts released earlier this week have revised sub-Saharan African growth downwards. The region has been negatively impacted by lower commodity prices and severe drought in some parts. Inflation in the advanced economies remains low and still generally below target. The Brexit vote has also modified expectations regarding monetary policy in these economies. Although the Bank of England kept policy rates on hold at its most recent meeting, expectations are for a reduction in the policy rate in the near future, with the prospect of a resumption of quantitative easing. Markets are now expecting the US policy rate to remain unchanged for some time. At the same time, the highly accommodative monetary policy stances of the ECB and Bank of Japan are expected to persist, with the possibility of additional stimulus. These developments have reinforced the global search for yield, as yield curves flattened across major advanced economy markets. The number of government bonds trading with negative yields increased further. This has provided additional impetus to renewed capital flows to emerging markets observed since earlier this 4. This has provided additional impetus to renewed capital flows to emerging markets observed since earlier this 4 year. While these flows are expected to persist, they remain sensitive to changes in expectations regarding US monetary policy and general global risk perceptions. The recent volatility experienced by the rand exchange rate has been driven mainly by external factors and changes in global risk perceptions. Although the rand depreciated sharply in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, it has reversed these losses, and more so against the British pound. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has traded in a range of R15,80 and R14,22 against the US dollar, and has appreciated by 11,0 per cent against the US dollar, by 12,9 per cent against the euro and by 23,0 per cent against sterling. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand has appreciated by 12,2 per cent. The rand has been supported by the global search for yield. There was a sharp increase in non-resident inflows to the domestic bond and equity markets in June and July. Since the beginning of June, net purchases by non-residents of R107,3 billion have been recorded. The rand also responded positively to the improvement in commodity prices, and the unexpectedly large trade surplus recorded in May which followed a small surplus in April. Despite this recent strength, the rand remains vulnerable to possible “risk-off” global scenarios; changes in US monetary policy expectations; and domestic concerns including the possibility of ratings downgrades later in the year. The domestic economic growth outlook remains extremely challenging, following the contraction in GDP in the first quarter of this year. Although this is anticipated to have been the low point of the cycle, the recovery is expected to be weak. The Bank's latest forecast is for zero per cent growth in 2016, compared with 0,6 per cent previously. Growth rates of 1,1 per cent and 1,5 per cent are forecast for the next 5. Growth rates of 1,1 per cent and 1,5 per cent are forecast for the next 5 two years, down from 1,3 per cent and 1,7 per cent previously. The Bank's estimate of potential output has been revised down marginally to 1,4 per cent in 2016, rising to 1,7 per cent in 2018. This growth outlook is corroborated by the persistent negative trend in the Bank's leading indicator of economic activity. Business confidence remains low with the RMB/BER business confidence indicator falling to its lowest level since 2009 in the second quarter of this year. Recent economic data suggest that positive growth was recorded in the second quarter, with the mining and manufacturing sectors expected to add positively to growth. The more positive trend in manufacturing is consistent with the Barclays PMI which has been above the neutral 50 level since March. The BER manufacturing confidence index also improved, but still remains at low levels. The real value of building plans passed is indicative of some improvement in the sector, particularly with respect to residential construction. However, this is not reflected in the FNB/BER building confidence index which declined further in the second quarter. Underlying the negative performance of the economy during the first quarter was the sharp contraction in growth in gross fixed capital formation for the second consecutive quarter, by both the private sector and general government. These trends have contributed to the persistence of high rates of unemployment in the economy. Although formal non-agricultural employment increased in the first quarter of 2016, this was largely due to temporary employment opportunities created by the Independent Electoral Commission. By contrast, private sector employment contracted during the first quarter. Growth in consumption expenditure by households also contracted in the first quarter, with a sharp slowdown in expenditure on durable goods in particular. The 6 FNB/BER consumer confidence index declined in the second quarter to low levels, following a moderate improvement in the previous quarter. The BER retail confidence index also declined sharply in the second quarter. While new vehicle sales remained weak, vehicle exports recorded strong growth in the second quarter. Despite the surprise increase in retail and wholesale trade sales in May, consumption expenditure by households is expected to remain subdued given the low consumer confidence, high debt levels, rising costs of debt servicing, and slow employment growth. Consumption expenditure has been further constrained by the absence of significant wealth effects owing to the weak performance of asset markets, particularly the housing market. Credit extension to households also remains weak, with negative real rates of growth. Average wage growth has remained relatively stable, but there are risks of increases in excess of inflation and productivity gains. There are as yet no clear signs of a recovery in the agricultural sector, and food price inflation is expected to remain elevated for some time. The Bank expects food price inflation to peak at 12,6 per cent during the final quarter of this year. There are some encouraging signs of moderation in some food categories at both the producer and consumer price levels, and futures prices of grains have declined markedly. Should food prices stabilise or decline in the coming months, there is the potential for significant downside base effects next year. Exchange rate developments will also be critical in this respect, as will global food prices, which have reversed their recent negative trend. Despite supply disruptions and curtailments by a number of producers, the price of Brent crude oil has mostly traded within a band of US$45 and US$50 since the 7. Despite supply disruptions and curtailments by a number of producers, the price of Brent crude oil has mostly traded within a band of US$45 and US$50 since the 7 previous meeting of the MPC. The Bank's model assumes a very moderate upward trend in oil prices over the forecast period, but there may be a degree of downside risk in the short term, with some upside risk in the outer period as global demand recovers. The domestic petrol price increased by a cumulative 60 cents per litre in the past two months, due to both the exchange rate and international prices. However, the recent appreciation of the rand coupled with a lower average oil price has resulted in a substantial over-recovery in the petrol price, and a sizeable reduction in retail prices is expected in August. The Monetary Policy Committee remains concerned about the weak economic growth outlook and the medium term inflation trajectory which remains outside the target range of 3 to 6 per cent until the second half of next year. Nevertheless there have been some improvements in the near term inflation prospects following successive downside surprises. This is also the case for core inflation, where the expected breach of the upper end of the target range is now less protracted. While the risks to the inflation forecast are assessed to remain on the upside, these risks have moderated somewhat. Global uncertainties appear to have delayed monetary policy tightening in advanced economies. The impact of the more appreciated rand exchange rate on the inflation outlook will depend to a large extent on whether the exchange rate is sustained at these stronger levels. Current exchange rate levels are stronger than those implicit in the forecast, providing some buffer to the projections. The rand remains sensitive to both domestic and external developments, and the recent trends can be quickly reversed. 8 The outlook is clouded by the uncertainty surrounding the longer term market and global growth implications of Brexit. The implications for the rand and domestic growth, and ultimately inflation, could vary quite significantly depending on which scenario plays out. A weaker global growth scenario could also imply that there may be a degree of downside risk to the international oil price assumption, which was adjusted upward. A combination of a stronger exchange rate and subdued international oil prices would have a favourable impact on domestic petrol prices in the coming months. However, the committee assesses the longer term risk to this assumption to be on the upside, as global growth and oil demand are expected to recover. Food prices remain an upside risk in the near term. There could however be a sharp decline in agricultural prices next year should favourable weather patterns transpire as forecast. The absence of demand pressures and weak consumption expenditure growth may also contribute to downside risks. While the committee remains concerned about the overall inflation trajectory, the assessment of the balance of risks to the inflation outlook and the weak domestic economy has provided some room to delay further tightening of the monetary policy stance for now. Accordingly the MPC has unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7,0 per cent per annum. The MPC is aware that some of the favourable factors that contributed to this decision could reverse quickly, and remains ready to react appropriately to any significant change in the inflation outlook. 9 Lesetja Kganyago GOVERNOR Contact person: Candice Jeffreys +27 12 313 4209 candice.jeffreys@resbank.co.za 10."
Israel,2016-07-25,"Background conditions. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor June increased by 0.3 percent, similar to the average of forecasters' predictions. The fruit and vegetables component declined by 3.5 percent, and the clothing and footwear component increased by 8.3 percent, both against a seasonal background. The inflation rate as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was -0.8 percent, similar to the 12 months ending in May. Excluding the direct effect of energy prices and administrative price reductions, the CPI increased by 0.6 percent over the past 12 months. Prices of tradable goods in the CPI declined by 2.8 percent over the past 12 months, compared with declines of 3.2 percent in the 12 months ending in May and of 3.6 percent in the 12 months ending in April. The change in trend is a result of the beginning of the exhaustion of the directnegative contribution of energy prices. The prices of nontradable items increased by 0.3 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: There was no significant change in inflation expectations for the various ranges. One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market increased to 0.5 percent (compared with 0.4 percent in the previous month). Expectations for inflation over the coming 12 months derived from banks' internal interest rates remained at 0.3 percent, and private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings are for an increase of 0.8 percent, on average (similar to the previous month). Third-year forwardexpectations remained unchanged (1.1 percent). Longer term expectations remained within the target range with medium-term (3-5 years) expectations at 1.45 percent, and longer term (5 C2 AD-10 years) expectations at 2.2 percent. Most indicators show that there is no expectation of anincrease in the Bank of Israel interest rate in the next year. The labor market: The picture conveyed by the labor market remains positive. Wage increases continue in all industries. Real wages increased by 2.5 percent (seasonally adjusted) in February-April compared with the three previous months, while nominal wagesincreased by 3.1 percent. In June, the minimum wage was raised by about 4 percent. Health tax receipts for AprilC 2AD-June were 5.5 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period in the year before, reflecting the increase in employment and wages. The job vacancy rate declined to 3.5 percent (seasonally adjusted) in June, but this level remains high and, combined with the decline in the growth rate of employee posts,it indicates that there is apparently some shortage of workers in certain industries. Budget data: The cumulative domestic deficit (excluding net credit) in government activity was NIS 1.8 billion in January-June 2016, compared with a deficit of approximately NIS 1.0 billion in the corresponding period of 2015, and it is about NIS 4.9 billion smaller than the deficit in the seasonal path consistent with achieving the deficit target for 2016. The deviation reflects revenues that were NIS 3.2 billion higher than the path, and expenditures that were NIS 1.7 billionlower than the path. Tax revenues in June were NIS 22 billion, which is about NIS 1.4 billion higher than the seasonal path consistent with the estimate of tax revenue (NIS 277 billion). Tax revenues in January-June were about 6.3 percent higher in real terms than in the corresponding period of the previous year. Gross domestic VAT collection declined by about 0.7 percent in real terms compared with June of 2015 (it increased by about 5.1 percent net of the effect of legislative changes). The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on June 26, 2016, through July 22, 2016, the shekel strengthened by 1.2 percent against the dollar, and by 1.7 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the preceding 12 months, the shekel appreciated by 1.8 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on June 26, 2016, through July 21, 2016, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 6 percent. Government bond yields increased moderately along the unindexed curve, and declinedby up to 10 basis points along the indexed curve. The makam curve traded at a yield ranging around the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, declined to 75 basis points. The money supply: In the 12 months ending in June, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 23.5 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 12.5 percent. The credit market: In June, the businesssector (excluding banks and insurance companies) issued bonds totaling NIS 2 billion, after issuances totaled NIS 2.7 billion in May. The average of monthly issuances in the past year was about NIS 2.7 billion. The volume ofnet mutual fund withdrawals remained high in June, totaling NIS 2 billion.In contrast, funds specializing in corporate bonds in Israel continued to attract net new investment in June. By the middle of July mutual funds returned to net new investment. Corporate bond spreads continued to decline, over the full month, in most industries, and were about 3.4 percentage points, on average (excluding bonds of financial corporations) at the beginning of July. According to the Companies Survey, in general, there is no evidenceof financing constraints in the business sector, despite some increase in financing difficulties reported by small and medium businesses and companies in the construction industry. In June, which typically has a seasonally high level of new mortgages taken out, the total volume of new mortgages taken out was NIS 5.6 billion, slightly higher than the average of the past 12 months (NIS 5.3 billion). The share of mortgages issued for the purchase of investment homes continues to decline, to 13.5 percent in May, compared with an average of 15 percent in the past 12 months. The average interest rate on mortgages continued to increase in June on all tracks: On the fixed-rate CPI-indexed track, rates increased by 0.05 percentage points, while on the variable-rate CPI-indexed track, rates increased by 0.19 percentage points. Rates on the fixed-rate unindexed track increased by 0.07 percentage points, and on the variable-rate unindexed track rates increased by 0.04 percentage points. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.1 percent in June,after remaining unchanged in May. The rate of home prices increases remains high. Home prices increased by 0.3 percent in April-May, and by 7.8 percent in the 12 months ending in May, similar to the increase in the 12 months ending in April. Activity in the market remains robust, with 7,800 transactions carried out in May, slightly lower than the average over the past 12 months (about 8,100 transactions per month). The volume of new homesales continues to increase moderately, reaching about 2,750 in May, and the stock of homes available for sale continued to increase in May, reachingapproximately 28,700 homes. The global economy: In the days following the referendum in the UK, financial markets were considerably volatile. However, in the weeks that have elapsed since then, most markets stabilized,after a rapid response by the Bank of England and the ECB, and after the political situation in the UK stabilized. The direct effect of the Brexit decision has thus far been reflected in a depreciation of the pound sterling,declines in bank share prices in Europe, and widespread redemptions from commercial real estate funds in the UK. With that, the economic and political uncertainty remains high. The International Monetary Fund reduced its global growth forecast for 2016 and for 2017 by 0.1 percentage points, and theforecast for growth in world trade in 2016 was lowered by 0.4 percentage points. The forecasts are based on the assumption that there will be no further deterioration in the financial markets, and that the UK and the EU willsucceed in preventing a sharp increase in economic barriers. Had it not been for the Brexit decision, the IMF would have slightly increased its growth forecast. In the US, the estimate of first quarter growthwas revised upward, and growth in the second quarter is expected to be about 2.4 percent. Indicators of activity in the manufacturing sector were positive this month, and personal consumption data remain strong, although consumer confidence weakened following the Brexit vote. The probability of increase in the interest rate by the end of the year: as derived from the markets: declined following the Brexit vote, but increased again following the publication of labor market data for June, which surprised tothe upside in a number of parameters. In Europe, there was growth of just 0.5 percent in the manufacturing sector (relative to the same period last year), with contraction in Germany and Italy and low growth of retail sales. The purchasing managers' indices, which were sampled after the Brexit vote, do not show a significant negative impact as a result of the decision. Inflation increased slightly and returned to positive territory. The ECB did not change its monetary policy at its most recent meeting. The banking system, primarily in Italy, is a source of risk to the eurozone's economy. In the UK, real economic data for the period preceding the referendum have not yet been published. The Bank of England surprised marketswhen it did not reduce its interest rate, but it is expected to do so in August. In Japan, activity data continue to indicate weakness, and estimations are that further accommodative measures will be taken following the electoral victory of the ruling party. In China, official growth data indicate relatively high second quarter growth, based on broad government investment. The price of a barrel of oil declined this month from around $50 to about $46, and the index of commodities excluding energy also resumed its decline, falling by about 4 percent from its level in the previous month. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for August 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within theprice stability target range of 1-3 percent a year, and to supportgrowth while maintaining financial stability. The Monetary Committee continues to assess that in view of the inflation environment, and of developments in growth in Israel and in the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. C 2B 7 The inflation environment continues to increase moderately. The Consumer Price Index increased in the past three months, and short-term inflation expectations remained stable this month after increasing in previousmonths, but they are still below the lower bound of the inflation target range. Medium and long-term expectations remain anchored within the target range. C 2B 7 Indicators of activity are in line with the assessment that the economy continuesto grow at the rate that characterized recent years, led by private consumption and by industries focused on domestic activity. The slowdown in manufacturing is concentrated at high-technology industries, and a trend of increase in services exports is becoming apparent. The picture conveyed by labor market data continues to be positive, and there are signs that the economy is nearing full employment. C 2B 7 In the weeks since the referendum in the UK, most financial markets stabilized. However, the uncertainty regarding the ramifications of theBrexit process is expected to remain high, and due to the Brexit decision,the IMF reduced its global growth forecast. In Europe, weakness is becoming apparent and risks to the economy are increasing, while in the US, indicators of activity, primarily labor market data, were strong. The monetary policy of major central banks is expected to remain very accommodative. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on June 26, 2016, through July 22, 2016, the shekel strengthened by 1.2 percent against the dollar. In terms of the effective exchange rate, the shekel appreciated by 1.7 percent, similar to the rate of appreciation over the past 12 months. The level of the effective exchange rate continues to weigh on the growth of exports and of the tradablesector. C 2B 7 The rate of increase in home prices remains elevated, and both the level of transactions and the volume of mortgages remain high. The stock of homes for sale continues to increase. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to achieving the inflation target and to growth remain high. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for August 2016 will be published on August 8,2016. The decision regarding the interest rate for September 2016 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. August 29, 2016."
Nigeria,2016-07-26,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No 108 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of th th Monday and Tuesday 25 and 26 July 2016 th th The Monetary Policy Committee met on 25 and 26 July 2016 against the backdrop of fragile global and domestic economic and financial conditions. The Committee evaluated the global and domestic macroeconomic and financial developments in the first six months of 2016 and the outlook for the rest of the year. In attendance were 8 members. International Economic Developments The Committee noted the continued sluggish growth in global output, being underpinned by weak demand and slowing productivity. In addition to existing risks, rising debt levels in the Emerging Market Economies (EMEs), volatile financial markets and the vote of the United Kingdom to exit the European Union “BREXIT” have lessened the prospects for a more prosperous global economy in 2016. Consequently the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in July 2016, further downgraded its baseline forecast for global growth to 31 per cent from 32 in April. The Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forecast for global output in 2016 is even less optimistic at 30 per cent. Slower global growth prospects is traced to weak trade, sluggish investment, 2 protracted weak aggregate demand and low commodity prices; which have translated to output declines in the Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs). The Brexit vote has created widespread uncertainty and elevated volatility in the global financial markets. The United States (US) economy grew by 08 per cent in Q1 of 2016, though, much lower than the 14 per cent growth recorded in the last quarter of 2015. The tapered growth was attributed to the goods sector which continues to struggle under the weight of declining factory activity; the hitherto resilient service sector is now losing steam while trade remains under pressure from a strong dollar and weak domestic demand. The Japan economy grew at an annualized rate of 17 per cent in Q1 of 2016, a reversal of the negative growth recorded in Q4 of 2015. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) at its th th 15 -16 July meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, maintained its monthly asset purchase at ¥67 trillion (US$6393 billion), leaving the policy rate also unchanged at negative 01 per cent. The Euro Area grew by 06 per cent in first quarter, 2016, up from 03 per cent, recorded in fourth quarter of 2015. Downside risks to the growth outlook have, however, risen following the Brexit vote. The Governing Council of the st European Central Bank (ECB), at its meeting of July 21 , 2016, retained its key interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and 4 the deposit facility at 000, 025 and -040 per cent, respectively, with the expectation that they would remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. The ECB also sustained its monthly asset purchases of €80 billion (US$8791) until March 2017, with possibility of extension. In anticipation of and to mitigate the impact of the Brexit vote, the Bank of England (BoE) voted to continue its ₤375 billion (US$495 billion) monthly assets purchase program, financed through the issuance of reserves and possible increase in the quantum should the need arise. The Bank also retained its policy rate at 05 per cent, with a commitment to stimulate inflationary growth towards its 20 5 per cent long run path. The Bank also hinted at a possible further easing of monetary policy in August, 2016. Major EMDEs continued to face declining capital inflows, rising financing costs and geo-political tensions, all of which pose constrain to growth. Depressed commodity prices continued to tilt the balance of risk towards the downside, thus, dampening prospects for near term economic and financial recovery in the EMDEs. Consequently the IMF (WEO July 2016 Update) downgraded the 2016 growth forecast for this group of countries to 41 from 43 per cent in the April projection. In July, oil and other commodity prices rallied against the backdrop of better-than-expected economic data on China 6 in the second quarter, sustained attacks on oil production facilities in Nigeria, and continued unrest in Libya. Nonetheless global inflation remained subdued despite widespread easing of monetary policy. In the advanced economies, recent developments such as BREXIT has increased the uncertainty surrounding the future of the Euro zone thus further weakening demand and suppressing inflation. Consequently while the stance of monetary policy in most advanced economies is expected to remain accomodative through fiscal 2016 in the EMDEs, it is expected to remain mixed, reflecting diversity and multiplicity of shocks confronting them. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output The Nigerian economy is still saddled with the effects of the shocks of the first quarter of 2016; which led to a contraction in output arising from energy shortages, high electricity tariffs, price hikes, scarcity of foreign exchange and depressed consumer demand, among others. Whereas the influence and persistence of some of the factors waned in the second quarter, it is unlikely that the economy rebounded strongly in the quarter as setbacks in the energy sector continued owing mainly to vandalism of oil installations. In addition, the implementation of the 2016 budget in the second quarter remained slower than expected in the second quarter. The Committee noted that most of the conditions undermining domestic output 8 growth were outside the direct purview of monetary policy. It nonetheless, hopes that the deregulation in the downstream petroleum sector and the liberalization of the foreign exchange market would help bring about the much needed relief to the economy. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicate that domestic output in the first quarter of 2016 contracted by 036 per cent, the first negative growth in many years. This represented a decline of 247 percentage points in output from the 211 per cent reported in the fourth quarter of 2015, and 432 percentage point lower than the 396 per cent recorded in the corresponding period of 2015. Aggregate output contracted in virtually all sectors of the economy, with the non-oil sector recording a decline of about 018 per cent, compared with the 314 per cent 9 expansion in the preceding quarter. Agriculture and Trade were the only sectors with positive growth at 068 per cent and 040 per cent, respectively. Industry. Construction and Services contracted by 093, 026 and 008 percentage point, respectively. Prices The Committee noted a further rise in year-on-year headline inflation to 1648 per cent in June 2016, from 1558 per cent in May; 1372 per cent in April, 1277 per cent in March and 1138 per cent in February 2016. The increase in headline inflation in June reflected increases in both food and core components of inflation. Core inflation rose sharply for the fourth time in a row to 1622 per cent in June, from 1505 per cent in May; 1335 per cent in 10 April; 1217 per cent in March; 1100 per cent in February and 880 per cent in January having stayed at 870 per cent for three consecutive months through December, 2015. Food inflation also rose to 1530 per cent in June, from 1486 per cent in May; 1319 per cent in April; 1274 per cent in March; 1135 per cent in February, 1064 per cent in January and 1059 per cent in December, 2015. The rising inflationary pressure was largely a reflection of structural factors, including high cost of electricity, high transport cost, high cost of inputs, low industrial activities as well as higher prices of both domestic and imported food products. The MPC expressed strong support for the urgent diversification of the economy away from oil to manufacturing, agriculture and services; and called on all 11 stakeholders to increase investment in growth stimulating and high employment elasticity sectors of the economy in order to lift the economy out of its current phase. Monetary Credit and Financial Markets Developments Broad money supply (M2) grew by 826 per cent in June, 2016, a 480 percentage points increase from 346 per cent in May compared with the 054 per cent contraction in June 2015. When annualized. M2 grew by 1652 per cent in June 2016 against the provisional growth benchmark of 1098 per cent for 2016. Net domestic credit (NDC) grew by 1252 per cent in the same period and annualized at 2504 per cent. At this rate, the growth rate of NDC exceeded the provisional benchmark of 1794 per cent for 2016. There was no change in the level of banking sector net credit to government in June, contrasting the 3145 per 12 cent growth in May. Credit to the private sector grew by 1445 per cent in June 2016, which annualizes to a growth of 2890 per cent, outperforming the benchmark growth of 1338 per cent for the year. The MPC expressed cautious satisfaction over the improved performance of credit to the private sector and urged the Bank to ensure that the tempo is sustained inorder to stimulate recovery of output growth. The MPC noted that the level of money market interest rates largely reflected the liquidity situation in the banking system during the review period. Average inter-bank call rate, which stood at 200 per cent on 17th June 2016, closed at 500 per cent on July 15, 2016. The increase was attributed in part; to the newly introduced foreign exchange framework and the mop up of naira liquidity due 13 to increased sale of foreign exchange by the CBN during the period. Generally the period under review witnessed a decline in volume of activity in the inter-bank market owing to injections by FAAC and maturity of some CBN securities. The MPC also noted the decline in the indices of the equities segment of the capital market. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) declined by 626 per cent from N1017 trillion to N950 trillion during the same period. Relative to end-December 2015, the indices fell by 343 per cent and 355 per cent, respectively. Globally however, the equities markets remained generally bearish, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. 14 External Sector Developments The MPC noted the actions taken by the Bank as part of the implementation of the flexible foreign exchange regime decided at its meeting in May which was designed to improve liquidity and stabilize the foreign exchange market. The Bank introduced a flexible exchange rate regime in the inter-bank market; introduced a Naira-settled OTC-FMDQ-OTC trading platform, adopted two-way quote trading platform at the inter-bank foreign exchange market and appointed foreign exchange primary dealers. However the average naira exchange rate weakened at the inter-bank segment of the foreign exchange market during the review period following the liberalization of the market. The exchange rate at the interbank market opened at N19700/US$ and closed at N29290/US$, with 15 a daily average of N24495/US$ between May 25 and July 19, 2016. The initial weakness was attributable to the normal market reaction to a new regulatory reform. The MPC reaffirmed its commitment to its statutory mandate of achieving a stable naira exchange rate. The MPC’s Considerations The MPC recognized the weak macroeconomic environment, as reflected particularly in increasing inflationary pressure and contraction in real output growth. In view of this, the MPC underscored the imperative of coordinated action, anchored by fiscal policy, to initiate recovery at the earliest time. Members called on the Federal Government to fast-track the implementation of the 2016 budget in order to stimulate economic activity to 16 bridge the output gap and create employment. In the same vein, the MPC expressed concern over the non-payment of salaries in some states and urged express action in that direction to help stimulate aggregate demand. On its part, and as a complementary measure, the MPC restated its commitment to measures and deployment of relevant instruments within its purview to complement fiscal policy with a view to restarting growth. The Committee also enjoined deposit money banks (DMBs) to partner with Government and the Bank in this direction, by redirecting credit from low employment generating sectors to those capable of supporting growth, reducing unemployment and improving citizen standards of living. 17 Members agreed that the economy was passing through a difficult phase, dealing with critical supply gaps and underscored the imperative of carefully navigating the policy space in order to engender growth and ensure price stability. The MPC therefore, summarized the two policy options it was confronted with as restarting growth or fighting inflation. The MPC was particularly concerned that headline inflation spiked significantly in June 2016, approaching twice the size of the upper limit of the policy reference band. The Committee noted that inflation had risen significantly, eroding real purchasing power of fixed income earners and dragging growth. The MPC was further concerned that while the situation called for obvious tightening of the monetary policy stance, the recession confronting the 18 economy and the prospects of negative growth to year- end needed to be factored into the policy parameters. The arguments in favour of growth were anchored on the premise that the current inflationary episode was largely structural. In particular, members noted the prominent role of cost factors arising from reform of the energy sector, leading to higher domestic fuel prices and electricity tariffs and prolonged foreign exchange shortages arising from falling oil prices leading to higher inputs costs, domestic fuel shortages, increased transportation costs, security challenges, reform of the foreign exchange market reflected in high exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices of imports. Consequently the current episode of inflation, being largely non-monetary but largely structural, tightening at this point would only serve to worsen 19 prospects for growth recovery as the Bank had in June 2016, withdrawn substantial domestic liquidity through the foreign exchange market upon introduction of the flexible foreign exchange market regime. Members however, noted the negative effect of inflation on consumption and investment decisions and its defining impact on the efficiency of resource allocation and investment. The MPC further noted the prolonged non-payment of salaries, a development which has affected aggregate demand and worsened growth prospects. It also noted that at the May MPC meeting, members weighed the risks of the balance of probabilities against growth and voted to hold, allowing fiscal policy some space to stimulate output with injections, but this has been long in coming. 20 The MPC in putting forward for tightening considered the high inflationary trend which has culminated into negative real interest rates in the economy; noting that this was discouraging to savings. Members also noted that the negative real interest rates did not support the recent flexible foreign exchange market as foreign investors attitude had remained lukewarm, showing unwillingness in bringing in new capital under the circumstance. Members further noted that there existed a substantial amount of international capital in negative yielding investments globally and Nigeria stood a chance of attracting such investments with sound macroeconomic policies. Consequently members were of the view that an upward adjustment in interest rates would strongly signal not only the Bank’s commitment to price stability but also its desire 21 to gradually achieve positive real interest rates. Such a decision, it was argued, gives impetus for improving the liquidity of the foreign exchange market and the urgent need to deepen the market to ensure self-sustainability. Members were of the opinion that this would boost manufacturing and industrial output, thereby stimulating growth which is desired at this time. The Committee’s Decisions The MPC, recognizing that the Bank lacked the instruments required to directly jumpstart growth, and being mindful not to calibrate its instruments in such a manner as to undermine its primary mandate and financial system stability, in assessment of the relevant issues, was of the view that the balance of risks remains tilted against price stability. Consequently five members voted to 22 raise the Monetary Policy Rate while three voted to hold. In summary, the MPC voted to: Increase the MPR by 200 basis points from 1200 to 14 per cent; Retain the CRR at 2250 per cent; Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 3000 per cent; and Retain the Asymmetric Window at +200 and -500 basis points around the MPR Thank you for listening.

Georgia,2016-07-27,"27.07.16 NBG Reduces Its Policy Rate by 25 basis points to 6.75%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on July 27, 2016 and decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 6.75 percent. The monetary policy decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, according to which the phasing out of tight monetary policy must continue in order for inflation to reach its target value. According to the forecast unless other factors affecting the economy are realized, the monetary policy rate may be expected to decrease to 6% in the medium term. The annual CPI inflation in June dropped more than it was expected, to 1.1%. This decrease was largely due to the decrease in inflation expectations and larger-than-expected transmission of the decline in the world prices of oil and foodstuff. Expiration of base effect and weak aggregate demand were other factors causing inflation to drop. According to the current forecast the inflation will remain low in the coming quarters reaching the target by the end of 2017. External demand is still weak; in the first half of the year the annual decrease of export was 12%. The economic growth forecast has increased as a result of higher activity in both domestic and foreign investment, however due to external factors, the growth is still expected to remain below potential. The forecast risks have increased given the significant uncertainty in the region. The National Bank also pays attention to the impact of monetary policy on financial markets. Based on all the aforementioned factors the further rate of monetary policy softening will depend on the processes taking place in the economy, possible realization of external sector risks and the magnitude of shock transmission from trade partner countries to Georgian economy. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on September 7, 2016."
United States,2016-07-27,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market strengthened and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate. Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May. On balance, payrolls and other labor market indicators point to some increase in labor utilization in recent months. Household spending has been growing strongly but business fixed investment has been soft. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Stanley Fischer; Loretta J Mester; Jerome H Powell; Eric Rosengren; and Daniel K Tarullo. Voting against the action was Esther L George, who preferred at this meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. Implementation Note issued July 27, 2016."
Egypt,2016-07-28,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release July 28, 2016 In its meeting held on July 28, 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 1175 percent, 1275 percent, and 1225 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1225 percen. Headline year-on-year inflation rose to 1397 percent in June 2016 from 1230 percent in May 2016, while the month-on-month rate dropped to 078 percent in June from 305 percent in Ma. Core inflation rose to 1237 percent in June 2016 from 1223 percent in May 2016, while the month-on-month rate dropped to 074 percent in June from 315 percent in Ma. Annual headline inflation in June 2016 was partly affected by unfavorable base effects from the previous year and remained elevated due to the relatively high month-on-month inflation in May 201. Monthly headline inflation in June 2016 came mainly on the back of higher prices of volatile food items, in addition to core food items, particularly red meat and poultr. Furthermore monthly headline inflation was affected by retail items, particularly seasonal increases in the prices of clothing and footwear associated with the Eid-Al-Fitr festivitie. The pass-through of previous exchange rate movements to domestic prices as measured by the consumer price index remained limite. Output remained unfavorably impacted by domestic as well as external factor. Domestic demand contributed 48 percentage points to the 45 percent real GDP growth in the first half of 2015/16, while net external demand contributed negative 03 percentage point. By sector, the services sector was the highest contributor to economic growth, particularly construction and real estate, while tourism contributed negativel. Furthermore growth continued to be supported by internal trade, agriculture and the general government sectors, whereas the industrial sector contributed negatively mainly due to continued weakness in the mining activity, but also due to negative contribution of non-petroleum manufacturin. At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlook. The MPC reiterates its price stability mandate and will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, particularly fiscal policy and its effect on the inflation outlook, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Israel,2016-07-28,"Currency (Unit) Rate Daily Change. Nominal Effective Rate 0.205%. In recent weeks, the Bank of Israel Monetary Committee has been examining the possibility of changing the frequency of interest rate decisions, which currently take place once a month. In the past two years, a number of central banks have reduced the frequency of monetary policy decisions. Among others, the ECB, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan have transitioned from monthly decisions: twelve or more decisions per year: to a twice quarterly frequency: eight decisions per year. As part of the Bank of Israel's examination, the potential implications of a transition to eight policy decisions per year are being assessed. A change in the frequency of interest rate decisions may require adjustments in the banking corporations' IT systems. As such, the Bank of Israel has approached the banking corporations to obtain an assessment from them regarding the ramifications of such a change in that context. Should a decision be reached to change the frequency of the decisions, the Bank of Israel will notify the public a few months before the change comes into effect."
Ukraine,2016-07-28,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the key policy rate to 15.5%, effective from 29 July 2016. Further alleviation of risks to price stability enabled the NBU to ease monetary policy, which is consistent with the need to achieve the NBU's inflation objectives set at 12% +/-3% for 2016 and 8% +/-2% for 2017. In June 2016, headline inflation slowed to 6.9% y-o-y. Actual inflation decelerated at a faster-than-projected pace. Low aggregate demand, a gradual appreciation of the hryvnia exchange rate, and a high supply of food products have contributed to the slowdown in inflation. Real wages resumed growth in annual terms. However, as before, consumer demand did not exert additional pressure on inflation. With the external conditions remaining broadly favorable, a net foreign exchange supply was recorded in the domestic market. Under such circumstances, the NBU continued to purchase foreign currency to replenish its international reserves while not hampering a gradual appreciation of the exchange rate. As anticipated, the consequences of June's relaxation of administrative restrictions appeared to be manageable and did not destabilize the FX market. Also, a high supply of raw foods pushed food prices down in H1 2016. Overall, these factors contributed to a faster-than expected slowdown in core inflation, having more than offset a contribution from administered prices and tariffs as well as oil prices. The slowdown of actual inflation, along with the exchange rate appreciation, contributed to improvements in inflation expectations of households, businesses, and the expert community. As previously projected, the medium-term inflation objectives remain unchanged at 12% by the end of 2016 and 8% by the end of 2017. In H2 2016, annual headline inflation is expected to approach the target, mainly due to the reflection of upward adjustments in statistics for utility tariffs. At the same time, inflation in respect of other consumer basket components (core inflation and raw food prices) is expected to slow at a faster pace. The faster-than-expected deceleration can be attributed to the slowdown in imported inflation in the wake of low exchange rate volatility and improved inflation expectations. The NBU has also maintained its annual real GDP growth forecast unchanged at 1.1% by the end of 2016 and 3.0% by the end of 2017. However, we revised the current account deficit forecast downwards from USD 2.3 billion to USD 1.8 billion. The downward revision reflects lower natural gas imports, improvements in the terms of trade, a projected high yield of crops, and larger private remittances from abroad. Headline inflation might come in below the 2016 year-end inflation objective of 12% should assumptions other than those reflected in the baseline forecast scenario materialize. These assumptions include more significant effects of subdued consumer demand, the oversupply in the domestic market resulting from a high yield of crops, and favorable external conditions. In the medium-term perspective, the resumption of cooperation with the IMF, absence of adverse shocks in external markets, de-escalation of hostilities in the east of Ukraine, and, as a consequence, further improvements in inflation expectations remain the key factors supporting disinflation. Should the baseline forecast scenario materialize and risks to price stability abate further, the NBU will continue to move ahead with monetary easing. This move will promote the reduction of borrowing costs and boost economic growth. The decision to cut the key policy rate to 15.5% is approved by NBU Board Decision No. 172-рш, dated 28 July 2016. On the Key Policy Rate. A detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 4 August 2016. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held as scheduled on 15 September 2016."
Colombia,2016-07-29,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 7.75%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In June, annual consumer inflation and the average of core inflation indicators increased, reaching 8.6% and 6.5%, respectively. Analysts' inflation expectations to one and two years posted at 4.6% and 3.7%, respectively, and those embedded in public debt bonds (2, 3, and 5 years) remained relatively stable within a range of 4.0% and 4.5%. The strong increase in food prices as well as nominal depreciation and its partial pass-through to consumer prices mainly continue explaining the difference of inflation and the inflation target. Although El Nino ended and the exchange rate has not exhibited any strong upward trend for a number of months now, the intensity of these shocks produced a deviation of inflation and its expectations from the target, and triggered some indexation mechanisms. The effects of the trucking strike on consumer prices will be felt in July, but it is expected that they fade quickly. Global economic activity remains weak, and it is forecast that the average growth of Colombia's trading partners in 2016 will be lower than the one observed in 2015. In the United States, the Fed maintained its benchmark interest rate unaltered, and it is likely that strengthening of the monetary policy in that country will be more gradual. The price of oil has fallen, but it remains at levels above those recorded at the beginning of the year. With this, it is likely that deterioration in the dynamics of national income be lower than the estimated a quarter ago. The most recent figures of economic activity suggest that output growth in the second quarter of 2016 would be similar to that recorded in the first quarter. For 2016, the technical staff revised its forecast of the most likely figure of growth from 2.5% to 2.3%, within a range between 1.5% and 3.0%. These forecasts imply a domestic demand that continues to adjust, partly as a response to the deterioration in the dynamics of national income. The new figures for foreign trade indicate that the external deficit continued to fall in the second quarter. For all 2016, the technical staff forecasts a further reduction of the current account deficit. In this new forecast, the deficit would be US $15 billion, which would be equivalent to 5.3% of GDP. This behavior reduces the country's vulnerability to adverse external shocks. In all, inflation rose due to the past depreciation of the peso, the lagged effect of El Nino (which is already over), inflation expectations exceeding the target, and by the activation of some indexation mechanisms. Similarly, the Colombian economy continues to adjust in an orderly manner to the strong shocks recorded since 2014, and the current account deficit is correcting gradually. In this context, the response of the monetary policy must acknowledge that the shocks that have affected prices are transitory, and seeks to anchor inflation expectations in order to convergence of inflation to the 3.0% target (=C2=B11 pp) in 2017. With this purpose, the Board deemed appropriate to increase the benchmark reference rate by 25 basis points. The adjustment of the monetary policy will continue contributing to the correction of the external deficit. The Board of Directors reaffirms its commitment to maintain inflation and its expectations anchored to the target, acknowledging that there has been a transitory increase in inflation. Similarly, the Board will continue to follow up on the effects of the adjustment of expenditure on inflation."
Russia,2016-07-29,"On 29 July 2016, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 10.50 percent per annum. The Board notes that inflation dynamics and the nascent rebound in economic activity are overall aligned to the Bank of Russia's baseline forecast. However, the decline in inflation expectations has stalled. This decision, along with the maintenance of moderately tight monetary policy, will help deliver on the inflation target. The Bank of Russia forecasts that the annual growth rate of consumer prices will be less than 5% in July 2017, to reach the target of 4% in late 2017. The Bank of Russia will consider the possibility of a further rate cut based on estimates for inflation risks and the alignment of inflation decline with the forecast trajectory. In making the key rate decision, the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia was guided by the following considerations:. First. Inflation is currently slowing down in line with the Bank of Russia's baseline forecast. This is helped by the economic environment including steady Russian financial market, persistently weak consumer demand and the indexation of administered prices and rates as previously planned. The Bank of Russia estimates the annual growth rate of consumer prices to decline, as of 25 July 2016, to 7.2%. At the same time, there has been a stop in the decline of core inflation, seasonally adjusted monthly growth rates of consumer prices and inflation expectations. The slowdown of inflation is set to continue, primarily triggered by demand-side constraints. The lower — compared to last year's — indexation of administered prices and rates in July, as well as the expectations for good crops, will contribute to the slowdown of inflation, helping recede inflation expectations. According to the Bank of Russia forecast, as the moderately tight monetary conditions remain in place, annual inflation will dip below 5% in July 2017 to reach the target level of 4% by late 2017. Second. The tight monetary conditions will be maintained, although somewhat eased following the contraction of the banking sector's liquidity deficit and the June 2016 reduction in the Bank of Russia key rate. The real interest rates in the economy (adjusted for inflation expectations) will stay at a mark where demand for credit will be met without heightened inflationary pressure, retaining the incentives to save. To enable operating control over the level and structure of market interest rates, in the context of the switchover to a nascent liquidity surplus in the banking sector, the Bank of Russia will use the appropriate toolset to absorb liquidity. Third. Production recovery fails to cause consumer price growth amid slack demand. Import substitution steps up and non-commodity exports expand. Economic dynamics are patchy across sectors and regions. Industry, including manufacturing, discovers new opportunities for growth. At the same time, certain industries stagnate or show lower output growth, while investment continues to contract. Nevertheless, the trend for economic recovery prevails. Positive quarterly growth of GDP is possible in the second half of the year. Annual GDP growth is predicted to enter positive territory in 2017. Fourth. The risks of failure to deliver on the 4% inflation target in 2017 persist following primarily, along with the external risks, the inertia of inflation expectations and the uncertainty over specific fiscal consolidation measures, including wage and pension indexation. The emerging trend towards wage increase and deposit rate cut may undermine households' propensity to save. To alleviate these risks, the Bank of Russia has to keep rates at a level that encourages saving, brings down inflation expectations and promotes sustainable inflation reduction to the target level. The Bank of Russia will consider the possibility of a further rate cut based on estimates for inflation risks and the alignment of inflation decline with the forecast trajectory.

Pakistan,2016-07-30,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement July 30, 2016 Pakistan economy posted notable improvements in FY16 as average annual CPI inflation declined to 47 year low of. percent and real GDP growth touched an 8-year high of. percent. Foreign exchange reserves held by SBP recorded steady increases and while covering four months of imports stood at USD18. billion by end-June 2016. Government's efforts at reducing budget deficit remained on track as its revenue collection exceeded expectations. Private sector credit posted considerable surge with accelerating loans for fixed investment and working capital. Growth in broad money was contained as the government borrowing remained lower. Discreetly evaluating the outlook of these improvements. SBP cut its policy rate by cumulative 75bps in FY16; over and above cut of 300bps in FY15. Both external and domestic factors have contributed towards improvement of the economy. On the external front, despite decline in exports growth, foreign exchange market remained broadly stable due to lower oil prices, healthy workers' remittances, and adequate official capital inflows. While on the domestic side, an increase in FBR revenues has helped in increasing development spending, while at the same time maintaining fiscal deficit close to the target level. Although increased demand for currency and at times government borrowing from commercial banks kept the money market under pressure, effective injections to keep the market sufficiently liquid by SBP has helped in better transmission of monetary policy. This was visible in overnight repo rate which on average remained closer to the policy rate. Overall 6-month KIBOR has seen steeper 93bps reduction in FY16, compared to 75 bps reduction in the policy rate during May 2015 to May 2016. Thus in turn, it has helped in remarkable increase of Rs461 billion in private sector credit in FY16, compared to Rs224 billion in FY15. This indicates that existing lending rates together with the provision of liquidity are supporting the accelerating pace of private sector credit. Going forward in FY17, factors affecting the outlook for external sector are broadly similar to that of FY16. Even with slight increase in current account deficit, on account of expected higher non-oil imports, positive growth in workers' remittances are likely to keep it at manageable levels. At the same time, substantial bilateral and multilateral project loans related flows in the financial account will help maintain an overall surplus in the balance of payments. Further addition to this surplus is likely to come from increased foreign portfolio investments on the back of reclassification of Pakistani stock market in the Emerging Markets Index by MSCI. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN However, unexpected increase in oil prices may result in wider trade deficit. Further deterioration in global trade due to slowdown in China may accentuate this problem. Slowdown in Gulf region may decelerate growth in workers' remittances. Furthermore uncertainties about recovery in the EU in the post Brexit period can have repercussions for financial inflows and trade to the country. Pakistan's economic growth is set to increase further in FY17. The impetus is likely to come from the continuation of same positive factors as of FY16, which include: rising investment under PSDP and CPEC; improved energy availability to industry; lagged impact of prudent monetary policy; healthy private sector credit uptake; and improving law and order situation. Adverse supply shocks, continued declining trend in commodity prices, and any setback to security situation may hamper the possibility of attaining the GDP growth target of. percent in FY17. In the absence of these risks and building on to the current momentum. GDP growth can also experience spurt in FY17. Two intertwined factors are central in shaping up this possible scenario. First investments and activities related to PSDP and CPEC are going to gain full traction which will be crucial in giving further boost to construction and allied industries, large scale manufacturing, electricity generation and its impact on services sector, and promoting an investment climate in the country. Second successful end to the IMF program will bring the much-needed confidence boost to Pakistan economy and the government which can further enhance the growth prospects in FY17. Increased economic activity may impact inflation. Accordingly SBP forecasts average CPI inflation in the range of.5-5. percent for FY17. Any upward adjustments in gas tariff, fiscal slippages, and supply disruptions pose risk to this assessment. Uncertain global oil price is the major risk to this projection. In addition to the sluggish global demand, possible dampening impact of Brexit on global commodity prices and difficulties in clearing excess domestic food stock also poses risk to this inflation forecast. Monetary Policy Committee, after detailed deliberations, has decided to maintain the policy rate at.75 percent. Page."
Thailand,2016-08-03,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 3 August 2016 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 3 August 2016 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed the economy to continue recovering at a gradual pace despite facing greater downside risks from increased uncertainties in the global economy. Meanwhile inflation might return to the target band slightly later than previously assessed due to weaker-than-expected energy prices. Monetary conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery. Hence the Committee judged that the policy rate should be kept on hold at this meeting. The Thai economy continued to recover at a gradual pace driven mainly by public expenditure and tourism. Private consumption also expanded on the back of improvements in income and confidence of agricultural households. Nevertheless private investment remained low, and merchandise exports still contracted due to weaker-than-expected demand from Asian economies. Overall the Thai economy was projected to expand at the rate close to the previous assessment, although downside risks increased from the last meeting. These included uncertainties following the British referendum (‘Brexit'), concerns over the European financial sector, and political developments abroad, which could impact confidence and the economic outlook of trading partners going forward. Meanwhile financial stability risks in China remained. Headline inflation in July softened slightly on account of raw food prices, while core inflation remained stable. The Committee expected that headline inflation would still gradually rise, although the timing of its return to the target band might be delayed, depending on global oil price movements. The Committee viewed that overall monetary conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery. This was reflected in low real interest rates and a continued expansion in total corporate financing and household credits, although certain business sectors faced limitations in obtaining credits. Nonetheless the baht appreciated against some major currencies over the recent period, which might not be beneficial to the ongoing economic recovery. In addition, financial stability risks from the prolonged low interest rate environment, including search-for-yield behavior, continued to warrant close monitoring. The Committee saw the need to preserve policy space given that the Thai economy would still be facing more uncertainties going forward, particularly the fragile global economic recovery, and uncertainties in the monetary policy directions of major advanced economies that might induce greater capital flow and exchange rate volatility. Going forward, the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative, and stands ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to ensure that monetary conditions are conducive to the economic recovery, while ensuring financial stability."
Czech Republic,2016-08-04,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions. It confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna against the euro so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the CNB still stands ready to intervene automatically, i.e. without the need for an additional decision of the Bank Board, and without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the koruna exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until mid-2017. Inflation is still well below the CNB's target of 2%. According to the new forecast, inflation will start rising in the near future, driven by increasing domestic economic activity and wages. At the same time, the anti-inflationary effect of import prices will weaken. Inflation will slightly exceed the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon and then return to it from above. According to the new forecast, sustainable fulfilment of the target, which is a condition for a return to conventional monetary policy, will occur in mid-2017. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the new forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being balanced. A need to maintain expansionary monetary conditions at least to the current extent persists. The Bank Board therefore states again that the CNB will not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017. The Bank Board still considers it likely that the commitment will be discontinued in mid-2017. Domestic inflation is still being affected by anti-inflationary cost effects from abroad, especially commodities. Monetary policy looks past the first-round effects of such factors and focuses on any adverse second-round effects. In this context, the CNB still stands ready to shift the exchange rate commitment to a weaker level if there were to be a systematic decrease in inflation expectations manifesting itself in nominal variables, especially wages. Turning to the assumptions of the forecast regarding developments abroad, economic growth in the effective euro area will fluctuate around 2% over the entire forecast horizon. However, the negative impact of the outcome of the UK referendum on leaving the EU on economic sentiment will result in a temporary slowdown in foreign growth to just under 2% next year. The previous sharp decline in energy commodity prices is reflected in an outlook for continued subdued growth in foreign producer prices, which are not expected to return to annual growth until the start of next year. Consumer price inflation abroad will also rise gradually, but will stay below 2% over the entire forecast horizon. The market outlook for 3M Euribor rates, which is negative until the end of 2018, reflects subdued inflation in the euro area and continued easy monetary policy of the ECB. The market outlook for the Brent crude oil price is gradually rising over the next two years. Domestic inflation slowed slightly in 2016 Q2 and was still well below the lower boundary of the tolerance band around the CNB's target. However, core inflation, i.e. adjusted inflation excluding fuels, remains noticeably positive. It reflects the positive effect of growth in the domestic economy and wages. Headline inflation will start to rise in the near future and slightly exceed the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon, i.e. 1218 months ahead. The increase in the price level will continue to be fostered by favourable developments in the domestic economy, especially rising wages. The pick-up in inflation will also be due to an unwinding of the anti-inflationary effects of import prices and renewed growth in administered prices and food prices. During 2018, inflation will return to the 2% target from above. Monetary policy-relevant inflation, i.e. inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, will differ only marginally from headline inflation, deviating downwards from it in 2016 and 2018 and slightly upwards next year. Monetary policy-relevant inflation will therefore also slightly exceed the target at the monetary policy horizon. The growth of the Czech economy slowed in 2016 Q1 and will moderate further in the rest of the year according to the forecast. This is because gross capital formation will decline this year owing to a drop in government investment co-financed from EU funds. By contrast, the economy continues to be supported by still easy monetary conditions, low commodity prices and rising external demand. After the drop in government investment unwinds, economic growth will pick up to 3% next year amid still robust household consumption. The economy will then grow at the same pace in 2018. The rising economic activity will manifest itself in continued growth in employment, although its pace will slow. This will result in a further, albeit only modest, decrease in the unemployment rate. Wage growth will accelerate further in both the business and non-business sectors. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until mid-2017. Consistent with the forecast is an increase in market interest rates thereafter. According to the forecast, the return to conventional monetary policy will not result in the exchange rate appreciating sharply to the slightly overvalued level recorded before the CNB started intervening, among other things because the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to the price level and other nominal variables. At the same time, the Bank Board stated that any exchange rate appreciation following the discontinuation of the exchange rate commitment would also be dampened by hedging of exchange rate risk by exporters during the existence of the commitment, by the closing of koruna positions by financial investors and by possible CNB interventions to mitigate exchange rate volatility. The outlook for both headline and monetary policy-relevant inflation for the next year is slightly higher compared to the previous forecast. This is due to a slightly higher short-term prediction for food and fuel prices, a higher outlook for administered prices and faster observed and expected growth in nominal wages. The inflation forecast is virtually unchanged at the monetary policy horizon (i.e. in the second half of next year). GDP growth this year has been revised slightly upwards, mainly as a result of a somewhat lower downturn in investment than expected. By contrast, the economic growth forecast for 2017 has been lowered owing to a worse outlook for external demand. The assumption of flat market interest rates at their current very low level and the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument until mid-2017 remains unchanged. The path of market interest rates after the assumed exit from the use of the exchange rate is almost unchanged compared to the previous forecast. In the new forecast, nominal wage growth in the business sector has shifted slightly upwards until mid-2017."
Romania,2016-08-04,"Video (Romanian only): Press briefing, 4 August 2016 Press conference, 8 August 2016 - quarterly inflation report. In its meeting of 4 August 2016, the Board of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) decided the following:. The NBR Board examined and approved the August 2016 Inflation Report, which will be released for the public in a press conference on 8 August 2016. The annual inflation rate was further negative, yet posted a 2.3 percentage point increase in June 2016 (to -0.7 percent from -3.0 percent in March 2016), as a result of the dropping-out of the first-round effect of broadening the scope of the 9 percent reduced VAT rate to all food items in June 2015. The annual inflation rate remaining in negative territory is solely attributable to the effect induced by lowering the standard VAT rate from 24 percent to 20 percent in January 2016. The average annual CPI inflation rate stood at -2.0 percent in June, while the average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is relevant for assessing convergence with the European Union, came in at -1.7 percent. The economic growth sped up to 4.3 percent (annual change) in 2016 Q1, following the rapid expansion of domestic absorption, mainly of consumer demand, amid higher incomes of households, the easing of the fiscal policy stance and the consolidation seen by the dynamics of private sector credit. On the supply side, the tertiary sector became the most dynamic component, making a prevailing contribution to GDP growth. The economy-wide average wage earnings saw again faster growth rates (mainly amid a new raise in the economy-wide gross minimum wage), which outpaced significantly labour productivity dynamics. Stimulative real monetary conditions propped up the upward trend of leu-denominated loans. The annual dynamics of leu- and foreign currency-denominated loans posted even more divergent developments, the share of leu-denominated loans in total loans to the private sector climbing to 54.7 percent in June 2016 (versus a 34.6 percent low in May 2012). This evolution confirms the improved monetary policy transmission, while also helping mitigate the risks to financial stability. In today's meeting, the Board of the National Bank of Romania examined and approved the August 2016 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The baseline scenario reveals a projected path of the annual inflation rate that is significantly lower than that previously envisaged, amid the persistence of low inflation at global and regional levels, likely to affect the developments in core inflation, as well as volatile and administered price dynamics. The new forecast retains its upward profile, amid inflationary pressures from excess aggregate demand and unit labour costs. Thus, the projected path of the annual inflation rate will remain in negative territory until the end of 2016, before returning inside the variation band of the target in the course of 2017 and standing below the mid-point of the target at year-end. At the projection horizon, the annual inflation rate is forecasted to be in the upper half of the variation band of the flat target. Risks to the current projection stem from both domestic and external sources. On the domestic front, risks relate to fiscal and income policy stance, against the backdrop of the election year and the absence of agreements with the international financial institutions, along with adverse effects of changes to financial legislation. The external environment is marked by heightened uncertainty surrounding global economic growth and euro area economic recovery, amplified by the outcome of the UK referendum, geopolitical tensions and difficulties facing European banks. Based on currently available data and in the context of heightened uncertainty, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum, to pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system, and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The Board decisions aim to ensure price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The NBR Board reiterates that a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and progress in implementing structural reforms are pivotal to ensuring a stable macroeconomic framework and enhancing the resilience of the Romanian economy to withstand adverse conditions worldwide. The NBR is closely monitoring domestic and external developments for an adequate use and dosage of all its available tools to fulfil the overriding objective regarding medium-term price stability and preserve financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be released for the public in a press conference on 8 August 2016. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 30 September 2016."
India,2016-08-09,"Third Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2016-17 By Dr.Raghuram G. Rajan. Governor Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.5 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL); and continue to provide liquidity as required but progressively lower the average ex ante liquidity deficit in the system from one per cent of NDTL to a position closer to neutrality. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 6.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 7.0 per cent. Assessment 2. Since the second bi-monthly statement of June 2016, several developments have clouded the outlook for the global economy. Across advanced economies (AEs), growth in Q2 of 2016 has been slower than anticipated, and the outlook is still mixed. Headwinds in the United States from declining inventory investment were offset somewhat by strong payroll numbers. In the Euro area, the re-emergence of stress in some parts of the banking sector and the Brexit vote increased uncertainty. In Japan, downside risks have intensified in the form of a stronger yen, deflationary risks and contracting industrial production, triggering monetary and fiscal stimuli. Among emerging market economies, activity remains varied. GDP growth stabilised in China in Q2, on the back of strong stimulus. Manufacturing activity was weak in July due to adverse weather and subdued export demand, although smaller firms recorded an uptick in new orders. Recessionary conditions are gradually diminishing in Brazil and Russia, but the near-term outlook is still fragile due to policy uncertainties and soft commodity prices.2 4. World trade remains sluggish in the first half of 2016. International financial markets did not anticipate the Brexit vote and equities plunged worldwide, currency volatility increased and investors herded into safe havens. Since then, however, equity markets have regained lost ground. Currencies, barring the pound sterling, have stabilised, with the yen appreciating the most on risk-on demand as well as the announcement of fresh stimulus. Yields on government bonds have fallen further and the universe of negative yielding assets is expanding at a fast pace, reflecting high risk aversion and expectations of further monetary accommodation by systemic central banks. Crude prices, which had risen to an intra-year high in May on supply disruptions, remain volatile. Other commodity prices, barring those of precious metals, remain soft due to weak demand. On the domestic front, several factors are helping to support the recovery. After a delayed onset, the south west monsoon picked up vigorously from the third week of June. By early August, the cumulative rainfall was 3 per cent higher than the long period average, with more than 80 per cent of the country receiving normal to excess precipitation. Kharif sowing strengthened after a lacklustre start, particularly with respect to pulses. Barring cotton, jute and mesta, sowing of all crops is currently above last year's acreage. These developments engender greater confidence about the near-term outlook for value added in agriculture. The target for kharif production set by the Ministry of Agriculture appears within reach. Industrial production picked up in May on the back of manufacturing and mining, following a contraction in the preceding month. The uneven performance of industrial output reflects the lumpy and order-driven contraction of insulated rubber cables, a component of capital goods. Excluding this item, industrial production rose at 3.0 per cent in the current financial year. In fact, capital goods production excluding insulated rubber cables expanded by 8.0 per cent. Nonetheless, the prolonged sluggishness in the capital goods sector is indicative of weak investment demand. The rate of contraction in consumer non-durables slowed, pointing to some revival in rural demand. On the other hand, the pace of growth of consumer durables has been stable and buoyed by urban consumption demand, although it eased in May on base effects. Barring the contraction in natural gas and crude oil on account of structural bottlenecks, the core sector has been resilient as of 2016-17 so far, and should support industrial activity going forward. There are some signs of green shoots in manufacturing too, with purchasing managers and the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey indicating a pick-up in new orders, both domestic and external. Business confidence is also looking up in recent months, though the Reserve Bank's survey for March 2016 suggests that capacity utilisation, seasonally adjusted, is still weak. Service sector purchasing managers polled the thirteenth successive month of expansion in July on the basis of a sharp acceleration in new business. Business expectations remained optimistic on better economic conditions and planned increases in marketing budgets. High frequency indicators of service sector activity are still, however, emitting mixed signals, although a larger number of indicators are in acceleration mode in Q1 of 2016-17 than in the preceding quarter. Automobile sales across most segments, railway, port and international air freight traffic, foreign tourist arrivals, and domestic air passenger traffic are providing the underlying momentum for the upturn. The gradual improvement in the services sector is getting broad-based. Retail inflation measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) rose to a 22-month high in June, with a sharp pick-up in momentum overwhelming3 favourable base effects. The rise was mainly driven by food, with vegetable inflation higher than the usual seasonal rise at this time of the year. Sugar prices also firmed up due to a decline in domestic production after two successive years of drought. While pulses inflation started moderating, prices of pulses have been rising again since April after a short-lived correction in the previous quarter. Inflation pressures are also incipient in cereals. These developments fed through into households' inflation expectations three months ahead, reversing the decline seen in the last two quarters. Fuel inflation remained subdued, mainly due to sustained deflation in prices of liquefied petroleum gas. Excluding food and fuel, inflation eased across major sub- groups. Further excluding petrol and diesel from transport, inflation fell below 5 per cent for the first time since the introduction of the combined CPI. Softer inflation readings were recorded across services constituents in health, education, personal care and effects, and other categories of household consumption. Rural wage growth has been rising albeit moderately, driven up by wages of agricultural labourers. On the other hand, staff costs in the organised sector were relatively restrained. Liquidity conditions eased significantly during June and July on the back of increased spending by the Government which more than offset the reduction in market liquidity because of higher-than-usual currency demand. The injection of durable liquidity through purchases under open market operations (OMOs), amounting to 805 billion so far, also helped in easing liquidity conditions, bringing the system-level ex ante liquidity deficit to close to neutrality (albeit without seasonal adjustment). Accordingly, the average daily liquidity operation switched from net injection of liquidity of 370 billion in June to net absorption of 141 billion in July and 405 billion in August (up to August 8). The Reserve Bank conducted variable rate repos and reverse repos of varying tenors in order to manage evolving liquidity conditions, with a more active use of reverse repos to manage the surplus liquidity. Reflecting the easy liquidity conditions, the weighted average call rate (WACR) and money market weighted average rate remained on average 15 basis points below the policy repo rate since June. Interest rates on other money market instruments such as certificates of deposit (CDs) and commercial paper (CPs) have also declined in both the primary and secondary markets. In the external sector, merchandise export growth moved into positive territory in June after eighteen months. This upturn was reasonably widespread, covering chemicals, marine products, handicraft, plastic, rice, electronic and engineering goods. On the other hand, imports continued to decline, albeit at a slower pace than in recent months. While lower crude oil prices continued to compress the POL import bill, domestic demand for gold remained muted, with domestic gold prices trading at a discount vis-a-vis international prices. Non-oil non-gold imports continued to shrink, pulled down by coal, fertilisers, ores, iron and steel and machinery and transport equipment. Cumulatively, the trade deficit narrowed in Q1 of 2016-17 on a year-on- year basis. Net receipts on account of services remained flat in April-May 2016, with net outflow under communication services and sluggish software earnings. While the pace of foreign direct investment inflows slowed in the first two months of 2016-17, net portfolio flows were stronger after the Brexit vote, notwithstanding considerable volatility characterising these flows. The level of foreign exchange reserves rose to US$ 365.7 billion by August 5, 2016.4 Policy Stance and Rationale 12. The recent sharper-than-anticipated increase in food prices has pushed up the projected trajectory of inflation over the rest of the year. Moreover, prices of pulses and cereals are rising and services inflation remains somewhat sticky. There are early indications, however, that prices of vegetables are edging down. Going forward, the strong improvement in sowing on the back of the monsoon's steady progress, along with supply management measures, augers well for the food inflation outlook. The prospects for inflation excluding food and fuel are more uncertain; if the current softness in crude prices proves to be transient and as the output gap continues to close, inflation excluding food and fuel may likely trend upwards and counterbalance the benefit of the expected easing of food inflation. In addition, the full implementation of the recommendations of the 7th central pay commission (CPC) on allowances will affect the magnitude of the direct effect of house rents on the CPI. On balance, inflation projections as given in the June bi-monthly statement, i.e. of a central trajectory towards 5 per cent by March 2017 with risks tilted to the upside, are retained (Chart 1). Looking ahead, the momentum of growth is expected to be quickened by the normal monsoon raising agricultural growth and rural demand, as well as by the stimulus to consumption spending that can be expected from the disbursement of pay, pension and arrears following the implementation of the 7th CPC's award. The passage of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill augurs well for the growing political consensus for economic reforms. While timely implementation of GST will be challenging, there is no doubt that it should raise returns to investment across much of the economy, even while strengthening government finances over the medium- term. This should boost business sentiment and eventually investment. The current accommodative stance of monetary policy and comfortable liquidity conditions should also provide a congenial environment for the reinvigoration of aggregate demand conditions. However, successive downgrades of global growth projections by multilateral agencies and the continuing sluggishness in world trade points to further slackening of external demand going forward. Accordingly, the GVA growth projection for 2016-17 is retained at 7.6 per cent, with risks facing the economy at this juncture evenly balanced around it (Chart 2).5 14. Risks to the inflation target of 5 per cent for March 2017 continue to be on the upside. Furthermore, while the direct statistical effect of house rent allowances under the 7th CPC's award may be looked through, its impact on inflation expectations will have to be carefully monitored so as to pre-empt a generalisation of inflation pressures. In terms of immediate outcomes, much will depend on the benign effects of the monsoon on food prices. In view of this configuration of risks, it is appropriate for the Reserve Bank to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at this juncture, while awaiting space for policy action. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and will continue to emphasise the adequate provision of liquidity. Easy liquidity conditions are already prompting banks to modestly transmit past policy rate cuts through their MCLRs and pro-active liquidity management should facilitate more pass-through. It may be recalled that the refinements to the liquidity management framework effected in April 2016 were intended to smooth the supply of durable liquidity over the year using asset purchases and sales as needed, and progressively lower the average ex ante liquidity deficit in the system to a position closer to neutrality. The Reserve Bank intends to continue with this strategy, with the intention of closing the underlying liquidity deficit over time so that the system moves to a position of structural balance. As regards the management of the imminent FCNR(B) redemptions, the Reserve Bank has been frontloading liquidity provision through open market operations and spot interventions/deliveries of forward purchases. The Reserve Bank will continue with both domestic liquidity operations and foreign exchange interventions that should also enable management of the FCNR(B) redemptions without market disruptions. With a view to further front-loading the provision of liquidity, it has been decided to conduct an open market purchase auction on August 11, 2016. Details are being announced separately. The fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement will be announced on October 4, 2016. Alpana Killawala Press Release : 2016-2017/356 Principal Adviser."
Philippines,2016-08-10,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 3.0 percent. The corresponding interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation environment remains manageable. Latest forecasts continue to indicate that average inflation is likely to settle slightly below the 3.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point target range in 2016 and rise toward the mid-point of the target range in 2017 and 2018. The overall balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook is also seen to be broadly balanced, with upside risks emanating from pending petitions for adjustments in electricity rates. Slower global economic activity also remains the key downside risk to the inflation outlook. Meanwhile, inflation expectations continue to be broadly in line with the inflation target over the policy horizon. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that prospects for global economic growth have remained subdued since the previous meeting. By contrast, domestic economic conditions continue to be firm, supported by solid private household consumption and investment, buoyant business and consumer sentiment, and adequate credit and domestic liquidity. Higher fiscal spending is also expected to further boost domestic demand. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that current monetary policy settings remain appropriate. At the same time, increased uncertainty over prospects for growth and monetary policy action in major advanced economies requires prudence in policy settings. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions to ensure price and financial stability conducive to sustained economic growth."
Chile,2016-08-11,"Santiago. Chile, 11 August 2016 Monetary Policy Meeting  August 2016 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3.5%. Internationally, monetary and financial conditions are still expansionary and long-term interest rates remain low. It is worth noting the increased appetite for risk in global financial markets, particularly for emerging economies' assets. This has resulted in a drop in their sovereign premia, an increase in their stock markets and an appreciation of their currencies. On aggregate, world growth prospects are generally unchanged. Most commodity prices posted limited declines. On the domestic front, although July's inflation was somewhat higher than expected, the annual CPI variation returned to the tolerance range. Expected inflation two years ahead remains at 3%. The evolution of these variables will continue to be monitored with special attention. Second-quarter output and demand data showed limited growth. Confidence indicators are still in pessimistic territory. The labor market continues to reflect a gradual deterioration, but the unemployment rate has remained stable. The peso has appreciated. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2016-08-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that the Chinese economy has maintained its moderate pace of growth. However, the improvements in the euro area have weakened. The Board forecasts that, while the global economy will maintain its weak recovery going forward, it will be affected by factors including changes in the monetary policies of major countries, the uncertainties related to Britain's exit from the European Union, and economic conditions in emerging market countries. Looking at the Korean economy, exports have remained on their trend of decline but domestic demand activities including consumption appear to have continued their albeit moderate improvements. The sentiments of economic agents have meanwhile improved slightly. On the employment front, as the number of persons employed has increased, the employment-to-population ratio rose and the unemployment rate fell in July compared to those in July of last year. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of modest growth going forward, owing chiefly to expansionary macroeconomic policies, but in view of economic conditions domestically and abroad judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high. Consumer price inflation fell from 0.8% the month before to 0.7% in July, in line mainly with a slowdown in the rate of increase in service fees. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also declined to 1.6%, from 1.7% in June. In the housing market, sales and leasehold deposit prices showed low rates of increase. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will remain at a low level for the time being, and then gradually rise as the effects of the low oil prices diminish. In the domestic financial markets since July, stock prices have risen and the Korean won has appreciated to a large extent against the US dollar, as foreigners' securities investment funds have shown net inflows owing chiefly to expectations of monetary policy easing in major countries. The won has meanwhile appreciated against the Japanese yen, in line with the won's relative strengthening. Long-term market interest rates have shown slight fluctuations at low levels. Household lending has sustained a trend of substantial increase at a level exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in household debt, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and the progress of corporate restructuring."
Kazakhstan,2016-08-15,"PRESS - RELEASE #23 On the base rate August 15, 2016 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to keep the base rate unchanged at 13% with a corridor of +/- 1 percentage points, reflecting the mandate to reach the target range for inflation of 6- 8% and maintain it there until the end of 2017. The balance of risks to inflation has barely changed since previous decision on the base rate, but the impact of different multidirectional factors on inflation has increased. Subsequent decisions on the base rate will depend on, among other things, whether the actual and forecast inflation are relative to the target level. The decision on the base rate was made with the account of the following factors. Annual consumer inflation remains high, reflecting a significant increase in prices in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additional risks came from a seasonally-adjusted bump in July, caused mainly by a rise in prices for certain types of services and product groups. As the base effect begins to fade, a significant decline is expected in the annual inflation rate starting from October. The index of business sentiment, based on the survey of top-management of real sector enterprises, moved into the positive, a sign of gradual recovery in economic activity and a risk to inflation. Inflationary risks induced by oil prices, the main terms-of-trade determinant for Kazakhstan, have strengthened. The weakening in oil prices over the last two months, intensified in the third decade of July, was absorbed partly by the weakening of Tenge, in order to ease the associated external imbalances, but also contributing to a potential pass-through into domestic prices. However, the National Bank estimates that the pass-through of the July weakening will be limited in time and magnitude if oil prices recover to a level of USD 45 per barrel or higher. The current level of the base rate, even after the cut in July, remains attractive and encourages holding assets in Tenge. The effect of the previous decision on the base rate, stimulating banks to lower market rates, will be pronounced in the increasing demand for resources and the expansion of crediting activity closer to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the slow adaptation of economic agents to the new conditions. This and weak consumer demand are expected to limit the risks to inflation. The further reduction of the base rate will be based on the dynamics of actual inflation, its deviation from the forecast and target parameters, on inflation expectations, as well as the currency preferences of the population and market. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on October 3, 2016 at 17.00 Astana time."
Peru,2016-08-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2016 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.25 percent. The Board has taken this decision considering that: Inflation has returned to the target range; Inflation expectations continue to reverse gradually; The effects of the rise in the prices of some food products and utilities as well as the effects of the exchange rate on inflation have been reversing; Local economic activity has been showing a pace of growth close to its potential growth level, and The global economy continues showing mixed signals of recovery in terms of production and employment as well as lower volatility in financial markets. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to evaluate the convenience of making additional adjustments in the monetary policy rate. Inflation is expected to remain within the upper band of the inflation target range in the next months and to continue showing a downward trend in 2017, the rate of inflation at end-2017 being estimated at 2.0 percent. Inflation in July showed a rate of 0.08 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate of inflation has continued falling, declining from 3.3 percent in June to 2.96 percent in July. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.19 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate fell from 3.3 percent to 2.9 percent. Inflation expectations have continued to decrease and continue showing a a declining path, which is within the target range in the following years. Indicators of business expectations continue improving and are all on the optimistic side. In line with this, expectations of GDP growth rates in 2016 have risen from 3.7 percent in June to 3.8 percent in July, while expectations of GDP growth rates in 2017 have risen from 4.0 percent to 4.2 percent. However, the indicators associated with construcion and manufacturing have declined in July due to lower investment. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for September at the Board meeting that will be held on September 8, 2016."
Armenia,2016-08-16,"Press Release 16.08.2016 At the August 16, 2016 meeting, the Board of the CBA decided to cut the Refinancing Rate by 0.25 pp, setting it at 7.25%. Deflation in July of 2016 was 2.3%, mainly due to the decrease in prices of seasonal agricultural products and reduced gas tariff, under which circumstance the 12-month inflation rate reached -1.3% at the end of the month. A slow pace of global economic growth and relative stability in international commodity markets persisted. However, minor inflationary trends were observable in respect of some commodities. The CBA Board estimates that significant inflationary effects from the external sector are not likely in the upcoming months. According to the CBA assessment, the processes in the EU did not have a significant impact on the Armenian economy. The CBA Board notes that higher-than-expected economic activity was observable in Armenia, based on the H1, 2016 results, against the same reference period of the previous year, which was largely determined by positive developments in the tradable sector on the back of current external demand. At the same time, consistent implementation of monetary policy by the CBA has continuously reduced inflation expectations thus contributing to the dropping, as much as possible for the time, in the long-term market rates. The latter secured a real ground for gradual recovery in private consumption and domestic demand on the basis of the 2016 results. The CBA Board anticipates a further low inflation environment in the upcoming months while deflation will decelerate considerably at the end of the year. In that situation, the Board considers it reasonable to ease the monetary conditions under which circumstance the deflationary environment will phase out gradually and the 12-month inflation rate will return to its target in the forecast horizon. The CBA Board estimates that the deflationary risks are somewhat prevalent in the short run, and if these materialize, the CBA will react accordingly by fulfilling the inflation target in the medium run. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program. Q3, 2016) to be published on August 26, 2016. Press Service of the Central Bank."
Hungary,2016-08-23,"At its meeting on 23 August 2016, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 24 August 2016:. In the second quarter of 2016, the growth of the Hungarian economy picked up again following the temporary slowdown at the beginning of the year. A degree of unused capacity remains in the economy and inflation remains persistently below the Bank's target. Looking ahead, the disinflationary impact of the domestic real economic environment is gradually decreasing. In July 2016, consumer prices were slightly lower than a year earlier and core inflation rose somewhat relative to the previous month. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation continue to indicate a moderate inflationary environment in the economy. Persistently low global inflation is restraining the increase in domestic consumer prices. Inflation expectations are at historically low levels. Whole-economy wage growth remains strong, which is likely to raise core inflation gradually through rising household consumption. Inflation remains below the 3 per cent target over the forecast period, and only approaches it in the first half of 2018. Hungarian economic growth picked up again in the second quarter of 2016, in line with the Bank's expectations. Retail sales continued to expand at a dynamic rate in June. Household consumption is expected to continue growing in the coming quarters. Industrial production fell in June relative to the same period a year earlier. Labour demand remained strong, and therefore the unemployment rate fell further in the second quarter, accompanied by an increase in the number of employees. The time profile of this year's economic growth is characterised by duality. The economy picks up following temporary slow growth at the beginning of the year, mainly supported by domestic demand. The unwinding of adverse one-off factors affecting growth early in the year as well as the steps taken by both the Bank and the Government to support growth will result in the economy picking up further. Economic growth of around 3 per cent can be maintained by the extension of the Funding for Growth Scheme, the Growth Supporting Programme and the Government's measures to promote housing construction as well as by the faster drawdown and efficient use of EU funding. Moderate growth early this year has resulted in a more negative output gap temporarily; however, the acceleration in growth and the expansionary impact on demand of next year's budget contribute to the closure of the gap. Rising incomes and the pick-up in lending will contribute to the expansion in consumption, which in turn provides considerable support to economic growth in the coming years. Sentiment in global financial markets has been positive since the Council's latest interest rate-setting decision. Domestic asset prices have changed little over recent weeks. The forint exchange rate remains stable and yields fell slightly at the entire length of the curve. Hungary's strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. Following the previous signal by the Council, the change to monetary policy instruments announced in July supports a further reduction in vulnerability and encourages lending using targeted unconventional tools. In view of the assessment of the effects related to the announced measures as well as the volatile global financial environment, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank continues to closely monitor movements in interbank rates and developments in the money market and government securities market. The Monetary Council will make a decision on the required year-end level of the three-month deposit stock and the operational details of the use of the facility in September. In the Council's assessment, a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. Forward-looking domestic money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are declining even further as inflation rises. In the Council's assessment, there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflation remains moderate for an extended period. The disinflationary impact of the real economy is gradually decreasing over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, the current level of the base rate and maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period are consistent with the medium-term achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy."
Turkiye,2016-08-23,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 8.75 percent to 8.5 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 10.25 percent to 10 percent. Annual loan growth continues at reasonable rates in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Although developments in tourism revenues will have a negative impact in the short run, the lagged effects of the developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans will continue to contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. While domestic demand is having a positive impact on growth, albeit at a lesser extent, demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports. Accordingly, economic activity displays a moderate and stable course of growth. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. The adverse impact of domestic developments in mid-July on market indicators has been largely reversed due to improved global risk appetite and the recent measures. Moreover, the tight monetary policy stance, the cautious macroprudential policies and the effective use of the policy instruments laid out in the road map published in August 2015 have increased the resilience of the economy against shocks. Also considering its contribution to the effectiveness of monetary policy, the Committee decided to take a measured and cautious step towards simplification. Unprocessed food prices, which have recently shown marked increases, are projected to display a downward correction in the short term. Meanwhile, the core inflation trend is expected to improve gradually. Yet, the developments in the inflation outlook necessitate the maintenance of a tight liquidity stance. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2016-08-29,"Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor July increased by 0.4 percent, higher than the average of forecasters' predictions, which was for an increase of 0.2 percent. The fruit and vegetables component increased by 5.7 percent, and the housing component increased by 1.2 percent, while the clothing and footwear component declined by 8.2 percent. The inflation rate as measured by the change in the CPIover the past 12 months was -0.6 percent, compared with -0.8 percent in the 12 months ending in June. Excluding the direct effect of energy prices and administrative price reductions, the CPI increased by 0.8 percent over the past 12 months. Prices of tradable goods in the CPI declined by 3.2 percent over the past 12 months, and the prices of nontradable items increased by 0.8 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: There was no significant change over the month in inflation expectations forthe various ranges. One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market declined from 0.5 percent last month to 0.2 percent, but following the publication of the CPI, they increased, and currently stand at 0.6 percent. Expectations for inflation over the coming 12 months derived from banks' internal interest rates remained at 0.3 percent, and private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings are for an increase of 0.6 percent, on average (compared to 0.8 percent in the previous month). Third-year forward expectations remained virtually unchanged (1.1 percent). Longer term expectations remained within the target range with 3-5 year expectations at 1.4 percent, and 5 C2 AD-10 year expectations at 2.1 percent. Most indicators show that there is no expectation of an increase in the Bank of Israel interest rate in the next year. Real economic activity: The first estimate of second-quarter growth data surprised to the upside. Additionally, significant retroactive revisions were made to National Accounts data. GDP grew by 3.7 percent in the second quarter, and business sector product grew by 3 percent (seasonally adjusted annual data), higher rates than in previousquarters. Private consumption continues to drive growth, increasing by 9.5 percent, and by 7.1 percent excluding personal vehicles. Investment increased by 11.1 percent (though excluding investment in vehicles it contracted by 1.2 percent), and exports increased by 5.7 percent, following several quarters of near-zero growth. Goods exports (excluding ships and aircraft anddiamonds, in current dollar terms) declined by 3.3 percent in July, while manufacturing exports have remained stable at a low level over the past sixmonths. Goods imports (excluding ships and aircraft, diamonds and fuels) remained stable in July, and in recent months an upward trend can be seen in the import of raw materials and capital goods. Business services exports (excluding startups) declined by 4.7 percent in May compared with the January-April average, but there has been a renewed upward trend in the past year. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.2 percentin July, and data for previous months were revised upward, against the background of the revision in growth data. The Consumer Confidence Indices compiled by Bank Hapoalim and by the Central Bureau of Statistics showed improvement in July, with the index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statisticshaving been improving for about a year and a half. The Purchasing ManagersIndex increased slightly in July, and remains around 50 points. The labor market: The picture conveyed by the labor market remains positive. Wage increases continue in all industries, and particularly in the construction industry. Real wages increased by 1.1 percent (seasonally adjusted) in March-May compared with the preceding three months, while nominal wages increased by 0.8 percent. Healthtax receipts for May-July were 5.5 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period in the year before, reflecting the increase in employment and wages. Labor Force Survey data for July indicate that the unemployment rate among the principal working ages (25-64) is 4.0 percent, after declining to a historically low level of 3.9 percent inJune. The employment rate and the labor force participation rate continuedto increase in July. The job vacancy rate increased to a record high of 3.9 percent (seasonally adjusted) in July. Budget data: The state budget for 2017-2018 was approved by the government. The approved budget deficit is 2.9 percent of GDP in each of the years, higher than the rule set by the previous budget, which dictated a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP in 2017 and 2.25 percent in 2018. The cumulative domestic deficit (excluding net credit) in government activity was NIS 1.2 billion in January-July 2016,compared with a surplus of approximately NIS 0.2 billion in the corresponding period of 2015, and it is about NIS 5.7 billion smaller than the deficit in the seasonal path consistent with achieving the deficit target for 2016. The deviation reflects revenues that were NIS 3.9 billion higher than the path, and expenditures that were NIS 1.8 billion lower than the path. Taxrevenues in July were about NIS 26.4 billion, which is about NIS 0.2 billion higher than the seasonal path consistent with the estimate of tax revenue (NIS 277 billion). Tax revenues in January-July were about 5.7 percent higher in real terms than in the corresponding period of the previousyear. Gross domestic VAT collection increased by about 1.4 percent in realterms compared with July of 2015 (it increased by about 7.4 percent net ofthe effect of legislative changes). The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on July 24, 2016, through August 26, 2016, the shekel strengthened by 2.2 percent against the dollar, and by 1.1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the preceding 12 months, the shekel appreciated by 5.1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on July 24, 2016, through August 26, 2016, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 1 percent. Government bond yields increased by up to 5 basis points along the unindexed curve, and by up to 10 basis points along the CPI-indexed curve. The makam curve traded at a yield ranging around the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, remained at about 75 basis points. The money supply: In the 12 months ending in July, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 23.3 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 12.5 percent. The credit market: In July, the businesssector (excluding banks, insurance companies and foreign companies) issuedbonds totaling NIS 4.9 billion, after issuances of NIS 2 billion in June. The average monthly issuance in the past year was about NIS 3 billion. Funds specializing in corporate bonds in Israel and funds specializing in equities in Israel continued to attract net new investment in July and the beginning of August. Since March, funds specializing in corporate bonds in Israel recorded net new investment of about NIS 3 billion, and those specializing in equities in Israel recorded net new investment of about NIS 1 billion.Corporate bond spreads (excluding banks and insurance companies) continuedto decline, over the full month, in most industries, and were about 3 percentage points, on average, at the beginning of August: the lowest level in the past two years. In July, which typically has a seasonally high level of new mortgages taken out, the total volume of new mortgages taken out was NIS 5.4 billion, slightly higher than the average of the past 12 months (NIS 5.1 billion). The share of mortgages taken out for the purchase of investment homes continues to decline, to 13.7 percent in July, compared with an average of 14.7 percent in the past 12 months. The average interest rate on mortgages continued to increase in July on all tracks: On the fixed-rate CPI-indexed track, rates increased by 0.22 percentage points, while onthe variable-rate CPI-indexed track, rates increased by 0.11 percentage points. Rates on the fixed-rate unindexed track increased by 0.16 percentage points, and on the variable-rate unindexed track rates increased by 0.07 percentage points. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 1.2 percent in July,following three months of moderate increases (0-0.2 percent). The increase is, for the most part, seasonal. Home prices declined by 0.3 percent in May-June, following eight consecutive months of increases, while figures on the increases in previous months were revised upward. In the 12 months ending in May-June, home prices increased by 6.9 percent, lower than the increase of about 8 percent in the 12 months ending in May. Activity in the market remains robust, with about 8,900 transactions carried out in June, higher than the average over the past 12 months (about 7,800 transactions per month). New home sales declined moderately in June, to about 2,600 (seasonally adjusted), and the stock of homes available for sale remained high, at approximately 28,300 homes in June. The global economy: The global economy continues to grow moderately, and investment houses' growth forecasts continue to be revised downward. With that, there are no signs so far that the Brexit decision is impacting on activity. World trade increased at a monthly rate of 0.7 percent in June, after declining in May. Major central banks continue accommodative monetary policy. The Bank of England reduced its interest rate, as expected, to 0.25 percent, and adopted several additional accommodative measures. In Japan, the share purchase program was expanded. The central banks of Australia and New Zealand reduced their interest rates. The probability of the US Federal Reserve raising the federal funds rate in 2016 increased this month, against the background of the Fed Chair's remarks at the end of last week noting that 'the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months'. Prices continued to increase in most stock markets, particularlyin the emerging markets. In the US, second quarter growth of 1.1 percent was disappointing, against the background of a decline in inventories and infixed capital formation, while personal consumption expenditure continues to drive the economy. The GDPNow Index indicates that growth is expected toimprove in the third quarter. In the labor market, the increase in the number of jobs continues. In the real estate industry, the increases in activity and in prices continue. In Europe, there was growth of 0.3 percent in the second quarter (quarterly data) compared with 0.6 percent in the first quarter. Various indices of sentiment in Europe were positive. In the UK, retail sales surprised to the upside in July, but sentiment indices strengthenthe assessment that a significant slowdown is expected following the Brexit decision. In Japan, the economy slowed in the second quarter, with growthof only 0.2 percent in annual terms, compared to 2 percent in the first quarter. In addition to the monetary policy measures noted above, the Japanese government announced a broad fiscal program. There are signs of recovery in some of the emerging markets, among other things against the background of stability in commodity prices and the weakening of the dollar. In China,the signs of moderation in economic activity continue, against the background of the long-term structural change the economy is undergoing. The indexof commodities excluding energy was virtually unchanged this month. The price of a barrel of Brent Sea crude oil declined at the beginning of the month, but then resumed its increase, to around $50. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for September 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel'smonetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target range of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The Monetary Committee continues to assess that in view of the inflation environment, and of developments in growth in Israel and in the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time. Following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. C 2B 7 The Consumer Price Index for July increased more than expected, following three successive positive CPI rates of change. Short-term inflation expectations remained low this month, and are still below the lower bound of the inflation target range. Medium and long-term expectations remain anchored within the target range. C 2B 7 In the first half of 2016, the economy grew by 2.9 percent, similar to the average growth rate of recent years. In the second quarter, based on the first estimate of National Accounts data, growth was higher than expected, at 3.7 percent. However, it is too early to establish if this rate, which is higher thanthe recent years' average, will be sustained. Private consumption continues to drive growth, supported by the increase in wages and by accommodative monetary policy. Exports increased at an adequate rate, although itstill lags world trade growth. The picture conveyed by labor market data remains positive, and there are signs that the economy is nearing full employment. C 2B 7 The global economy continues to grow at a moderate rate. Second quarter growth data for major economies were low, and weakness continues inworld trade. Monetary policy is very accommodative in Europe. Japan, and the UK, and additional central banks reduced interest rates this month. In the US, there was an increase in the probability that the federal funds ratewill be raised this year, though the uncertainly surrounding it is still high. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on July 24, 2016, through August 26, 2016, the shekel strengthened by 2.2 percent against the dollar. In terms of the effective exchange rate, the shekel appreciated by 1.1 percent, and has appreciated by 5.1 percent over the past 12 months. The level of the effective exchange rate continues to weigh on the growth of exports and of the tradable sector. C 2B 7 Although the most recent observation indicated a decline inprices, the rate of increase in home prices remains elevated, and the levels of transactions and mortgage volumes remain high. The stock of homes forsale continues to be high. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to achieving the inflation target remain high. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of pricestability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for thestability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housingmarket. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for September 2016 will be published on September 12, 2016. The decision regarding the interest rate for October 2016 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. September 26, 2016."
Brazil,2016-08-31,"The Copom released the following note to the public&#58. The Copom released the following note to the public:. ""201st Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (=9CCopom=9D) of the Central Bank of Brazil Press Release*. The Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 14.25 percent per year, without bias. The set of indicators released since the last Copom meeting shows evidence that the Brazilian economy has stabilized recently. It also points to the possibility of a gradual pick-up in economic activity. The economy continues to operate with a high level of economic slack. The external outlook still offers a relatively benign environment for emerging economies. However, uncertainties regarding global economic growth and, especially, the pace of monetary policy normalization in the United States, remain. Current inflation remains under pressure, partly due to food components. Disinflation has evolved more slowly than expected. Inflation expectations collected by the Focus survey for 2017 fell since the last Copom meeting, but remain above the 4.5% inflation target. At longer horizons, expectations have dropped to around that level; and. The Committees inflation forecasts for 2016 in the reference and market scenarios increased since the last meeting, to approximately 7.3%. Inflation forecasts over the relevant horizons for the conduct of monetary policy have either remained relatively stable or decreased. In particular, under the assumptions of the reference scenario, 2017 inflation is projected at around the target of 4.5%. Under the assumptions of the market scenario, the forecast for 2017 inflation fell to 5.1%. The Committee identifies the following domestic risks to the baseline scenario for inflation:. On the one hand, higher-than-expected inflation in the short term, largely due to food prices, may show persistence; uncertainties regarding the approval and implementation of the necessary adjustments in the economy remain; and a prolonged period with high inflation and above-target expectations can strengthen inertial mechanisms and delay the disinflation process. On the other hand, wholesale price indices point to the possibility of the shock to food prices fading, with favorable impacts on IPCA inflation; the adjustments in the economy can be implemented more quickly, allowing confidence gains and reducing inflation expectations; and the level of economic slack may lead to disinflation at a faster pace than the one reflected in the Copom projections. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the current balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 14.25 percent per year, without bias. The Committee judges that a loosening of monetary conditions will depend on factors that allow greater confidence on meeting the inflation targets at the relevant horizons for the conduct of monetary policy, in particular the 4.5% target for 2017. The Committee emphasizes the following domestic factors: that the persistence of the impacts of the food price shock on inflation be limited; that IPCA components that are most sensitive to monetary policy and economic slack show disinflation at an appropriate pace; that the uncertainty regarding the approval and implementation of the necessary economic adjustments be reduced, including the composition of fiscal measures, and their effects on inflation. The Committee will assess the evolution of the combination of such factors. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Anthero de Moraes Meirelles. Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira. Luiz Edson Feltrim. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Reinaldo Le Grazie. Sidnei Corr=AAa Marques and Tiago Couto Berriel.""."
Colombia,2016-08-31,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 7.75%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In July, annual consumer inflation and the average of core inflation indicators increased, reaching 8.97% and 6.61%, respectively. Analysts' inflation expectations to one and two years remained stable, posting at 4.6% and 3.7%, respectively, and those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years lowered within a range of 3.8% and 4.4%. The lagged effects of El Nino, the high depreciation in the past and its partial pass-through to consumer prices, and the activation of some indexation mechanisms explain to a large extent the difference between inflation and its target. In the following months, normalization of weather conditions and agricultural supply must generate drops in the prices of food, especially of perishable items. Global economic activity remains weak and it is likely that the average growth of Colombia's trading partners for 2016 be low and less than estimated a month ago. As for the United States, a slow tightening of monetary policy is still projected. The price of oil remains above the levels recorded at the beginning of the year, and the prices of some international commodities imported by Colombia have fallen. With this, the terms of trade have increased, but remain at low levels, lower than the average observed in 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, the Colombian economy grew 2.0% annually, a figure lower than the central forecast by the technical staff at the Central Bank (2.6%). The most dynamic sectors were industry and financial services, while mining, agriculture and electricity, gas and water utilities reported declines in their production. These figures, together with the new records of economic activity for the third quarter, suggest a downward bias to the growth projection for 2016. Foreign trade figures for the second quarter suggest that the external deficit narrowed. The technical staff continues forecasting a current account deficit of US 15 billion in 2016, equivalent to 5.3% of GDP, lower than initially forecast. In all, the Colombian economy continues to adjust to the strong shocks recorded since 2014, and the current account deficit is narrowing gradually. The dynamism of output has been weaker than projected, and inflation and its expectations remain high, exceeding the target. The effects of transitory supply shocks that have affected inflation and its expectations are expected to begin reversing in the following months. This, together with the monetary policy actions taken so far, should lead inflation to its target range in 2017. In this environment, after assessing the risk balance for inflation and growth, the Board of Directors deemed appropriate to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered. New data on the behavior of prices and aggregate demand will provide more information about the speed of the expected convergence of inflation to the target, and the intensity, nature, and persistence of the economic slowdown. The Board will continue to monitor the adjustment of expenditure and its consistency with the long-term income level, the sustainability of the external deficit, and, in general, macroeconomic stability. Similarly, it reaffirms its commitment to maintain inflation and its expectations anchored to the target, acknowledging that there has been a transitory increase in inflation. The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered was approved by six members of the Board; one member voted for a 25 basis points increase. The voting balance in each meeting of the Board will continue to be revealed in the corresponding press release. Bogot."
India,2016-08-31,"Summary of the Electronic Consultation with the Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy: August 2016 Consultation with external Members of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Monetary Policy was held electronically during July 27 to August 1, 2016 in the run up to the third bi-monthly monetary policy review, 2016-17 on August 9, 2016. The main points made by Members are summarised below. Members expressed concern on the lacklustre global economic environment. In the US. GDP growth in Q2 of 2016 was much below expectations and Q1 GDP was revised downwards. The Eurozone is facing a mounting crisis that combines the fear of the economic consequences of the Brexit vote to leave the EU and a weaker growth outlook. The Bank of Japan has kept its key monetary policy tools unchanged, expanded its purchases of exchange traded funds, and will mount a comprehensive review of its policy framework in reaction to heightened uncertainty on the economic outlook. Among emerging market economies, growth continued to be sluggish in China. On the domestic front, industrial production remains subdued with volume based indicators at the plant level (index of industrial production) and value based indicators at the establishment level (gross value added) continuing to diverge. Overall private investment demand continues to be lacklustre for a variety of reasons, and public investment accounts for a small share of total gross fixed capital formation in the economy. On the positive side, although global conditions continue to be fragile, stabilising commodity prices may be contributing to the uptick in India's exports. This, together with a good monsoon and the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) awards, can provide a boost to aggregate demand. Members found headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation to be sticky with a tendency to increase. One member noted that while food inflation has increased over the past couple of months  largely driven by pulses and vegetables  it seems to be ring-fenced, and has not become generalised. Excluding pulses. CPI inflation appears to be moderate. Members took comfort in the fact that there has been a marginal reduction in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel, suggesting that demand pressures are not impinging on the overall resource constraints of the economy. The monsoon has also been normal so far, although the targeted pulses production  pulses being a major driver of food inflation  will also likely be driven by higher minimum support prices in this sector. Members felt that increased upside risks to the 5 per cent CPI inflation target in Q4 of 2016-17 remain, specifically, from rising consumption demand  both private (because of a consumption led recovery) and public (one rank one pension; 7th CPC)  and cost-push shocks in the form of a steady rise in crude prices.2 4. On the external sector, the sustainability of the pick-up in exports in June needs to be ascertained given that global conditions are still fragile. Indian financial markets have weathered recent risk-off events  Brexit; the Chinese devaluation; re-balancing of the Chinese economy  well. The external sector outlook is, by and large, robust. The current account deficit (CAD) in Q4 of 2015-16 was the narrowest in nearly a decade. With a comfortable CAD and robust net foreign direct investment inflows, the downside risks from sudden stops to portfolio inflows would be mitigated. The rupee has also been stable, but it needs to be insulated from global shocks, with a bias towards depreciation. For the third bi-monthly monetary policy statement, four of the five Members recommended status quo. These Members were of the view that CPI and CPI-food inflation have seen a recent uptick and certain other price indicators continue to be sticky; elevated food inflation has second round effects on headline inflation if it is persistently above double digits; although industrial growth remains weak, the improvement in liquidity conditions should help banks pass through past policy rate cuts; implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) poses an upside risk to inflation; inflation excluding food and fuel shows some signs of the anchoring of inflation expectations that needs to be further strengthened by keeping the policy rates unchanged; and the real policy rate continues to be below the natural rate and there is no space for accommodation unless there is substantially lower inflation relative to the target of 5 per cent for March 2017 on a durable basis. One Member recommended a reduction in the policy repo rate by 50 basis points. According to this Member, there is a high probability of inflation softening to 4-5 per cent by the year end; and appreciation in the real effective exchange rate and increased interest differential will slow recovery of large corporate. For small and medium firms, however, the Member recommended stepping up in reserve money growth in case it is low relative to the historical average. All the five external Members  Dr.Shankar Acharya. Dr.Arvind Virmani. Prof. Errol D'Souza. Prof. Ashima Goyal, and Prof. Chetan Ghate  sent their feedback through e-mail. Since February 2011, the Reserve Bank has been placing the main points of discussions of the TAC on Monetary Policy in the public domain with a lag of roughly four weeks after the meeting/consultation.

Georgia,2016-09-07,"7.09.16 NBG Reduces Its Policy Rate by 25 basis points to 6.5%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on September 7, 2016 and decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 6.5 percent. The monetary policy decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, according to which the phasing out of tight monetary policy must continue in order for inflation to reach its target value. According to the forecast, other things equal, the monetary policy rate may be expected to decrease to 6% in the medium term. The annual CPI inflation in August dropped to 0.9%, in line with the current forecasts. Expiration of base effect was an important factor causing the inflation to decrease. Weak aggregate demand pushed inflation down as well. According to the current forecast the inflation will remain low in the coming quarters reaching the target by the end of 2017. Improvement in aggregate demand and, as a result, inflation closing on its target, is supported by both the phasing out of the tight monetary policy and fiscal stimulus. The further changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the processes taking place in the economy, possible realization of external sector risks and the magnitude of shock transmission from trade partner countries to Georgian economy. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on October 26, 2016."
Malaysia,2016-09-07,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. Growth across the advanced economies has been modest. In Asia, economic activity has been supported by domestic demand amid weaker export growth. While volatility in the international financial markets has subsided, markets remain vulnerable to setbacks and changes in sentiments. Going forward, downside risks to global growth remain high following uncertainty over the growth momentum and policy shifts in major economies, and unresolved issues post the EU referendum in the United Kingdom. For Malaysia, growth moderated slightly in the second quarter of the year, following weaker net exports and a drawdown in stocks. Domestic demand, however, remained the key driver of growth, with private consumption and private investment growing at a faster pace. Going forward, private consumption will remain supported by wage and employment growth, with additional impetus coming from announced Government measures to increase disposable income. Investment activity will continue to be anchored by the on-going implementation of infrastructure projects and capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors. On the external front, export growth is expected to remain weak following subdued demand from Malaysia's key trading partners. Overall, the economy is projected to expand within expectations in 2016, and to remain on a steady growth path in 2017. Headline inflation moderated to 1.1% in July. Inflation is expected to be at the lower end of the 2 to 3% range for 2016 and to remain relatively stable in 2017 given the environment of low global energy and commodity prices, and generally subdued global inflation. Domestic financial conditions have remained stable since the previous MPC meeting with financial markets continuing to function in an orderly manner. Financial institutions continue to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers and the growth of financing to the private sector is consistent with the pace of economic activity. Banking system liquidity remains ample. At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path amid stable inflation, supported by continued healthy financial intermediation in the economy. The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. Bank Negara Malaysia 07 September 2016."
Poland,2016-09-07,"Warsaw, 7 September 2016 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 6-7 September 2016 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 1.50%;  lombard rate at 2.50%;  deposit rate at 0.50%;  rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic growth remains moderate, but uncertainty remains about its outlook. In the euro area, economic growth is stable despite a negative impact of weak economic conditions in the non-European emerging market economies. In the United States. GDP growth is lower than in previous years, but recent improvement in labour market has eased concerns about persistent deterioration in economic conditions. Recent indicators point to further slowdown in China, while in Russia recession is gradually receding. The prices of oil and many other commodities in the global markets remain lower than in previous years. Along with moderate global economic activity, this is the main factor behind low consumer price growth in many economies. The European Central Bank keeps its interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and continues financial asset purchases. The US Federal Reserve  after a hike in December 2015  keeps the interest rates unchanged, indicating their possible increase in the future. In Poland. GDP growth in 2016 Q2 picked up somewhat. The growth was driven mainly by steady increase in consumer demand, supported by gradual improvement in the labour market, favourable consumer sentiment and the launch of the ”Family 500 plus” programme. Another factor contributing to higher GDP growth in 2016 Q2 was significant acceleration in exports. At the same time. GDP growth was contained by a decline in investment. It was related to a temporary lower EU funds absorption after the previous EU financial framework had expired, as well as uncertainty about the economic outlook. With the negative output gap and moderate  though increasing  nominal wage growth, there is no inflationary pressure in the economy. The annual consumer price growth and producer price growth remain negative. Negative price growth results from external factors, mainly the earlier sharp fall in global commodity prices and the low price growth in the environment of the Polish economy. This is accompanied by low inflation expectations. According to available information, the persisting deflation has not adversely affected decisions taken by economic agents so far. 1/2 In the Council's opinion, the annual consumer price index will remain negative in the coming months. However, deflation will be gradually subsiding due to dissipating effects of low commodity prices in the global markets. In the coming quarters, higher price growth will be supported by stable GDP growth, amid acceleration in wage growth and higher child benefits. Investment should also rise, which will be supported by a gradual increase in EU funds absorption, good financial standing of enterprises and growing capacity utilisation of firms. The sources of uncertainty for expected economic activity and price developments are risks of a deterioration in the global economy and of a fall in commodity prices. The Council confirms its assessment that  given the available data and forecasts  the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance. The Council adopted Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2017."
Euroarea,2016-09-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that the monthly asset purchases of €80 billion are intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. Today, we assessed the economic and monetary data which had become available since our last meeting and discussed the new ECB staff macroeconomic projections. Overall, while the available evidence so far suggests resilience of the euro area economy to the continuing global economic and political uncertainty, our baseline scenario remains subject to downside risks. Our comprehensive policy measures continue to ensure supportive financing conditions and underpin the momentum of the euro area economic recovery. As a result, we continue to expect real GDP to grow at a moderate but steady pace and euro area inflation to rise gradually over the coming months, in line with the path already implied in our June 2016 staff projections. The Governing Council will continue to monitor economic and financial market developments very closely. We will preserve the very substantial amount of monetary support that is embedded in our staff projections and that is necessary to secure a return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. If warranted, we will act by using all the instruments available within our mandate. Meanwhile, the Governing Council tasked the relevant committees to evaluate the options that ensure a smooth implementation of our purchase programme. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2016, after 0.5% in the first quarter. Incoming data point to ongoing growth in the third quarter of 2016, at around the same rate as in the second quarter. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the economic recovery to proceed at a moderate but steady pace. Domestic demand remains supported by the pass-through of our monetary policy measures to the real economy. Favourable financing conditions and improvements in the demand outlook and in corporate profitability continue to promote a recovery in investment. Sustained employment gains, which are also benefiting from past structural reforms, and still relatively low oil prices provide additional support for households' real disposable income and thus for private consumption. In addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is expected to be mildly expansionary in 2016 and to turn broadly neutral in 2017 and 2018. However, the economic recovery in the euro area is expected to be dampened by still subdued foreign demand, partly related to the uncertainties following the UK referendum outcome, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. The risks to the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside and relate mainly to the external environment. This assessment is broadly reflected in the September 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.7% in 2016, by 1.6% in 2017 and by 1.6% in 2018. Compared with the June 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised downwards slightly. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation in August 2016 was 0.2%, unchanged from July. While annual energy inflation continued to rise, services and non-energy industrial goods inflation turned out to be slightly lower than in July. Looking ahead, on the basis of current oil futures prices, inflation rates are likely to remain low over the next few months before starting to pick up towards the end of 2016, in large part owing to base effects in the annual rate of change of energy prices. Supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should increase further in 2017 and 2018. This pattern is also reflected in the September 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 0.2% in 2016, 1.2% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018. In comparison with the June 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation is broadly unchanged. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continued to increase at a robust pace in July 2016, with its annual rate of growth standing at 4.8%, after 5.0% in June. As in previous months, annual growth in M3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 expanding at an annual rate of 8.4% in July, after 8.7% in June. Loan dynamics followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 1.9% in July 2016, compared with 1.7% in June. The annual growth rate of loans to households remained stable at 1.8% in July. Although developments in bank credit continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, the monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 are increasingly filtering through to support borrowing conditions for firms and households and thereby credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need to preserve the very substantial amount of monetary support that is necessary in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. As emphasised repeatedly by the Governing Council, and as strongly echoed in both European and international policy discussions, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the European level. The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up to reduce structural unemployment and boost potential output growth in the euro area. The focus should be on actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, which are vital to increase investment and boost job creation. The enhancement of current investment initiatives, including the extension of the Juncker plan, progress on the capital markets union and reforms that will improve the resolution of non-performing loans will also contribute positively to this objective. In an environment of accommodative monetary policy, the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also make the euro area more resilient to global shocks. Fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. Full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact over time and across countries remains crucial to ensure confidence in the fiscal framework. At the same time, all countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies."
South Korea,2016-09-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that the Chinese economy has maintained its moderate pace of growth. However, the improvements in the euro area have remained weak. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, while being affected by factors including changes in the monetary policies of major countries such as the US, the uncertainties related to Britain's exit from the European Union, and economic conditions in emerging market countries. Looking at the Korean economy, exports have increased slightly on the effects of transitory factors, and domestic demand activities appear to have continued their improvements while the sentiments of economic agents have improved somewhat. On the employment front, as the number of persons employed has increased, the employment-to-population ratio rose and the unemployment rate fell in July compared to those in July of last year. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of modest growth going forward, owing chiefly to expansionary macroeconomic policies, but in view of economic conditions domestically and abroad judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high. Consumer price inflation fell from 0.7% the month before to 0.4% in August, owing chiefly to the effect of a temporary cut in electricity fees. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also declined to 1.1%, from 1.6% in July. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have continued. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will remain at a low level for the time being, and then gradually rise due to the disappearance of the effect of the temporary electricity fee reduction and the weakening influence of the low oil prices. In the domestic financial markets since August, stock prices have risen as foreigners' stock investment funds have recorded net inflows in line with continued risk-taking tendencies globally. Long-term market interest rates and the Korean won-US dollar and Korean won-Japanese yen exchange rates have fallen, after having previously risen, affected mainly by changes in the expectations of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. Household lending has sustained a trend of substantial increase at a level exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in household debt, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and the progress of corporate restructuring."
Thailand,2016-09-14,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 14 September 2016 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 14 September 2016 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed the economy to continue recovering at a gradual pace, while facing uncertainties on both domestic and external fronts. Inflation was expected to return to the target band within the latter half of the year. Meanwhile monetary conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery. Hence the Committee judged that the policy rate should be kept on hold at this meeting. The Thai economy recorded higher-than-expected growth in the second quarter on the back of a strong expansion in private consumption, partly as a result of temporary factors and government stimulus measures. Meanwhile public expenditure and tourism continued to be the key growth drivers. Nonetheless private investment remained low and mostly concentrated in some business sectors. Manufacturing production and merchandise exports contracted due to the slowdown in Asian economies and structural problems facing the Thai economy. In addition, there was a decline in the quality of loans extended to some business sectors. Looking ahead, the Committee projected that the Thai economy would continue to recover but face risks, particularly those stemming from the fragile global economic recovery and political developments abroad. Headline inflation in August increased slightly on account of fresh food prices, while core inflation remained stable in line with the gradual recovery in demand. The Committee expected headline inflation to return to the target band within this year as previously assessed. Overall monetary conditions remained accommodative as reflected in low real interest rates and government bond yields. Nonetheless the baht appreciated against key trading partner currencies over some recent periods which might not be beneficial to the ongoing economic recovery. In addition, financial stability risks from the prolonged low interest rate environment, including search-for-yield behavior, continued to warrant close monitoring. The Committee saw the need to preserve policy space given that the Thai economy would still be facing greater uncertainties going forward, particularly the fragile global economic recovery and uncertainties in the monetary policy directions of major advanced economies that might induce greater capital flow and exchange rate volatility. Going forward, the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative, and stands ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to ensure that monetary conditions are conducive to the economic recovery, while ensuring financial stability."
Chile,2016-09-15,"Santiago. Chile. Thursday, 15 September 2016 Monetary Policy Meeting  September 2016 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3.5%. Internationally, the movements of the financial markets have been dominated by the prospect of what the Federal Reserve will do at its meeting next week. Anyway, despite some volatility, monetary and financial conditions are still favorable and long-term interest rates remain low. On the activity side, the weakness of recent indicators in the United States and the improvement of Chinese figures stand out. Beyond fluctuations, the prices of copper and oil are similar to those of a month ago. On the domestic front, annual CPI inflation dropped to 3.4%, in line with forecasts. Expected inflation two years ahead remains at 3%. Partial third-quarter data point at limited growth in output and demand, consistent with the Monetary Policy Report's baseline scenario. Confidence indicators are still in pessimistic territory. The labor market continues to reflect a gradual deterioration, with a slightly higher unemployment rate. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2016-09-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2016 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.25 percent. The Board has taken this decision considering that: Inflation expectations continue to reverse gradually; The effects of the rise in the prices of some food products and utilities as well as the effects of the exchange rate on inflation have been reversing; Local economic activity has been showing a pace of growth close to its potential growth level, and The global economy continues showing mixed signals of recovery in terms of production and employment, as well as lower volatility in financial markets. The Board oversees new data on inflation and inflation determinants in the forecast horizon to evaluate the convenience of making additional adjustments in the monetary policy rate. Inflation is expected to remain within the upper band of the inflation target range in the next months and to continue showing a downward trend in 2017, the rate of inflation at end-2017 being estimated at 2.0 percent. Inflation in August showed a rate of 0.36 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate of inflation has continued falling, declining from 2.96 percent in July to 2.94 in August. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.17 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate rose from 2.87 percent to 2.96 percent. Inflation expectations have continued to decrease and show a declining path, which is within the target range in the following years. Indicators of business expectations have improved for the third consecutive month and all of them remain on the optimistic side. In line with this. GDP is expected to grow 3.7 percent in 2016 and 4.2 percent in 2017. However, the indicators associated with construcion and manufacturing have declined in the past two months due to the weakness of investment. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for October on October 13, 2016."
Ukraine,2016-09-15,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the key policy rate to 15%, effective from 16 September 2016. Monetary policy easing was due to further alleviation of risks to price stability, which is consistent with inflation targets set at 12% +/-3% for 2016 and 8% +/-2% for 2017. Consumer prices dynamics during last months kept pace with the forecast appeared in the July 2016 Inflation Report. Therefore, inflation made 8.4% y-o-y in August. Pressure on inflation driven by fundamental factors continued to ease. This is evidenced by further slower core inflation to 7.4% y-o-y. As originally purposed, it was due to low aggregate demand, large supply of food products and restrained monetary policy. Apart from this, inflation expectations also further improved both for households, business and expert community. Economic activity gradually keeps on recovering: GDP growth accelerated to 1.3% y-o-y in Q2. Higher Index of Key Sectors Output (IKSO) remained set to 1.7% y-o-y in July. At the same time by estimates of the NBU, private consumption contribution to economic growth remained low and did not generate additional pressure on inflation despite high growth of real wages during the last months. Inflation will approach the level of 12% y-o-y in Q4 2016. Mainly, it will take place due to reflection of higher tariffs for public utilities in statistics. Core inflation will continue to moderate by showing further weaker fundamental pressure on inflation, according to the NBU estimates. Higher volatility of exchange rate, which took place in August-September, did not create risk for inflation to exceed targets (12% +/-3% for 2016 and 8% +/-2% for 2017). As before. NBU did not impair dominant trends in FX market and smoothed out sharp exchange rate fluctuations through FX interventions, at the same time. Completion of the second programme review under the Extended Arrangement will become an important factor for improvement of expectations, source of financing for country and a sign for both national and external investors that our country is on the right way to recovery of sustainable economic growth. Also, larger exports of grain and other agricultural crops due to high yield will set off recent decline in global markets prices. But in the view of uncertainty as to external market situation, the NBU maintains sufficiently restrained monetary conditions. In the event of a further risks mitigation for price stability the NBU will continue easing the monetary policy to support economic growth recovery. The decision to cut the key policy rate to 15% is approved by NBU Board Decision No. 277-рш, dated 15 September 2016. On the Key Policy Rate. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held as scheduled on 27 October 2016."
Russia,2016-09-16,"On 16 September 2016, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to reduce the key ratefrom 10.50 to 10.00% p.a. given the inflation slowdown, in line with the forecast, decrease in inflation expectations and unstable economic activity. However, for the trend towards sustainable decline in inflation to strengthen, according to the Bank of Russia's estimates, the current value of the key rate needs to be maintained till end-2016 with its further possible cuts in 2017 Q1-Q2. Considering the decision made and persistent moderately tight monetary policy, the annual consumer price growth will stand at 4.5% in September 2017 and will then go down to the 4% target in late 2017. When making its key rate decisions in the coming months, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks alongside economy and inflation dynamics' consistence with the baseline forecast. In making the key rate decision, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors was guided by the following considerations:. First. Inflation has demonstrated a noticeable decline in line with the Bank of Russia's baseline forecast. By estimates, the annual consumer price growth fell to 6.6% as of 12 September 2016 compared to 7.2% in July. However, the inflation slowdown was specifically shaped by the ruble dynamics amid more favourable external economic environment than expected earlier. The reluctant slowing in non-food goods price growth observed at this juncture signals the weakening in the disinflationary effects on the part of the domestic demand. Over recent months, seasonally smoothed indicators of consumer price monthly growth remained elevated. Keeping the key rate at 10.00 % p.a. during a rather long period of time will shape monetary conditions conducive for the trend towards a further persistent slowdown in inflation under the influence of demand-side constraints. Ruble stabilisation and the good harvest outlook will also contribute to lowering consumer price growth. This will install conditions for a further drop in inflation expectations. Considering the decision made and persistent moderately tight monetary policy, the annual inflation, as forecast by the Bank of Russia, will be around 4.5% in September 2017 to reach the 4% target by late 2017. Second. The Bank of Russia expects that the decision made and maintenance of the key rate at the level it reached will bring down inflation expectations. At present, the structure of market interest rates by maturity and survey findings indicate that, in contrast to the Bank of Russia, market players forecast a faster drop in interest rates. Additionally, their end-2017 inflation forecasts exceed the 4% target of the central bank. In reality, the decrease of nominal rates has a limited capacity, and the economy will maintain moderately tight monetary conditions for quite a long period of time. This is implied by the need to keep positive real interest rates at the level supporting demand for credit that does not raise inflationary pressure and keeps incentives for saving. Third. Persistent revival in production activity is still unstable and patchy across industries and regions. According to Bank of Russia estimates, the moderately tight monetary conditions do not hamper recovery in economy, whereas the main obstacles are caused by structural effects. The labour market tries to adjust to new economic conditions, and the unemployment remains stable and low. Import substitution steps up and non-commodity exports expand for certain items. Industry, including technology-intensive production types, discovers new opportunities for growth. Nonetheless, they fail to ensure an overall robust positive production dynamics. At the same time, certain industries stagnate or show slowdown in output growth, while investment continues to contract. More time is needed for positive trends to develop and get rooted. Positive quarterly GDP growth is possible in the second half of this year, however in 2017. GDP growth will not be high, staying below 1%. This forecast is based on the conservative assumptions of sluggish growth in global economy, average annual oil price staying around $40 per barrel and persistent structural constraints for the Russian economic development. Fourth. The risks of failure to deliver the inflation at the 4% target in 2017 persist mainly due to the inertia of inflation expectations and potential weaker household saving motives. Specific fiscal consolidation measures, including wage and social payments indexation, remain uncertain over the mid-term horizon. Volatility in global commodity and financial markets may produce a negative impact on exchange rate and inflation expectations. According to Bank of Russia estimates, to strengthen the trend to a steady decline in inflation the current key rate needs to be maintained till end-2016 with a possibility to cut it in 2017 Q1-Q2. Within the next months, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks and economy and inflation dynamics' consistence with the baseline forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 28 October 2016. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board's decision is to be published at 13.30 Moscow time.

Hungary,2016-09-20,"At its meeting on 20 September 2016, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 21 September 2016:. In the Council's assessment. Hungarian economic growth will continue to pick up in the remaining part of the year following the temporary slowdown at the beginning of the year. There continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflation remains persistently below the Bank's target. Looking ahead, the disinflationary impact of the domestic real economic environment is gradually decreasing. In August 2016, consumer prices were slightly lower than a year earlier. Core inflation decreased somewhat relative to the previous month. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation continue to indicate a moderate inflationary environment in the economy. Inflation is expected to rise gradually into positive range in the coming months. Persistently low global inflation is restraining the pace of increase in domestic consumer prices. Inflation expectations are at historically low levels. Whole-economy wage growth remains strong, which is likely to raise core inflation gradually through rising household consumption. Inflation remains below the 3 per cent target over the forecast period, and only gets close to it by the middle of 2018. Hungarian economic growth picked up again in the second quarter of 2016, in line with the Bank's expectations. Growth has been supported primarily by final consumption and net exports and, on the output side, by growing services driven by the pick-up in domestic demand as well as by the correction in industrial and agricultural performance. Whole-economy investment continued to decrease relative to the same period a year earlier, mainly as a consequence of the decline in government investments financed by EU funds. Household consumption is expected to grow further in the coming quarters. Industrial production fell in July relative to the same period a year earlier, caused by the longer factory shutdowns in the summer in various manufacturing sub-sectors. Labour demand remained strong, and therefore the number of employees increased again, while the unemployment rate remained at a low level. The time profile of this year's economic growth is characterised by duality. The economy picks up following temporary slow growth at the beginning of the year, mainly supported by domestic demand. Economic growth of around 3 per cent can be achieved overall by the extension of the Funding for Growth Scheme, the Growth Supporting Programme, the easing steps of monetary policy as well as the Government's measures. Moderate growth early this year has resulted in a more negative output gap temporarily; however, the acceleration in growth and the expansionary impact on demand of next year's fiscal budget contribute to the closure of the gap. Rising incomes and the pick-up in lending are contributing to the expansion in household consumption, which in turn strongly promotes economic growth in the coming years. Sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile since the Council's latest interest rate-setting decision, mainly driven by the release of macroeconomic data in the US and the euro area as well as by expectations about further actions by the world's leading central banks. Short and medium-term domestic government securities yields and interbank rates fell sharply since July in response to the Council's earlier announcement about the change to monetary policy instruments. But they have remained broadly unchanged in the weeks since the previous policy decision, while the forint exchange rate remained stable. Hungary's strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. These factors have also contributed significantly to the fact that the S&P  as the second of the large credit rating agencies  has upgraded Hungary's debt rating back to investment grade. Forward-looking domestic money market real interest rates are in negative range and are declining even further as inflation rises. However, in the Council's assessment, a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. At today's meeting, the Monetary Council set a HUF 900 billion upper limit on 2016 year-end stock of three-month central bank deposits. Following the decision, according to the expectations of the Monetary Council at least HUF 200400 billion liquidity will be crowded out from the facility. The Council considers the limit on the three-month deposit stock and its potential future change an integral part of monetary policy instruments. On the next occasion, a decision on it's level as at end of the first quarter of 2017 will be made in December 2016. With this limitation the central bank achieves the loosening of monetary conditions and also the corresponding support to economic growth through a decline in the money market rates. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank closely monitors developments in monetary conditions and markets. In the Council's assessment, there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflation remains moderate for an extended period. The disinflationary impact of the real economy is gradually decreasing over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, maintaining the current level of the base rate for an extended period, and the loosening of monetary conditions by the limitation of the deposit facility are consistent with the medium-term achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. If subsequently it is warranted to loosen the monetary conditions further to meet the inflation target, the Monetary Council will stand ready to apply a stronger limitation to three-month deposits."
Israel,2016-09-20,"Aspublished by the Bank of Israel on July 28, 2016, the Monetary Committee examined the frequency of making decisions on the interest rate in Israel. After several discussions that were held on the issue, the Committee decidedto switch during the course of 2017 from the current frequency of 12 decisions yearly to a frequency of 8 decisions yearly. The considerations that arose in the Committee's discussions, as wellas the advantages and disadvantages of the decision, are detailed extensively in the summary of the Committee's discussions, which is being published together with this notice. Inthe coming weeks, the Bank of Israel will publicize the precise date on which the change will be implemented, and will publish the schedule of interest rate decision dates for 2017. To Summary of the Monetary Committee discussion."
Nigeria,2016-09-20,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No 109 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of Monday and th th Tuesday 19 and 20 September 2016 th th The Monetary Policy Committee met on 19 and 20 September 2016, amidst persistently subdued global and domestic economic and financial environments. The Committee thoroughly assessed the global and domestic macroeconomic and financial developments and risks to the domestic economy up to September 2016, and the outlook for the last quarter of the year. In attendance were 10 out of 12 members. International Economic Developments The Committee acknowledged the tepid growth performance of global output, arising from legacy rd factors, the June 23 Brexit vote as well as contagion from emerging markets' weak demand and contracting productivity. Whereas growth appears to be slowly recovering in advanced economies, especially the United States, the outlook remains fraught with uncertainty as long-term government bonds have nosedived to multi-year lows on expectations of loose monetary policy from advanced economies and the continued sub-optimal performance of the Euro Area. Japan and China. Consequently the IMF had in July 2016, further downgraded its baseline forecast for 2 global growth to 31 per cent from 32 in April. The World Bank in its June 2016 Report on Global Economic Prospects showed even less optimism with a global output growth projection of 24 per cent for 2016 from the 29 per cent in January. The subdued global growth prospects is traced to persistently weak fundamentals, mainly in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), mostly due to soft commodity prices, diminished investment, contracting trade, weak demand and rising inflation. Volatility in global financial markets appeared to have subsided in the second quarter of the year, after a wild ride following the UK Brexit vote, and against the backdrop 3 of less likely US rate hike expectations and some stability in the crude oil market. The United States (US) economy firmed up at a seasonally-adjusted annualized rate of 11 per cent in Q2 2016, although with a downward adjustment of 01 per cent from the first estimate of 12 per cent. It however, still represents a noticeable improvement compared with the 08 per cent growth recorded in Q1 2016. The improved performance of the economy was attributed to increased private consumption spending, a robust labor market and increased exports, even as retail sales and manufacturing output declined. Japan's economy expanded at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 02 per cent in Q2 2016 compared 4 with 17 per cent in Q1 of 2016, against the backdrop of weak wage growth and an external sector that is undermined by a strong yen. Fearing that monetary policy may be approaching its limits, the government nd on 2 August, approved a fiscal stimulus of ¥135 trillion (US$132 billion) in a spirited attempt to jumpstart the economy, even as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) dismissed market speculation that it was planning to stop its monthly monetary stimulus program of ¥67 trillion ($6907 billion). The massive fiscal and monetary stimuli are, however, yet to have the desired impact. Real GDP in the Euro area expanded by 03 per cent, a significant decline compared with the 06 per cent 5 recorded in Q1 2016. Downside risks from the Brexit vote seems to have dissipated with no attendant major economic shock to the zone's economy thus far. As such, many of the conditions that had driven the recovery remained in place, suggesting that Q3 growth may continue in the direction of the second quarter. th Following its September 8 , 2016 meeting, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank resolved to leave its key interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 000, 025 and - 040 per cent, respectively. The Council also reaffirmed its commitment to sustain the monthly asset purchases of €80 billion (US$904 billion) until end of 6 March 2017 or until a sustained adjustment is seen on the path of inflation, towards the 20 per cent policy target. th The Bank of England (BoE), at its August 4 meeting, and in attempts to further blunt the aftershocks of the Brexit vote, decided to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2009, by 25 basis points from 05 per cent to 025 per cent, the lowest ever in the Bank's history. The Committee voted to increase its monthly assets purchase program financed through the issuance of reserves by another ₤60 billion (US$804 billion) from ₤375 billion (US$5025 billion) to ₤435 billion (US$5829 billion). Furthermore the BoE revived its financial crises-era UK. government 7 bond buying program financed through the issuance of reserves, up to ₤10 billion ($134 billion), in effort to stimulate the economy and steer inflation towards its 20 per cent target. While major EMDEs continue to be constrained by low capital inflow, the intractable macroeconomic environment faced in 2015 and through to the first half of this year is gradually abating. The prospects for near term full economic and financial recovery in the EMDEs remain subdued, with the IMF (WEO July 2016 Update) projected growth rate forecast for this group of countries at 41 per cent, a downward review from 43 projected in April. However the resumption of 8 growth is expected to be powered by rising credits and a surge in government spending. The potential alliance between OPEC and non-OPEC members like Russia, to reduce quota, in the face of disruptions to production in Nigeria. Libya and Iraq, have aided relative stability in the crude oil market. Globally general price levels remained tapered due to sustained low oil and other commodity prices. In the advanced economies, despite the uncertainties arising from the UK referendum, accommodative monetary policy stance of the region's central Banks, negative interest rate in Japan and elsewhere, as well as various fiscal stimuli, global inflation has remained suppressed. As deviations in macroeconomic 9 fundamentals in the advanced economies and the EMDEs widen, monetary policy could continue to diverge between the two in the short to medium term. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in August indicated that the economy had slipped into recession following another contraction in Q2, 2016. The August 2016 data showed domestic output in Q2, 2016 contracted by 206 per cent. This represented a decline of 170 percentage points in output from the -036 per cent recorded in Q1, and 441 percentage points lower than the 235 per cent 10 growth in the corresponding period of 2015. The non- oil sector contracted by 038 per cent, compared with the 018 per cent contraction in the preceding quarter. Agriculture Other Services; Education; Arts. Entertainment & Recreation; and Information & Communication, grew by 453, 432, 288, 180 and 135 per cent, respectively. The shocks associated with energy shortages and price hikes, scarcity of foreign exchange and depressed consumer demand, among others, apparently proved to be more damaging than expected. Recognizing that the conditions which precipitated the current economic downturn were not essentially sensitive to monetary policy interventions, 11 the MPC again renewed its call for urgent complementary fiscal policies to resuscitate production and engineer aggregate consumption. In particular, members underscored the imperatives of diversification of the economy away from oil into agriculture, manufacturing and services as well as more efforts towards payment of salaries and arrears of public sector employees particularly in states and local governments to stimulate aggregate consumption, as part of the overall fiscal policy menu kit. On the supply side, efforts must be intensified at increased capital expenditure to redress infrastructural deficits, improve the business environment and spur growth. 12 Prices The Committee noted that headline inflation (year-on- year) rose again in August to 176 per cent, from 171 per cent in July 2016, thus maintaining the upward trend since January 2016. The increase in headline inflation in August reflected increases in both food and core components of inflation. Core and food inflation have increased from 1693 and 1580 per cent in July to 172 and 1643 per cent, respectively, in August 2016. The Committee nonetheless, noted that the month-on- month evolution of consumer price inflation has been less phenomenal. The headline inflation index rose by 13 10 per cent in August from 13 per cent in July, 17 per cent in June; and 28 per cent in May 2016. Similarly the core index has been increasing at a decreasing rate since May when it rose by 27 per cent. It moderated to 085 per cent in August from 122 per cent in July and 183 per cent in June. The same pattern of moderation is seen in the food (month-on- month) index which rose by 12 per cent in August from 121 per cent in July, 14 per cent in June and 26 per cent in May. The MPC further noted that the pressure on consumer prices continues to be associated with reform-related legacy and structural factors including high costs of electricity, transport, production inputs, as well as 14 higher prices of both domestic and imported food products. The MPC expects that with the onset of the harvest season, the restrictive stance of policy as well as the flexible FX regime, prices will begin to taper in the fourth quarter. Monetary Credit and Financial Markets Developments Broad money supply (M2) grew by 808 per cent in August, 2016, compared with the July level of 1075 per cent. When annualized. M2 grew by 1212 per cent in August 2016 above the growth benchmark of 1098 per cent for 2016. Net domestic credit (NDC) grew by 2009 per cent in the same period, annualized at 3014 15 per cent. At this rate, the growth rate of NDC was above the provisional benchmark of 1794 per cent for 2016. The development in NDC, essentially reflected the relative growth in credit to the private sector of 2107 per cent in the month, annualized to 3161 per cent. Credit to government grew by 199 per cent in August 2016, which annualized to a growth of 30 per cent compared with the growth benchmark of 1328 per cent. The growth in M2 was traced to exchange rate effect following the depreciation of naira in the second quarter of the year. Money market interest rates reflected liquidity conditions in the economy. Average inter-bank call th rate, which stood at 1500 per cent on 8 July 2016, 16 closed at 3000 per cent on August 26, 2016. Between th th July 8 and 26 August 2016, interbank call rate averaged 2495 per cent. The rates increased to 500 per cent on July 15, 2016. The sharp increase was attributed to the drop in net liquidity during the period. The Committee noted a decline in the equities segment of the capital market as the All-Share Index (ASI) fell by 351 per cent from 28,,73390 on July 18, 2016, to 27,,72540 on September 15, 2016. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) declined by 355 per cent from N987 trillion to 952 trillion during the same period. In addition, relative to end-December 2015, the capital market indices fell by 2006 per cent and 335 per cent, respectively, reflecting the slowdown in the 17 economy. Overall the capital market did not show vulnerabilities to domestic and external sector developments. External Sector Developments The average naira exchange rate weakened at the inter-bank segment of the foreign exchange market during the review period. The exchange rate at the interbank market opened at N28525/US$ and closed at N30590/US$, with a daily average of N30287/US$ st between July 1 and August 26, 2016. The Committee observed that total foreign exchange inflows through the CBN increased by 8914 per cent, from US$1,,09221 million recorded in July to US$2,,06579 million in August 2016. This increase was due mainly 18 to receipts of foreign flows within the month. Total outflows, however, decreased by 457 per cent from US$2,,72812 million to US$2,,60335 during the same period. In direct efforts to deepen the foreign exchange market and stabilize the financial markets generally, a number of policy instruments were deployed since the last MPC meeting, including an increase in the benchmark interest rate. Complementary administrative measures were also taken towards achieving this goal, among which was the directive to IMTOs to sell forex directly to Bureau de Change Operators, in order to improve liquidity in that segment of the foreign exchange market. While challenges remained, the Committee expressed optimism that 19 with the crystallization of current policy measures, noticeable improvements should be observed in the financial markets. The Committee's Considerations The Committee acknowledged the weak macroeconomic performance and the challenges confronting the economy, but noted that the MPC had consistently called attention to the implications of the absence of robust fiscal policy to complement monetary policy in the past. The Committee also assessed the impact of its decision to tighten the stance of monetary policy by raising the MPR in July 2016. At the time, the Committee understood the complexity of the challenges facing the economy and 20 the difficulty of arriving at an optimal policy mix to address rising inflation and economic contraction, simultaneously. The Committee also recognized that monetary policy had been substantially burdened since 2009 and had been stretched. The Committee noted that new capital flows into the economy, approximately US$1 billion, had come in since July, while month-on-month inflation has declined continuously since May 2016. Against this background, members reemphasized the need to prioritize the use of monetary policy instruments in dealing essentially with stability issues around key prices (consumer prices and exchange rate) as prerequisites for growth. 21 The MPC noted that stagflation is indeed a very difficult economic condition with no quick fixes: having been imposed by supply shocks as well as fiscal and current account (twin) deficits. Consequently the policy framework must be reengineered urgently to provide a lever for reversing the negative growth trend. While the imperative for ensuring financial system stability remains, the MPC reiterated the fact that monetary policy alone cannot move the economy out of stagflation. The MPC considered the numerous analysis and calls for rates reduction but came to the conclusion that the greatest challenge to the economy today remains incomplete fiscal reforms which raise costs, risks and 22 uncertainty. The calls came mainly from the believe that reducing interest rates will spur credit growth, not only in the private sector but also by the public sector, which will help provide liquidity to stimulate consumption and investment spending. The Committee was of the view that in the past, the MPC had cut rates to achieve the above objectives; but found that rather than deploy the available liquidity to provide credit to agriculture and manufacturing sectors, the rate cuts provided opportunities for lending to traders who deployed the same liquidity in putting pressure on the foreign exchange market which had limited supply, thus pushing up the exchange rate. 23 With respect to providing opportunity to the public sector to borrow at lower rates to boost consumption and investment spending, the Committee agreed that while it was expected to stimulate growth through aggressive spending, doing so without corresponding efforts to boost industrial output by taking actions to deepen foreign exchange supply for raw materials will not help reduce unemployment nor would it boost industrial capacities. The Committee was also of the view that consumer demand for goods which will be boosted through increased spending may indeed be chasing too few goods which may further exacerbate the already heightened inflationary conditions. The urgency of a monetary-fiscal policy retreat along with 24 trade and budgetary policy, to design a comprehensive intervention mechanism is long overdue. The Bank has since 2009 expanded its balance sheet to bail out the financial system and support growth initiatives in the economy. While stimulating economic growth and creating a congenial investment climate always is and remains essentially the realm of fiscal policy; monetary policy in all cases only comes in to support sound fiscal policy. Nevertheless the Bank has and shall continue to deploy its development finance interventions to complement the overall effort of fiscal policy towards reinvigorating the economy. The interest rate decisions of the Bank are, therefore, 25 anchored on sound judgment, fundamentals and compelling arguments for such policy interventions. The Committee also feels that there was the need to continue to encourage the inflow of foreign capital into the economy by continuing to put in place incentives to gain the confidence of players in this segment of the foreign exchange market. Consequently the Committee considers that loosening monetary policy now is not advisable as real interest rates are negative, pressure exists on the foreign exchange market while inflation is trending upwards. The Committee noted the positive response of the deposit money banks (DMBs) to the Bank's call for increased credit to the private sector between July and 26 August. As the growth in the monetary aggregates spiked above their provisional benchmarks, headline inflation continued its upward trajectory in August 2016, and now close to twice the size of the upper limit of the policy reference band. Supply side factors including energy and utility prices, transportation and input costs, have continued to add to consumer price pressures. Members emphasized that improved fiscal activities, especially, the active implementation of the 2016 Federal Budget, and payment of salaries by states and local governments, will go a long way in contributing to economic recovery. In the same direction, the Committee urged the fiscal authorities to 27 consider tax incentives as a stimulus on both supply and demand sides of economic activities Outlook The data available to the Committee and forecasts of key variables suggest that the outlook for inflation in the medium term appears benign. First month-on- month inflation has since May 2016 turned the curve; second, harvests have started to kick-in for most agricultural produce and should contribute to dampening consumer prices in the months ahead; and third, the current stance of monetary policy is expected to continue to help lock-in expectations of inflation which, has started to improve with the gradual return of stability in the foreign exchange market. In this light, 28 the MPC believes that as inflows improve, the naira exchange rate should further stabilize. Overall the major pressure points remain the challenges in the oil sector (production and prices), output contraction, and other financial system vulnerabilities as well as foreign exchange shortage. The Committee's Decisions The Committee assessed the relevant risks, and concluded that the economy continues to face elevated risks on both price and output fronts. However given its primary mandate and considering the limitations of its instruments with respect to output, the Committee elected to retain the current stance of 29 policy. Conscious of the need to allow this and other measures like the foreign exchange market reforms to work through fully, the Committee decided to retain all the monetary policy instruments at their current levels. In summary, all 10 MPC members voted to: Retain the MPR at 1400 per cent; Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 3000 per cent; and Retain the Asymmetric Window at +200 and -500 basis points around the MPR Thank you for listening.

Philippines,2016-09-21,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 3.0 percent. The corresponding interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation environment remains manageable. Latest forecasts continue to indicate that average inflation is likely to settle slightly below the 3.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point target range in 2016 and rise toward the mid-point of the target range in 2017 and 2018. The Monetary Board observed that inflation is still being driven mainly by supply-side factors. Nevertheless, inflation expectations remain broadly in line with the inflation target over the policy horizon. The Monetary Board also recognized that while global economic conditions have remained subdued since the previous meeting, trends in domestic economic activity show sustained firmness, supported by solid private household consumption and investment, buoyant business and consumer sentiment, and adequate credit and domestic liquidity. Given the fiscal space, higher public spending is also expected to further boost domestic demand. At the same time, the overall balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook appears tilted to the upside, with pending petitions for adjustments in electricity rates along with the proposed adjustment in the excise tax rates of petroleum products and the potential second-round effect on transport fares. Slower global economic activity poses the main downside risk. With these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that current monetary policy settings remain appropriate. At the same time, increased uncertainty over prospects for growth and monetary policy action in major advanced economies warrants prudence in policy settings. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions to ensure price and financial stability conducive to sustained economic growth."
United States,2016-09-21,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year. Although the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been solid, on average. Household spending has been growing strongly but business fixed investment has remained soft. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Stanley Fischer; Jerome H Powell; and Daniel K Tarullo. Voting against the action were: Esther L George. Loretta J Mester, and Eric Rosengren, each of whom preferred at this meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. Implementation Note issued September 21, 2016."
Egypt,2016-09-22,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release September 22, 2016 In its meeting held on September 22, 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 1175 percent, 1275 percent, and 1225 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1225 percen. Headline year-on-year inflation rose to 1547 percent in August 2016 from 140 percent in July 2016 as the month-on-month rate increased to 193 percent in August from 074 percent in Jul. In the meantime, core inflation rose to 1325 percent in August 2016 from 1231 percent in July 2016 as the month-on-month rate increased to 061 percent in August from 025 percent in Jul. Monthly headline inflation in August 2016 came mainly due to higher prices of regulated items, primarily electricity, in addition to increases in prices of fresh vegetables and seasonal increases in prices of red meat associated with Eid-Al-Adh. The pass-through from previous exchange rate movements to domestic prices as measured by the consumer price index remained limite. Real GDP growth registered 43 percent during the first nine months of 2015/16, down from 48 percent during the respective period of the previous yea. Growth was driven by domestic demand, while net external demand contributed negativel. Domestic demand came largely due to consumption expenditure, while the contribution of investment expenditure was wea. By sector, real GDP growth was driven mainly by services, despite the contraction of touris. General government, trade and the agricultural sectors contributed positively as wel. These positive contributions were partly offset by the adverse impact stemming from the industrial sector, which was mainly driven by weaknesses in the mining sector, as the contribution of the manufacturing sector was negligibl. The current level of inflation and future upside risks are largely explained by transitory cost- push factors, while demand-side factors continue to pose downside risks to the inflation outloo. Given the balance of risks, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriat. The MPC reiterates its price stability mandate and will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, particularly fiscal policy and its effect on the inflation outlook, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Turkiye,2016-09-22,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 8.5 percent to 8.25 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 10 percent to 9.75 percent. Recently released data and indicators regarding the third quarter display a deceleration in the economic activity. The Committee assesses that current financial conditions are tight. While developments in tourism revenues will have a negative impact in the short run, the lagged effects of the developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans will continue to contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Demand from the European Union economies continues to support exports. With the supportive measures and incentives provided recently, domestic demand is expected to recover starting from the final quarter. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. The slowdown in aggregate demand contributes to the gradual fall in core inflation. With the help from falling food prices, headline inflation is expected to display a decline in the short term. Yet, the recent tax adjustment in fuel prices and other cost factors limit the improvement in inflation and thus necessitate the maintenance of a cautious monetary policy stance. In light of these assessments, and considering its contribution to the effectiveness of monetary policy, the Committee decided to take a measured and cautious step towards simplification. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2016-09-22,"South African Reserve Bank Press Statement Embargo Delivery 22 September 2016 Statement of the Monetary Policy Committee Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Headline consumer price inflation declined to within the target range of 3 to 6 per cent in August, in line with the Reserve Bank's expectations. Nevertheless, higher inflation outcomes are forecast in the near-term before a sustained return to within the target range during 2017. While domestic economic growth prospects appear more favourable following the positive surprise in the second quarter of this year, the outlook remains constrained against a backdrop of weak domestic fixed investment and low levels of business and consumer confidence. Risks from the global environment persist, although the volatility in global financial markets in the wake of the Brexit decision has subsided. Prospects for a resumption of US monetary policy tightening remain a key risk to the pattern of global capital flows and to emerging market exchange rates in general, with continued uncertainty regarding the timing and pace of future moves. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 6,0 per cent and 5,9 per cent in July and August respectively, 1. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 6,0 per cent and 5,9 per cent in July and August respectively, 1 down from 6,3 per cent in June. Food price inflation in August accelerated to a recent high of 11,6 per cent, with the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages contributing 1,7 percentage points to the overall inflation outcome. Goods price inflation measured 6,1 per cent in August, down from 6,5 per cent in July, while services price inflation was unchanged at 5,7 per cent. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity was also unchanged at 5,7 per cent. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased in June and July to 6,8 per cent and 7,4 per cent respectively, following a decline to 6,5 per cent in May. This acceleration was mainly due to the impact of the drought on manufactured food price inflation, which measured 12,6 per cent in July. This was its highest level since January 2009. Producer price inflation for agricultural products also remained elevated at around 20 per cent. The latest inflation forecast of the Bank has improved over the first four quarters of the forecast horizon, and remains more or less unchanged for the rest of the period. Inflation is expected to peak at 6,7 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year, compared with 7,1 per cent previously, with an earlier sustained return to within the target range now forecast to occur during the second quarter of 2017. Inflation is expected to average 6,4 per cent in 2016 and 5,8 per cent in 2017, compared with 6,6 per cent and 6,0 per cent previously. The forecast for 2018 is unchanged at an average of 5,5 per cent. The downward revisions are due in part to a lower starting point, lower administered price inflation assumptions (including petrol, electricity and rates and taxes inflation), as well as a less depreciated exchange rate assumption. 2 Compared with the previous forecast, core inflation is expected to average 0,1 percentage point less, at 5,7 per cent and 5,6 per cent in 2016 and 2017, and is unchanged at 5,3 per cent in 2018. Core inflation is expected to remain within the target range over the forecast period, with a peak of 5,9 per cent in the final quarter of this year. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research have remained relatively unchanged, but with some changes between the different groups of respondents. Average inflation expectations declined by 0,2 per cent to 6,0 per cent for 2017, and remained unchanged at 5,9 per cent for 2018. While expectations of both analysts and business people declined, those of trade union officials remained unchanged for 2017 but increased for 2018. The long- term 5-year-ahead inflation expectations are unchanged at 5,9 per cent and remain uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. Inflation expectations of analysts, as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey have also shown successive declines during the past few months, with the median expectation for inflation to return to within the target range during the second quarter of 2017. Longer-term expectations of market participants implicit in the break-even inflation rates (the yield differential between conventional bonds and inflation-linked bonds) declined further since the previous meeting of the MPC, although they remain above the upper end of the inflation target range. The global growth outlook remains subdued, amid slowing growth in the advanced economies and a general downward revision to forecasts. Although prospects for the US economy remain relatively favourable, outcomes have not been consistently positive, as evidenced by the recent weak consumer expenditure and manufacturing 3. Although prospects for the US economy remain relatively favourable, outcomes have not been consistently positive, as evidenced by the recent weak consumer expenditure and manufacturing 3 sector data. Nevertheless, labour market conditions have improved and the investment slowdown appears to have bottomed. Although the short term impacts of Brexit on the UK economy have not been as negative as initially feared, growth forecasts have been revised down as concerns remain regarding the longer term investment outlook. The euro area recovery remains steady but subdued. The Japanese economy remains caught in a deflation and low growth bind, following a weak second quarter. The recent firmer trend in commodity prices has improved growth prospects for commodity-producing emerging markets in particular, along with more favourable capital inflows. It is unclear how long these positive developments will continue. Indications are that the negative growth cycles in both Russia and Brazil have turned, and both countries are expected to record positive, but weak rates of growth in the near term. The Chinese economy appears to have stabilised following concerns about a slowdown earlier in the year, but concerns regarding the financial sector persist. Given the broadly benign global inflation environment, apart from in some emerging markets, monetary policies have generally remained accommodative, with further loosening or a loosening bias in a number of the advanced economies. A notable exception is the United States where the bias remains for a resumption of interest rate normalisation, but the timing remains uncertain. Following the decision of the Fed to keep rates unchanged yesterday, the market expectation is for the next move to be in December. The data-dependent nature of future decisions means that these prospects are likely to change with new data releases, imparting a degree of volatility 4. The data-dependent nature of future decisions means that these prospects are likely to change with new data releases, imparting a degree of volatility 4 to financial markets and to global capital flows. The US policy rate trajectory is still expected to be moderate. The rand exchange rate has been affected by these global events, but has also been impacted by domestic fundamentals and political developments. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand traded in a range of R14,73 and R13,28 against the US dollar and has appreciated by 6,3 per cent against the US dollar, by 4,3 per cent against the euro, and by 5,2 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The rand initially appreciated markedly in line with other emerging market currencies as the chances of US Fed tightening receded in August following disappointing labour market data. At that stage the rand recorded its strongest level since October 2015. This trend was reversed following increased domestic risk perceptions, which were also reflected in rising domestic government bond yields. More recently, the rand has been positively impacted by the stronger GDP growth outcome, and a significant narrowing of the current account deficit, following a sizeable trade account surplus in the second quarter. Although this may reflect in part a delayed adjustment to the depreciated rand exchange rate, the trade surplus is not expected to be sustained at similar levels in the coming months. The marked appreciation of the rand during the past few days appears to be driven by expectations of unchanged US monetary policy, as well as to speculation regarding possible purchases of rand related to a major M&A transaction. The rand, however, remains vulnerable to future changes in the US monetary policy stance, domestic political developments as well as to a risk of a possible ratings downgrade later in the year. Nevertheless, the upside risk to inflation from the exchange rate appears to have moderated somewhat. 5 The domestic economy remains weak despite the positive growth surprise in the second quarter of 2016, when an annualised growth rate of 3,3 per cent was recorded. This was driven by a rebound in the primary sector, and a surge in real exports. Mainly as a result of the higher starting point, the Bank's forecast for economic growth for 2016 has been revised upward from zero per cent to 0,4 per cent. The forecasts for the next two years have been increased marginally by 0,1 percentage points, to 1,2 per cent and 1,6 per cent respectively. Estimates of potential output growth are unchanged, implying a persistence of below-potential growth. The trend in the Bank's composite leading indicator of economic activity remains indicative of subdued growth. While the second quarter growth performance was more favourable, data for July suggest that this improvement is unlikely to be sustained in the third quarter. Both the mining and manufacturing sectors recorded negative month-to-month growth rates in July, and the Barclays PMI declined sharply in August following five consecutive months above the neutral 50-point mark. Stresses are also evident in the construction sector with a further sharp decline in building plans passed during July. A key constraint to the growth outlook remains the sluggish state of domestic gross fixed capital formation, which contributed negatively to GDP growth during the first two quarters of this year. In the second quarter of 2016, domestic fixed investment contracted in both the private and public sectors (including government and public corporations). Private sector fixed investment has recorded negative or zero growth for six consecutive quarters, reflecting low levels of business confidence. The RMB/BER business confidence index remains below the neutral level, despite an improvement in the third quarter. 6 This adverse investment climate and rising costs have contributed to the further deterioration in employment prospects in the mining and manufacturing sectors in particular. The official unemployment rate increased to 26,6 per cent in the second quarter, from 25,0 per cent a year earlier. The increase in employment that was recorded in the second quarter was almost entirely attributable to temporary employment opportunities related to the municipal elections. Consumption expenditure by households remains weak, despite a return to positive growth following the first quarter contraction. The annualised growth of 1,0 per cent suggests that consumers remain under pressure. Durable goods consumption continued to contract in the second quarter and is consistent with the further decline in the FNB/BER consumer confidence index. In July, retail trade sales declined further, in contrast to positive wholesale trade sales. Domestic new vehicle sales continued their negative trend in July and August, while exports of motor vehicles have remained robust. The outlook for consumption expenditure growth is expected to remain constrained, given the unfavourable employment outlook, the absence of significant positive wealth effects, and the slow pace of growth of real disposable income of households. Average wage growth and wage settlement rates have declined slightly, but there are risks of increases in excess of inflation and productivity gains. Credit extension to households continues to contract in real terms, likely driven by both the supply and demand side considerations. However, there has been a moderate increase in mortgage credit extension. As before, growth in credit extension to the corporate sector has been more resilient, but below its recent peaks. 7 Food prices remain a significant driver of inflation given the persistent drought, although long-range weather forecasts suggest improved rainfall prospects in the coming months. Food price inflation is still expected to reach a peak in the fourth quarter of this year, at around 12,3 per cent, slightly lower than in the previous forecast. Spot and futures prices of wheat and maize have declined in recent weeks, but meat prices are expected to rise further as farmers restock their herds. Global food price inflation has increased, mainly due to an acceleration in the price of sugar. International oil prices have fluctuated between US$40-US$50 per barrel for the past six months, amid uncertainty relating to a possible supply freeze by OPEC. The assumption for Brent crude oil in the Bank's forecasting model is unchanged, and assumes a moderate increase over the forecast period. After two consecutive months of price declines totalling R1,17 per litre, the domestic petrol price is expected to increase in October, due to adverse movements in the both the exchange rate and international product prices. The Monetary Policy Committee has noted improvements in the expected inflation trajectory during the course of the year. Apart from the tighter stance of monetary policy, this has also been driven by lower starting points, as inflation surprised at times on the downside, and changed assumptions underlying the forecast. The expected peak in headline inflation is notably lower, and an earlier return to within the target range is also expected. Most of the changes have been for the current and coming year, whereas the changes in the forecast for 2018 have been marginal. Changes to the core inflation forecast have been less pronounced, but it is no longer expected to breach the upper end of the target range. Despite these improvements, the longer-term inflation trajectory remains uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range, with high wage settlement rates and inflation expectations contributing to this persistence. 8 The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation forecast to be more or less balanced at this stage. The current level of the rand is stronger than that implicit in the forecast, and, in conjunction with continued low levels of pass-through from the rand to inflation, the risks are assessed to have moderated somewhat. However, some of the positive factors impacting on the rand may be temporary, and the rand remains vulnerable to both domestic and external shocks. The other major risk to the inflation outlook relates to food prices. The forecast still expects food prices to peak in the final quarter of this year. The future trajectory of these prices will be highly dependent on the normalisation of rainfall in the coming months. Favourable weather patterns could see food price inflation falling faster than that implicit in the forecast. Despite the improved growth performance in the second quarter, the growth outlook remains constrained as reflected in the more or less unchanged outlook for the next two years. The MPC assesses the risk to the growth forecast to be broadly balanced, and growth prospects remain dependent on global conditions, implementation of structural reforms, as well as changes in business and consumer confidence. Given improvements in the inflation forecast, the weak domestic economic outlook and the assessment of the balance of risks, the MPC has unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7,0 per cent per annum. The MPC remains concerned about the overall inflation trajectory which remains in the upper end of the inflation target range. 9 The MPC is of the view that should current forecasts transpire, we may be close to the end of the tightening cycle. The committee is aware that a number of the favourable factors that have contributed to the improved outlook can change very quickly resulting in a reassessment of this view. The bar for monetary accommodation, by contrast, remains high, as the MPC would need to see a more significant and sustained decline of the inflation trajectory to within the inflation target range.

Pakistan,2016-09-24,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement September 24, 2016 The year-on-year CPI inflation rose to. percent in August 2016 from. percent in August 2015, while the average inflation during the first two months of the current fiscal year was more than double the same period last year. Similarly the core inflation (measured as both non-food non-energy and 20 percent trimmed mean) during this period was also higher than the last year. The expected pick up in domestic demand is largely going to determine the inflation path in the remaining months of FY17. This is also reflected in the IBA-SBP Consumer Confidence Survey of September 2016 which shows improvements in current and expected economic conditions and major rise in consumer confidence. Uncertain global oil price continues to remain major determining risk. While year-on-year increase in monetary aggregates (M2) was 13. percent on 09 September, 2016 compared to 13. percent on 1 September 2015, it recorded seasonal contraction of. percent in 01 Jul- 09 September FY17 as against. percent contraction in the comparable period of FY16. Liquidity conditions in the money market remained broadly comfortable mainly due to retirement of government borrowing to the scheduled banks. Resultantly volatility in the interbank market was low as the overnight money market repo rate mostly remained close to the policy rate. Thus the ongoing stability in the market interest rates, with weighted average lending rates already at 12 year low in July 2016, is going to be instrumental during the start of the upcoming credit cycle for working capital and also for fixed investment. While the global growth outlook for 2016 is subdued, trend in international oil prices remains uncertain. Similarly anticipations of the impact of interest rate hike by the US-Fed, slowdown in the Chinese economy, and aftermath of Brexit on international financial and commodity markets is building up on this prevalent uncertainty. Pakistan has fared well so far owing to supporting macroeconomic environment and the record-high foreign exchange reserves have supported stability in the foreign exchange market. However the current account deficit is at the risk of widening further owing to declining exports and rising imports. As CPEC related projects are gathering momentum, the economy is projected to further expand at the back of improving industrial activity, especially construction and power generation, and rising demand for allied services. Relatively lower import prices of inputs, low interest rates, and better energy supplies are expected to boost manufacturing sector. Improved security situation would help in attracting foreign investment thus adding on to the sustainability of growth. Based on above macroeconomic considerations and after detailed deliberations, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to maintain the policy rate at.75 percent."
Israel,2016-09-26,"Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index for August declined by 0.3 percent, while the average of forecasters' predictions was for the CPI to remain unchanged. There was a seasonal decline of 4.9 percent in the clothing and footwear component, and a decline of 1.3 percent in the transport and communication component. The inflation rate as measuredby the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was -0.7 percent, compared with -0.6 percent in the 12 months ending in July. Excluding the direct effect of energy prices and administrative price reductions, the CPI increased by 0.6 percent over the past 12 months. Over the past 12 months, prices of tradable goods in the CPI declined by 3.4 percent, and the prices of nontradable items increased by 0.8 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: One-year inflationexpectations derived from the capital market declined to 0.4 percent following the publication of the August CPI reading, from 0.6 percent last month. Expectations for inflation over the coming 12 months derived from banks' internal interest rates declined from 0.3 percent to 0.2 percent,and private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings are for an increase of 0.7 percent, on average (compared to 0.6 percent in the previous month). Third-year forward expectations remained virtually unchanged (1.0 percent), and 3-5 year expectations remained virtually unchanged, at 1.3 percent. Longer-term expectations (5-10 years) remained without significant change, in the center of the target range, at 2.0 percent. According to the makam curve and projections by private forecasters, the Bank of Israel interest rate is not expected to change in the next year. The Telbor curve shows some probability of an increase in theinterest rate in a year. Real economic activity: Indicators that became available this month point to a higher pace of activity than that of previous years. According to the second estimate of National Accounts data for the second quarter. GDP grew by 4.0 percent (compared with 3.7 percent in the first estimate) (seasonally adjusted annual data), and exports (excluding diamonds and startups) grew by 10.9 percent (compared with 5.7 percent in the first estimate). Initial results from the Companies Survey for the third quarter are consistent with the assessment that the growth rate in that quarter willnot be lower than in previous years (2-3 percent). According to foreign trade data, goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft and diamonds, in current dollar terms) in July-August were 1.3 percent higher than the monthly average in the second quarter, and imports (excluding ships, aircraft, diamonds and fuels) remained unchanged. Following an increase in June, services exports (seasonally adjusted in current dollar terms) declined by 6.4 percent in July. Incoming tourism is having difficulty recovering, and the number of tourist arrivals was about 3 percent lower in January-August than in the correspondingperiod of last year. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.2 percent in August, led by increases in job vacancies, in retail trade revenue, and in building starts. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics declined slightly in August, but remains high. The index compiled by Bank Hapoalim increased again in August. There was a relatively sharp increase in the Purchasing Managers Index in August, to 57 points. The labor market: The picture conveyed by the labor market remains very positive. Wage increases continue, with an emphasis on business sector industries. Real wages increased by 0.3 percent (seasonally adjusted) in April-June compared with the preceding three months, whilenominal wages increased by 0.1 percent. Health tax receipts for June-August were 5.3 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period in the year before, reflecting the continued increase in employment and wages. Labor Force Survey data for August indicate that the unemployment rate among the prime working ages (25-64) (seasonally adjusted) remained at the low level of 4.0 percent, and the employment rate and the labor force participation rate continued to increase. The job vacancy rate increased to a record high of 4.0 percent (seasonally adjusted) in August. Budget data: The cumulative domestic deficit (excluding net credit) in government activity was NIS 2.8 billion in January-August 2016, compared with a deficit of approximately NIS 0.9 billion in the corresponding period of 2015, and it is about NIS 6.9 billion smaller than the deficit in the seasonal path consistent with achieving the deficit target for 2016. The deviation reflects revenues that were NIS 3.7 billion higher than the path, and expenditures that were NIS 3.2 billion lower than thepath. Tax revenues in August were about NIS 22.2 billion, which is about NIS 0.1 billion lower than the seasonal path consistent with the estimate oftax revenue (NIS 277 billion). Tax revenues in January-August wereabout 3.7 percent higher in real terms than in the corresponding period ofthe previous year. In August, gross domestic VAT collection declined by about 5.3 percent in real terms compared with August of 2015 (and it increased by about 0.3 percent net of the effect of legislative changes). Staff forecast: This month, the Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast. The notice of the forecast is being published in parallel with this release. Compared with the previous quarterly forecast, the current forecast reflects a similar assessment regarding the development of inflation and the interest rate, and more positive assessments regarding the growth rate. The inflation rate is expected to be 1.0 percent over the coming four quarters (compared with 1.1 percent in the previous forecast) and is expected to return to within the target range in the third quarter of 2017. The Bank of Israel interest rate is expected to remain at 0.1 percent during the coming year, and to increase to 0.25 percent toward the end of 2017. GDP is expected to grow by 2.8 percent in 2016 (compared with 2.4 percent in the previous forecast) in view of the upward revision of growth data, and to grow by 3.1 percent in 2017 (compared with 2.9 percent in the previous forecast). The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on August 28, 2016, through September 23, 2016, the shekel strengthened by 0.2 percent against the dollar, and by 0.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the preceding 12 months, the shekel appreciated by 4.9 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: Fromthe monetary policy discussion on August 28, 2016, through September 23, 2016, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 1 percent. Government bond yields declined by up to 7 basis points along the unindexed curve, and increased by up to 6 basis points in the medium to long terms along the CPI-indexed curve, with a steepening of the curve. The makam curve traded at ayield ranging around the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, declined slightly, to about 70 basis points. The money supply: In the 12 months ending in August, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 22.3 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 12.3 percent. The credit market: In the second quarter, business sectordebt increased by about NIS 13.9 billion (1.7 percent), to about NIS 829 billion. The increase was mainly a result of quantitative growth of about NIS 8 billion in tradable bonds in Israel, bank loans and nonbank loans. In August, the business sector (excluding banks, insurance companies and foreign companies) issued bonds totaling just NIS 2.5 billion, after issuances ofNIS 5.7 billion in July. The average monthly issuance in the past year wasabout NIS 3 billion. Funds specializing in corporate bonds in Israel and funds specializing in equities in Israel continued to attract net new investment in August and the beginning of September. Since March, funds specializing in corporate bonds in Israel recorded net new investment of about NIS 3.2 billion, and those specializing in equities in Israel had net new investment of about NIS 1.4 billion. Corporate bond spreads (excluding banks and insurance companies) declined over August in most industries, and were about 3 percentage points, on average, at the beginning of September: the lowest level in the past two years. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 9.2 billion (1.9 percent) in the second quarter, to about NIS 489 billion, of which there was an increase of about NIS 7 billion (2.2 percent) in housing debt, to about NIS 331 billion. In August, the total volume of new mortgages taken out was NIS 5.5 billion, slightly higher than the average of the past 12 months (NIS 5.1 billion). The share of mortgages taken out for the purchase of investment homes continues todecline, to 13.7 percent in August, compared with an average of 14.9 percent in the past 12 months. The average interest rate on mortgages continued to increase in August on all tracks: On the fixed-rate CPI-indexed track, rates increased by 0.04 percentage points, while on the variable-rate CPI-indexed track, rates increased by 0.15 percentage points. Rates on the fixed-rate unindexed track increased by 0.09 percentage points, and on the variable-rate unindexed track rates increased by 0.05 percentage points. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.4 percent in August, following an increase of 1.2 percent in July. Home prices increased by 0.1 percent in June-July, and figures for the preceding months were revised upward, including the decline recorded in the May-June figures (to -0.1 percent compared with -0.3 percent). Over the 12 months ending in June-July, home prices increased by 6 percent, lower than the increase of about 7 percent in the 12 months ending in May-June. Activity in the market remains robust, with about 9,000 transactions carried out in July, similar to the figure for June (9,200 transactions), and higher than the average over the past 12 months (about 8,000 transactions per month). New home sales declined moderately in July, to about 2,240 (seasonally adjusted), and the stockof homes available for sale declined slightly, but remained high at approximately 27,900 homes in July compared with 28,100 in June. The number of building starts increased in by 10.3 percent in the secondquarter compared with the first quarter (seasonally adjusted. Notably, thefirst estimate of building start figures is generally biased to the downside). There were about 48,700 building starts, and 41,100 building completions, in the past year. The global economy: The global economy continues to grow at a slow pace, and the growth rate of world trade continues to decline: growing by less than 1 percent in the past year. The OECD slightly lowered its global growth forecast, by 0.1 percentage point, for 2016 and for 2017. Central banks continue to conduct very accommodative monetary policy, and inflation remains very low, although some of the deflationary factors are beginning to moderate. In the US, the expectation according to the GDPNow index is that there will be growth of 2.9 percent in the third quarter, but this is a rate that will not be sufficient to compensate for the low growth of the first two quarters of the year. Personal consumption expenditure continues to drive the economy, while the weakness in the manufacturing sector continues. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 151,000 in August, a relatively low amount, but it was sufficient to prevent an increase in unemployment, and assessments are that the labor market is nearingfull employment. In its meeting this month, the Federal Reserve left the federal funds rate unchanged. According to market assessments, there is still a relatively high probability that the federal funds rate will be increased by 0.25 percentage points this year. Data that became available in Europe continue to indicate a low growth rate, and the ECB forecasts growth of just 1.6 percent in 2017-18. Political developments are the main risk to growth. This month, the ECB left its policy in place. In the UK, the Purchasing Managers Index that declined sharply followingthe referendum again increased to levels indicating expansion, but most assessments expect a negative impact to activity, the strength of which will depend on agreements that will be formulated. In Japan, growth remains near-zero, and the Bank of Japan announced a 'yield curve control' program in which it will strive to maintain the 10-year government bond yield at its current level of around 0 percent; in addition, it undertook to continue its monetary accommodation even after inflation reaches 2 percent. In most emerging economies, there was some improvement in assessments regarding economic activity, and in China most economic data published this month were positive. The Producer Price Index (PPI) in China has been just -0.8 percent since the beginning of the year, and its continued stability may reduce global deflationary pressure. The price of a barrel of Brent Sea crude oil ranged between $45-50 during the month. The index of commodities excluding energy declined at the beginning of the month, but then increased later on, finishing the month with a decline of 2 percent. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for October 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stabilitytarget range of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The Monetary Committee continues to assess that in view of the inflation environment, and of developments in the globaleconomy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time. Following are the main considerations underlying the decision: C 2B 7 After the months of Maythrough July, when the Consumer Price Index increased by a rate consistentwith the seasonal path of the inflation target, the CPI for August was markedly lower than the path. Inflation as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months continues to be negative, and short-term inflation expectations are still below the lower bound of the inflation target range. Medium-term and long-term expectations remain anchored within the target range. C 2B 7 The second estimate of National Accounts data for the second quarter was revised upward, and indicators that have become available to date point to the assessment that in the third quarter the economy continued to grow by a rate not less than that of recent years. The picture conveyed by labor market dataremains positive, with growth in employment and in wages; a shortage of workers is becoming apparent in various industries. C 2B 7 The global economy continues to grow by a slow rate, and the growth rate of world trade continues to decline. Central banks continue to conduct very accommodative monetary policy. Assessments are that there is a relatively high probability that the US federal funds rate will be increased by the end of the year, though the path of the expected interest rate increase for the coming years is lower than previously assessed. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on August 28, 2016, through September 23, 2016, the shekel strengthened by 0.2 percent against the dollar. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel appreciated by 0.3 percent, and has appreciated by 4.9 percent over the past 12 months. The level of the effective exchange rate continues to weigh on the growth of exports and of the tradable sector. C 2B 7 In thepast two months home prices have stabilized. In the second quarter there was an increase in the number of building starts. Monthly mortgage volume isstabilizing, with a continued increase in mortgage interest rates. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to achieving the inflation target remain high. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of thefinancial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for October 2016 will be published on October 10, 2016. The decision regarding the interest rate for November 2016 will be published at 16:00 on Thursday. October 27, 2016. C 2B 7 After the months of Maythrough July, when the Consumer Price Index increased by a rate consistentwith the seasonal path of the inflation target, the CPI for August was markedly lower than the path."
Armenia,2016-09-27,"Press Release 27.09.2016 At the September 27, 2016 meeting, the Board of the CBA decided to cut the Refinancing Rate by 0.5 pp, setting it at 6.75%. August posted price deflation of 0.5% compared to 0.1% of inflation recorded in the same month of the previous year. The 12-month inflation rate has reduced in the meantime, amounting to -1.9% at the end of the month. The CBA estimates that deflationary environment will remain low in September too, and then it is expected to soften notably by the end of the year. A slow pace of global economic growth and relative stability in international commodity markets persisted. However, minor inflationary trends were observable in respect of some commodities. The CBA Board estimates that inflationary effects from the external sector are not likely in the upcoming months. The CBA Board notes that the figures published in the third quarter of 2016 point to worsened growth outlook after high economic activity recorded in the first half of 2016. As a result, the CBA revised its expectations of developments in domestic demand. In this situation, the CBA estimates that external demand, which is still relatively strong, is no longer fully offsetting weak domestic demand, and this brings about risks to inflation indicator moving downward from the projected value. In the light of the inflation environment still persisting at low in the short run, significantly reduced inflationary expectations and increasing deflationary risks because of weak demand, the CBA Board finds it reasonable to continue easing the monetary conditions. This will help the deflation environment to largely phase out by the end of the year and the 12-month inflation rate to return to its target in the forecast horizon. The CBA Board admits that although the deflationary risks are prevalent in the short run, there are no significant risks to fulfilling the inflation target in the medium-term perspective. More information about interest rate setting will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) due on October 7, 2016. Press Service of the CBA."
Czech Republic,2016-09-29,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions. It confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna against the euro so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the CNB still stands ready to intervene automatically without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment is unchanged.. This decision is based on the message of the August forecast and on an assessment of newly available information obtained since the forecast was prepared. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the koruna exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until mid-2017. Inflation is starting to rise in line with the forecast, but it is still well below the CNB's target of 2%. Inflation is still being affected by anti-inflationary cost effects from abroad. Monetary policy looks past the first-round effects of such factors and focuses on any adverse second-round effects. According to the forecast, inflation will slightly exceed the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon and then return to it from above. According to the current forecast, sustainable fulfilment of the target, which is a condition for a return to conventional monetary policy, will occur in mid-2017. A need to maintain expansionary monetary conditions at least to the current extent persists. The Bank Board therefore states that the CNB will not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017 Q2. The Bank Board still considers it likely that the commitment will be discontinued in mid-2017. At the same time, the Bank Board stated again that any exchange rate appreciation following the discontinuation of the exchange rate commitment would be dampened, among other things, by hedging of exchange rate risk by exporters during the existence of the commitment, as well as by the closing of koruna positions by financial investors. In addition, the CNB will stand ready to intervene to mitigate exchange rate volatility. Headline inflation increased in line with the forecast in July and August, rebounding from levels close to zero. This was due mainly to food prices, which returned to year-on-year growth. Core inflation (adjusted inflation excluding fuels) remains markedly positive. It reflects the positive effect of growth in the domestic economy and wages. The growth of the Czech economy slowed in 2016 Q2, albeit less significantly than forecasted. The higher-than-expected growth was due to additions to inventories and net exports. By contrast, fixed investment declined more markedly than forecasted. The latest information on economic developments abroad largely confirms the assumptions of the current forecast. Economic growth in the effective euro area will temporarily slow below 2% next year. Producer prices in the Czech Republic's main trading partner countries are expected to return to growth in 2017. Consumer price inflation in the euro area will also start to increase. This will also be fostered by the ECB's continuing easy monetary policy, which is reflected in an outlook for slightly negative three-month Euribor rates over the entire forecast horizon. The market outlook still expects the Brent crude oil price to rise gradually. The current outlook for the euro-dollar exchange rate is also broadly in line with the assumptions of the current forecast. The rising domestic economic activity is manifesting itself in continued rapid growth in employment. This is reflected in a further drop in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate. Annual wage growth in the business sector remains close to 4%, although it moderated somewhat in Q2. Indicators from the real economy point to a continuing slowdown in economic growth in 2016 Q3. Industrial production saw a marked year-on-year fall in July, but this was largely due to one-off factors. The long-running decline in construction output, which mainly reflects a drop in public investment, deepened slightly further. By contrast, retail sales maintained solid growth. The year-on-year price decline in manufacturing has moderated in recent months, whereas agricultural producer prices are still falling sharply. Prices of market services are broadly stable year on year, whereas construction work prices continue to rise moderately. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy. GDP growth was slightly above the forecast in 2016 Q2, while average wage growth was somewhat lower than forecasted. Inflation and unemployment so far in Q3 were in line with the forecast."
Colombia,2016-09-30,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 7.75%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In August, annual consumer inflation and the average of core inflation indicators decreased, reaching 8.10% and 6.56%, respectively. Analysts' inflation expectations to one and two years also fell, posting at 4.35% and 3.61%, respectively, and those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years are between 3.4% and 3.6%. The normalization of the weather and agricultural supply generated reductions in food prices in August, and the annual rate of increase of this group is expected to decrease at least until the first quarter of 2017. The behavior of the prices that were most affected by the exchange rate suggests that pass-through of the devaluation of the peso to inflation is fading. The average growth of Colombia's trading partners in 2016 is likely to be lower than estimated a month ago. Regarding the United States, a slow tightening of its monetary policy is still projected. The price of oil remains above the levels recorded at the beginning of the year, and the prices of some international commodities imported by Colombia have fallen. With this, the terms of trade have increased, and are close to the average observed in 2015. The economic activity indicators for the third quarter, some of them heavily affected by the trucking strike, suggest that economic growth will be lower than the one recorded in the first half of the year. These figures suggest a downward bias in the forecast of the most likely growth rate for all 2016 (2.3%) by the technical staff of the Central Bank. In the first half of 2016, the current account deficit stood at USD 6,284 million, equivalent to 4.8% of GDP, lower by USD 3,233 million, and 1.5 percentage points versus the records a year ago. These results, together with the new foreign trade figures, indicate that the external deficit for all 2016 could be lower than forecast a month ago (US 15 billion, equivalent to 5.3% of GDP). In all, the Colombian economy continues to adjust to the strong shocks recorded since 2014, and the current account deficit is narrowing gradually. The effects of the transitory supply shocks that have affected inflation and inflation expectations have begun to reverse, and this trend is expected to continue. This, together with the monetary policy actions taken so far, should lead inflation to its target range in 2017. In this environment, after assessing the risk balance for inflation and growth, the Board of Directors deemed appropriate to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered. New data on the behavior of prices and aggregate demand will provide more information about the speed of the expected convergence of inflation to the target, and the intensity, nature, and persistence of the economic slowdown. The Board will continue to monitor the adjustment of expenditure and its consistency with the long-term income level, the sustainability of the external deficit, and, in general, macroeconomic stability. Also, it reaffirms its commitment to maintain inflation and its expectations anchored to the target, acknowledging that there has been a transitory increase in inflation. The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered was approved by the seven members of the Board."
Romania,2016-09-30," Video: Press briefing, 30 September 2016 (Romanian only)  Board meeting minutes. In its meeting of 30 September 2016, the Board of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) decided the following:. In line with expectations, the annual inflation rate added 0.6 percentage points against the previous month to -0.2 percent in August 2016. The annual inflation rate remaining in negative territory was attributed to the developments in administered prices, while volatile and tobacco prices posted positive dynamics year on year. Adjusted CORE2 inflation1 followed a slightly upward path, coming in at 0.5 percent in August. Turning to the 12-month averages, inflation rate advanced to -1.8 percent in August 2016 and that based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices rose to -1.4 percent. Economic growth exceeded expectations in 2016 Q2 (6 percent), as a result of the expansion in household consumption and investment, with an impact on the current account deficit. Net exports thus increased their negative contribution to annual GDP growth. On the supply side, the services sector had further a prevailing contribution to the pick-up in economic activity. In 2016 Q2 as a whole, the annual rate of increase of unit wage costs in industry remained as elevated as in the previous quarter, given that the step-up in wage growth was countered by the improvement in labour productivity dynamics. Real monetary conditions remained stimulative, underpinning the favourable developments in credit to the private sector, including in terms of the currency breakdown. The annual growth rate of leu-denominated loans stood at 14.5 percent in real terms in August, while the annual dynamics of foreign currency-denominated loans remained strongly negative at -12.9 percent. Against this background, the share of leu-denominated loans in total loans to the private sector climbed to 55.9 percent versus a 35.6 percent low in May 2012. These developments confirm the improved monetary policy transmission, while also helping mitigate the risks to financial stability. Recent assessments reconfirm the outlook for the annual inflation rate to remain in negative territory until end-2016. Thereafter, the annual inflation rate is expected to pick up gradually and return inside the variation band of the flat target in 2017 H2, amid the fading-out of the effects exerted by the standard VAT rate cuts and by global disinflationary shocks, along with inflationary pressures from aggregate demand and unit wage costs. Risks to the inflation outlook stem from elevated uncertainties surrounding both the domestic and external environments. Based on currently available data and in the context of heightened uncertainty, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum and to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system. Given the contraction in foreign currency lending, the consolidation of the adequate level of forex reserves (EUR 33.1 billion at end-August 2016) and their improved composition, the NBR Board has decided to cut the minimum reserve requirements ratio on foreign exchange-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 10 percent from 12 percent starting with the 24 October - 23 November 2016 maintenance period. The measure aims to continue the harmonisation of the minimum reserve requirements mechanism with the relevant standards and practices of the European Central Bank and the major central banks across the European Union. The minimum reserve requirements ratio on leu-denominated liabilities remains unchanged at 8 percent. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The consolidation of the economic picture calls for a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and progress in structural reforms. The NBR is closely monitoring external and domestic developments and stands ready to use all its available tools during this period of heightened uncertainty. According to the NBR Board decision, the account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 7 October 2016, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 4 November 2016, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1 Adjusted CORE2 inflation is calculated by excluding from the consumer price index the following categories: administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcoholic beverage prices."
Kazakhstan,2016-10-03,"PRESS - RELEASE #27 On the base rate October 3, 2016 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to reduce the base rate to 12.5% with a corridor of +/- 1 percentage points. The reduction in the base rate reflects positive trends in the key segments of the external market, as well as a stable situation in the domestic financial market. The National Bank of Kazakhstan will continue to reduce the base rate provided that the approaching pace of the annual inflation to the target band is confirmed, as well as the stability of the trend of changing currency preferences in favor of tenge instruments is preserved. The decision on the base rate was made with the account of the following factors. For 9 months of 2016 inflation amounted to 5.6%, in annual terms  16.6%. The sharp slowdown in the annual inflation rate is expected in October-November this year. In this regard, the National Bank expects that the annual inflation will approach to the upper boundary of the target band (6-8%) by the end of 2016 and will be within the target band in the course of 2017 in the absence of negative shocks. The results of the National Bank's survey show that inflation expectations of households have continued to decrease. According to the results, the share of respondents expecting high growth in prices has decreased. In September inflation risks and devaluation risks induced by July-August dynamics in world oil prices have noticeably lessened. Devaluation expectations of market participants are decreasing, that is evidenced in a steady decline in interest rates on non-deliverable forward contracts used to hedge currency risks. Decrease in prices is present both in the short-term and on the horizon of a year. In August 2016 the short-term economic indicator, which characterizes the developments in main sectors of economy, grew by 0.2% in annual terms. Macroeconomic indicators show a gradual adaptation of the economy to changes in external conditions and exchange rate volatility. Situation in the financial market remains stable. The National Bank's operations keep market interest rates within the interest rate corridor of the base rate. Formation of the term structure of the yield curve continues. Despite the positive trends, risks remain that require a balanced approach to the change in the base rate. A further decision on the base rate will depend on the trend in actual and forecasted inflation and currency preferences of the population and market. Provided that the slowdown in inflation processes and the trend towards a steady decline in the annual inflation are confirmed, as well as a stable growth of tenge deposits is observed the reduction in the base rate until the end of this year is not ruled out. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on November 14, 2016 at 17.00 Astana time."
India,2016-10-04,"Fourth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2016-17 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 6.5 per cent to 6.25 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.75 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with an accommodative stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving consumer price index (CPI) inflation at 5 per cent by Q4 of 2016-17 and the medium-term target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 2. Global growth has been slowing more than anticipated through 2016 so far, with weak investment and trade damping aggregate demand. Meanwhile, risks in the form of Brexit, banking stress in Europe, rebalancing of debt-fuelled growth in China, rising protectionism and diminishing confidence in monetary policy have slanted the outlook to the downside. World trade volume has contracted sharper than expected in the first half of 2016, and the outlook has worsened with the recent falling off of imports by advanced economies (AEs) from emerging market economies (EMEs). Inflation remains subdued in AEs and has started to edge down in EMEs. International financial markets were overwhelmed by the Brexit vote in Q2, with equity markets losing valuations worldwide, currencies plunging and turning volatile, and investors rushing for safe havens. Markets, however, recovered quickly and reclaimed lost ground in Q3, with a return of risk appetite propelling capital flows back into EMEs. Nonetheless, an uneasy calm prevails on uncertainty about the stance of monetary policy of systemic central banks. Commodity prices have firmed up slightly, easing stress for commodity exporters and shaving off some of the terms of trade gains accruing to commodity importers. Crude prices rose to a recent peak in Q2 of 2016, mostly on supply disruption in various parts of the world, and again in late September as the OPEC announced intentions of cutting back on supply; but, the upturn has been curbed by higher inventories. On the domestic front, the outlook for agricultural activity has brightened considerably. The south west monsoon ended the season with a cumulative deficit of only 3 per cent below the long period average, with 85 per cent of the country's geographical area having received normal to excess precipitation. Kharif sowing has surpassed last year's acreage, barring cotton, sugarcane and jute and mesta. Accordingly, the first advance2 estimates of kharif foodgrains production for 2016-17 by the Ministry of Agriculture have been placed at a record level, and higher than the target set for the year. The industrial sector, by contrast, suffered a manufacturing-driven contraction in early fiscal year Q2, after a sequential deceleration in gross value added in Q1. Even after trimming the statistical effects of the lumpy and order-driven contraction of insulated rubber cables, industrial production as measured by the index of industrial production (IIP) turned out to be slower than a year ago. In August, steel production rose to a 37-month high and cement production maintained momentum - auguring well for construction activity - even though the output of core industries as a whole was weighed down by a decline in the production of coal, crude oil and natural gas and deceleration in refinery products and electricity generation. Nonetheless, business expectations polled in the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey and by other agencies remain expansionary in Q2 and Q3. The strong public investment in roads, railways and inland waterways, the recent efforts to unclog cash flows in large projects under arbitration, and the boost to spending from the 7th Pay Commission's award, should improve the industrial outlook. In the services sector, the acceleration in the pace of activity in Q1 appears to have been sustained. An increasing number of high frequency indicators are moving into positive territory, construction is boosted by policy initiatives, and public administration, defence and other services will be supported by the pay commission award. Retail inflation measured by the headline CPI had been elevated by a sharp pick-up in the momentum of food inflation overwhelming favourable base effects during April-July. In August, however, the momentum of food inflation turned negative and surprised expectations; consequently, base effects in that month came into full play and pulled down headline inflation to an intra-year low. Fuel inflation has moderated steadily through the year so far. Inflation excluding food and fuel (including petrol and diesel embedded in transportation) has been sticky around 5 per cent, mainly in respect to education, medical and personal care services. Households reacted to the recent hardening of food inflation adaptively and raised their inflation expectations in the September 2016 round of the Reserve Bank's inflation expectations survey of households. Input costs in the manufacturing sector, including staff costs, have firmed up slightly as evident in various surveys, but the presence of considerable slack has restrained their transmission into corporate pricing power. Liquidity conditions have remained comfortable in Q3, with the Reserve Bank absorbing liquidity on a net basis through variable rate reverse repo auctions of varying tenors. Liquidity was injected through open market purchases of 200 billion in line with the system's requirements. As a result, the weighted average call money rate (WACR) remained tightly aligned with the policy repo rate and, in fact, traded with a soft bias. Interest rates on commercial paper (CPs) and certificates of deposit (CD) also eased. In the external sector, merchandise exports contracted in the first two months of Q2. Subdued domestic demand was, however, reflected in a faster contraction in imports. Moreover, the still soft crude prices pared off a fifth of the oil import bill and gold import volume slumped to a fifth of its volume a year ago. Consequently, the merchandise trade deficit narrowed by US$ 10 billion in April-August on a year-on-year basis. These developments are likely to have contained the current account deficit in Q2 at its level in Q1, although the decline in remittances and the flattening of software earnings warrants monitoring. While the pace of foreign direct investment slowed compared to a year ago, portfolio flows were stronger after the Brexit vote, galvanised by a search for returns in an expanding universe of negative yields. The level of foreign exchange reserves rose to US$ 372 billion by September 30, 2016  an all-time high.3 Outlook 8. The Committee expects that the strong improvement in sowing, along with supply management measures, will improve the food inflation outlook. It notes that the sharp drop in inflation reflects a downward shift in the momentum of food inflation  which holds the key to future inflation outcomes  rather than merely the statistical effects of a favourable base effect. The Government has announced several measures to cool food inflation pressures, especially with regard to pulses. These measures should help in moderating the momentum of food inflation in the months ahead. This has opened up space for policy action, as indicated in the third bi-monthly monetary policy statement. The easy liquidity conditions engendered by the Reserve Bank's operations should also enable the smooth transmission of the policy action through various market segments. Furthermore, banks should find added impetus for better transmission by the recent downward adjustment in small savings rates. The Committee took note of potential cost push pressures that may emerge, including the 7th pay commission award on house rent allowances, and the increase in minimum wages with possible spillovers through minimum support prices. The fuller play of these factors will need vigilance to prevent a generalised cost spiral from taking root. On balance, the Committee envisages a trajectory taking headline CPI inflation towards a central tendency of 5 per cent by March 2017, with risks tilted to the upside albeit lower than in the second and third bi- monthly monetary policy statements of June and August respectively (Chart 1). The momentum of growth is expected to quicken with a normal monsoon raising agricultural growth and rural demand, as well as by the stimulus to the urban consumption spending from the pay commission's award. The accommodative stance of monetary policy and comfortable liquidity conditions should support a revival of credit to the productive sectors. The continuing sluggishness in world trade and smaller terms of trade gains than in the past point, however, to further slackening of external demand going forward. Accordingly, the projection of growth of real gross value added (GVA) for 2016-17 is retained at 7.6 per cent, with risks evenly balanced around it (Chart 2). Six members voted in favour of the monetary policy decision. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published on October 18, 2016. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on December 6 and 7, 2016 and its resolution will be announced on December 7, 2016. Alpana Killawala Press Release : 2016-2017/847 Principal Adviser."
Poland,2016-10-05,"Warsaw, 5 October 2016 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 4-5 October 2016 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 1.50%;  lombard rate at 2.50%;  deposit rate at 0.50%;  rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic growth remains moderate, while uncertainty about its outlook continues. In the euro area, economic growth is stable despite the negative impact of the weak economic conditions in the non-European emerging market economies. In the United States, incoming data point to some acceleration in GDP growth in 2016 Q3, which is accompanied by further improvement in the labour market. In China, economic growth is lower than in previous years, but recent data indicates a stabilisation of economic conditions. Meanwhile, in Russia recession is gradually receding. Global commodity prices  despite a rise since the beginning of the year  are lower than in previous years. Low level of commodity prices, along with moderate global economic activity, has been the main factor behind low consumer price growth in many economies. The European Central Bank keeps its interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and continues financial asset purchases. The Federal Reserve  after a hike in December 2015  keeps the interest rates unchanged, indicating their possible increase in the future. In Poland, stable economic growth continues. Incoming data indicate that GDP growth in 2015 Q3 was probably close to that observed in the previous quarter. Steadily increasing consumer demand remains the main driver of economic growth. Consumer demand is supported by gradual improvement in the labour market, favourable household sentiment and the child benefit payments under the ”Family 500 plus” programme. Data on construction and assembly output indicate that declining investment is still containing economic activity. The decrease in investment is related to temporarily lower absorption of EU funds after expiration of the previous EU financial framework, as well as uncertainty in the enterprise sector. Annual growth in prices of consumer goods and services remains negative, yet deflation is gradually subsiding. Weakening deflationary trends are also visible in producer price developments. The increase in price growth results from dissipating effects of the earlier sharp fall in global commodity prices, and also the gradual acceleration in wage growth in Poland. Price growth is contained by low inflation abroad 1/2 and negative output gap in the domestic economy. At the same time, inflation expectations remain low. In the Council's opinion, the scale of deflation will continue to decrease in the coming months. Higher price growth will be supported by stable GDP growth, amid accelerating wage growth and higher child benefits. In the coming quarters, investment growth should also rise, supported by good financial standing of enterprises, growing capacity utilisation of firms and a gradual increase in absorption of EU funds. The sources of uncertainty for expected economic activity and price developments are risks of a deterioration in global economy and a fall in commodity prices. The Council confirms its assessment that  given the available data and forecasts  the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance."
South Korea,2016-10-13,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that the Chinese economy has maintained its moderate pace of growth. However, the improvements in the euro area have remained weak. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its recovery going forward, albeit at a moderate pace, while being affected by factors including changes in the monetary policies of major countries such as the US, the uncertainties related to Britain's exit from the European Union, and economic conditions in emerging market countries. Looking at the Korean economy, exports have declined but domestic demand activities appear to have continued their improvements, driven mainly by investment in construction. On the employment front, the trend of increase in the number of persons employed slowed in September, while the unemployment rate rose compared to that in September of last year. The employment-to-population ratio was meanwhile slightly higher. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of modest growth going forward, owing chiefly to a gradual recovery in global trade and to the effects of expansionary macroeconomic policies. However, in view of economic conditions domestically and abroad, it judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to be high. Consumer price inflation rose from 0.4% the month before to 1.2% in September, owing chiefly to increases in agricultural product prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also rose to 1.3%, from 1.1% in August. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales and leasehold deposit prices have continued, centering around the Seoul area. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will gradually rise, due mainly to the disappearance of the effect of the temporary cut in electricity fees and to the rebound in international oil prices. In the domestic financial markets since September, long-term market interest rates and the Korean won-US dollar and Korean won-Japanese yen exchange rates have risen, in line mainly with strengthened expectations of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. Stock prices have rebounded after having declined, owing in part to the rise in international oil prices. Household lending has sustained a trend of substantial increase at a level exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the trend of increase in household debt, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and the progress of corporate restructuring."
Peru,2016-10-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2016 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is consistent with an inflation forecast in which inflation is gradually converging to 2.0 percent in the monetary policy horizon and takes into account that: Inflation expectations continue declining gradually; The effects of the rise in the prices of some food products and utilities as well as the effects of the exchange rate on inflation have been lower than in previous months; Local economic activity has been grwoing at a rate close to its potential growth level, and The global economy continues showing mixed signals of recovery in terms of production and employment, as well as lower volatility in financial markets. The Board oversees new data on inflation and inflation determinants in the forecast horizon to evaluate the convenience of making additional adjustments in the monetary policy rate. Inflation is expected to remain within the upper band of the inflation target range in the next months and to continue showing a downward trend in 2017, the rate of inflation at end-2017 being estimated at 2.0 percent. Inflation in September showed a rate of 0.21 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate of inflation went from 2.94 percent in August to 3.13 percent in September. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.11 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate rose from 2.96 percent to 3.01 percent. Inflation expectations have continued to decrease and continue to show a declining path that is within the target range in the following years. Indicators of business expectations have improved for the fourth consecutive month and remain on the optimistic side. In line with this. GDP is expected to grow 3.8 percent in 2016 and 4.2 percent in 2017. However, the indicators associated with construcion and manufacturing have declined in the past three months due to the weakness of investment. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for Novermber on November 10, 2016."
Chile,2016-10-18,"Santiago. Chile. Thursday, 18 October 2016 Monetary Policy Meeting  October 2016 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3.5%. Internationally, monetary and financial conditions are still favorable and long-term interest rates remain low. On the activity side, incoming data brought no big news, pointing to a gradual recovery of world growth next year. Despite fluctuations, the prices of commodities rose during the month, especially oil. On the domestic front. September's CPI was unexpectedly low, making annual inflation approach 3% sooner than expected. Various expectations indicators place inflation around the target in the projection horizon. Partial third-quarter data continue to point at limited growth in output and demand, consistent with the Monetary Policy Report's baseline scenario. The labor market continues to adjust gradually. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. The Spanish original prevails."
Brazil,2016-10-19,"The Copom released the following note to the public&#58. The Copom released the following note to the public:. ""202nd Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (=9CCopom=9D) of the Central Bank of Brazil Press Release*. The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate to 14.00 percent per year, without bias. The Copoms baseline scenario can be summarized by the following observations:. The set of indicators released since the last Copom meeting suggests that economic activity ran slightly below expectations in the short run, probably due to fluctuations that usually occur at the current stage of the business cycle. Available evidence is consistent with recent stabilization of economic activity and with the possibility of a gradual pick-up in economic activity. The economy continues to operate with a high level of economic slack. The external outlook still offers a relatively benign environment for emerging economies. However, uncertainties regarding global economic growth and, especially, the pace of monetary policy normalization in the United States, remain. Recent inflation releases were more favorable than expected, partly due to a reversal of increases in food prices. Inflation expectations for 2017 collected by the Focus survey fell to around 5.0% since the previous Copom meeting and the last Inflation Report, and remain above the 4.5% inflation target. Expectations for 2018 and longer horizons are already around that level; and. The Committees inflation forecasts for 2016 in the reference and market scenarios fell since the last Inflation Report, to around 7.0%. Over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, the behavior of inflation forecasts have differed according to the scenario. Under the assumptions of the reference scenario, the forecast for 2017 inflation fell to approximately 4.3%, whereas the forecast for 2018 sits around 3.9%. In the market scenario, the forecast for 2017 inflation remained essentially unchanged at 4.9%, and the forecast for 2018 increased slightly, to 4.7% - both figures are above the 4.5% inflation target for these two calendar years. The Committee identifies the following domestic risks to the baseline scenario for inflation:. On the one hand, the process of approval and implementation of the necessary adjustments in the economy is lengthy, and carries uncertainty; the prolonged period with high inflation and above-target expectations can still strengthen inertial mechanisms and delay the disinflation process; and there are signs that the process of disinflation of IPCA components that are most sensitive to monetary policy and economic slack took a pause recently, which may point to slower convergence of inflation to target. On the other hand, short-run inflation behavior has been more favorable, which may signal lower inflation persistence; the level of economic slack may lead to disinflation at a faster pace than the one reflected in Copoms projections; and the first steps toward the necessary adjustments in the economy have been positive, which may signal faster-than-anticipated approval and implementation. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the current balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom decided to reduce the Selic rate to 14.00 percent per year, without bias. The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the 2017 and 2018 target is compatible with a moderate and gradual easing of monetary conditions. The Committee will assess the pace and magnitude of monetary easing over time, in order to assure convergence of inflation to the 4.5% target. The magnitude of monetary easing and a possible speeding up of its pace will depend on a favorable evolution of factors that allow greater confidence on meeting the inflation targets at the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2017 and 2018. The Committee emphasizes the following domestic factors: that disinflation of IPCA components that are most sensitive to monetary policy and economic slack resumes clearly and at an appropriate pace; and that the pace of approval and implementation of the necessary economic adjustments contribute to inflation dynamics that are compatible with inflation converging to target. The Committee will assess the evolution of the combination of such factors. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Anthero de Moraes Meirelles. Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira. Luiz Edson Feltrim. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Reinaldo Le Grazie. Sidnei Corr=AAa Marques and Tiago Couto Berriel.""."

Euroarea,2016-10-20,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that the monthly asset purchases of €80 billion are intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The information that has become available since our meeting in early September confirms a continued moderate but steady recovery of the euro area economy and a gradual rise in inflation, in line with our previous expectations. The euro area economy has continued to show resilience to the adverse effects of global economic and political uncertainty, aided by our comprehensive monetary policy measures, which ensure very favourable financing conditions for firms and households. Overall, however, the baseline scenario remains subject to downside risks. Looking ahead, we remain committed to preserving the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation which is necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. To that end, we will continue to act, if warranted, by using all the instruments available within our mandate. In December the Governing Council's assessment will benefit from the new staff macroeconomic projections extending through to 2019 and from the work of the Eurosystem committees on the options to ensure the smooth implementation of our purchase programme until March 2017, or beyond, if necessary. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP in the euro area increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2016, after 0.5% in the first quarter. The latest data and survey results point to continued growth in the third quarter of 2016, at around the same pace as in the second quarter. Looking further ahead, we expect the economic expansion to proceed at a moderate but steady pace. Domestic demand should be supported by the pass-through of our monetary policy measures to the real economy. Favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability continue to promote a recovery in investment. Moreover, still relatively low oil prices and sustained employment gains, which are also benefiting from past structural reforms, provide additional support for households' real disposable income and private consumption. In addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area will be broadly neutral in 2017. However, the economic recovery in the euro area is expected to be dampened by still subdued foreign demand, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. The risks to the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside and relate mainly to the external environment. According to Eurostat, euro area annual HICP inflation in September 2016 was 0.4%, up from 0.2% in August. This reflected mainly a continued increase in annual energy inflation, while there are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation. Looking ahead, on the basis of current oil futures prices, inflation rates are likely to pick up over the next couple of months, in large part owing to base effects in the annual rate of change of energy prices. Supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should increase further in 2017 and 2018. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continued to increase at a robust pace in August 2016, with its annual rate of growth standing at 5.1%, after 4.9% in July. As in previous months, annual growth in M3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 expanding at an annual rate of 8.9% in August, after 8.4% in July. Loan dynamics followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 1.9% in August 2016. The annual growth rate of loans to households also remained stable, at 1.8%, in August. Although developments in bank credit continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, the monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 are significantly supporting borrowing conditions for firms and households and thereby credit flows across the euro area. The euro area bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2016 indicates some further improvements in both supply and demand conditions for loans to the non-financial private sector. Furthermore, banks continued to report that the ECB's asset purchase programme and the negative deposit facility rate had contributed to more favourable terms and conditions on loans. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need to preserve the very substantial amount of monetary support that is necessary in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. As emphasised repeatedly by the Governing Council, and as again strongly echoed in both European and international policy discussions, in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the European level. The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up to reduce structural unemployment and boost potential output growth in the euro area. The focus should be on actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, which are vital to increase investment and boost job creation. The enhancement of current investment initiatives, including the extension of the Juncker plan, progress on the capital markets union and reforms that will improve the resolution of non-performing loans will also contribute positively to this objective. In an environment of accommodative monetary policy, the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also make the euro area more resilient to global shocks. Fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. Full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact over time and across countries remains crucial to ensure confidence in the fiscal framework. At the same time, all countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies."
Turkiye,2016-10-20,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 8.25 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 7.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been kept at 9.75 percent. Recently released data and indicators regarding the third quarter display a deceleration in the economic activity. Reduced tightness in monetary conditions and the recent macroprudential measures support the overall financial conditions. The lagged effects of the terms of trade developments and the moderate course of consumer loans limit the widening in the current account balance driven by the decline in tourism revenues. Demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports. With the supportive measures and incentives provided recently, domestic demand is expected to recover starting from the final quarter. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. The slowdown in aggregate demand contributes to the gradual fall in core inflation. Yet, the recent developments in exchange rates and other cost factors restrain the improvement in inflation outlook and thus necessitate the maintenance of a cautious monetary policy stance. In light of these assessments, the Committee decided to keep the interest rates at current levels. The Committee stated that the direction and the timing of the next step in the monetary policy simplification process will be data dependent. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Hungary,2016-10-25,"At its meeting on 25 October 2016, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 26 October 2016:. In the Council's assessment. Hungarian economic growth continues to pick up from the middle of the year following the temporary slowdown at the beginning of 2016. There continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflation remains persistently below the Bank's target. Looking ahead, the disinflationary impact of the domestic real economic environment is gradually decreasing. As the Monetary Council expected, inflation rose again into positive territory in September 2016. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation continue to indicate a moderate inflationary environment in the economy. Persistently low global inflation is restraining the pace of increase in domestic consumer prices. Inflation expectations are at historically low levels. Whole-economy wage growth remains strong, which is likely to raise core inflation gradually through rising household consumption. Inflation remains below the 3 per cent target over the forecast period, and only gets close to it by the middle of 2018. Hungarian economic growth accelerated in the second quarter of 2016, and, based on monthly indicators, it picked up further in the third quarter, in line with the Bank's expectations. The robust expansion in retail sales continued in August. Further growth is expected in household consumption in the coming quarters. Industrial production increased strongly in August. This growth following the decline in previous months is primarily due to the rise in vehicle industry output. Labour demand remained strong, and therefore the number of employees increased again, while the unemployment rate fell further. Both corporate and household lending increased in August. New household loans exceeded repayments for the first time since the crisis. The time profile of this year's economic growth is characterised by duality. Following temporary slow growth at the beginning of the year, the pick-up in domestic demand, the extension of the Funding for Growth Scheme, the Growth Supporting Programme, the easing measures of monetary policy as well as the Government's measures will help achieve economic growth of around 3 per cent. Sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile since the Council's latest interest rate-setting decision, mainly driven by news related to the oil market and the stability of some European banks as well as by expectations about monetary policy actions by the world's leading central banks. The forint appreciated against the euro, and short-term money market rates and government securities yields fell overall. Hungary's strong external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. Forward-looking domestic money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are declining even further as inflation rises. However, in the Council's assessment, a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. At its meeting in September, the Monetary Council set a HUF 900 billion upper limit on the 2016 year-end stock of three-month central bank deposits, which according to the Council's expectation means the crowding out of at least HUF 200400 billion liquidity from the deposit facility. The Council considers the limit on the three-month deposit stock and its potential future change an integral part of monetary policy instruments. At its meeting today, the Monetary Council decided to lower the required reserve ratio for banks from 2 per cent to 1 per cent, effective from 1 December 2016. As a result, freely available liquidity of the banking system will expand further by HUF 170 billion. The Bank aims to ease monetary conditions and provide a corresponding degree of support to the economy through a decline in money market rates. The Monetary Council is making every effort to ensure that the limit imposed on the stock of three-month deposits exerts its expected easing effect efficiently. The Monetary Council decided to leave the base rate unchanged. In order to increase the banking system's liquidity and ease monetary conditions further, the Council reduced the overnight lending rate by 10 basis points to 1.05 per cent while leaving the overnight deposit rate unchanged at -0.05 per cent. As a result, the interest rate corridor narrowed further. In accordance with this, the interest rate on the one-week central bank loan fell by 5 basis points to 1.00 per cent. In the Council's assessment, there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflation remains moderate for an extended period. The disinflationary impact of the real economy is gradually decreasing over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, maintaining the current level of the base rate for an extended period and the loosening of monetary conditions by the change in the monetary policy instruments are consistent with the medium-term achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank closely monitors developments in monetary conditions and markets. If subsequently warranted by the achievement of the inflation target, the Council will stand ready to ease monetary conditions further."
Georgia,2016-10-26,"26.10.2016 The National Bank of Georgia keeps its monetary policy rate unchanged at 6.5%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on 26th of October 2016 and made a decision to keep refinancing rate unchanged at 6.5%. According to the macroeconomic forecast, the reduced inflation rate and weak aggregate demand point out the need for decrease policy rate down to neutral level in the medium term. As the previous decrease in policy rate has not been fully transmitted to the economy. NBG decided to reduce policy rate only gradually. Other things equal the refinancing rate is expected to reduce to 6% in the coming two qurters. Based on the macroeconomic forecast, the inflation rate will return to its natural level in the second half of 2017. In September, the annual inflation level on consumer prices has decreased by 0.1%. The decline in inflation can be attributed to the weak aggregate demand, lower inflationary expectations and reduced prices on consumer goods in international markets. Moreover, from the beginning of the year, a sharp decrease in the annual inflation rate was a result of base effect. The effect of external shock on Georgia's economy has weakened. In September, the decreasing trend in exports sector has reversed, promoting the improvement in the trade balance. The positive trend is also observed in the services sector, notably in tourism. In line with increased number of visitors, the revenues from tourism are also growing. The increased trust in monetary policy instruments has led to the growth in demand for Gel loans, improving the monetary policy transmission mechanism, which in turn promotes aggregate demand and the economic recovery in general. Improved monetary policy transmission mechanism, on the other hand, creates further easing effect of monetary policy. Thus, at this stage NBG has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on 14th of December 2016."
Israel,2016-10-27,"Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor September declined by 0.1 percent, similar to the forecasters'predictions. There was a decline of 1.9 percent in the fruit and vegetables component. The inflation rate as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was -0.4 percent, while the change was -0.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August, and there has been a marked upward trend in the annual inflation rate since April. Excluding the direct effect of energy prices and administrative price reductions, the CPI increased by 0.2 percent over the past 12 months. Over the past 12 months, prices of tradable goods in the CPI declined by 2.2 percent, and the prices of nontradable items increased by 0.5 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: There was no significant change in inflation expectations. One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market were 0.5 percent, compared with 0.4 percent just prior to the previous interest rate decision. Expectations for inflation over the coming 12 months derived from banks' internal interest rates remained at 0.2 percent, and private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings are for an increase of 0.7 percent, on average (similar to the previous month). Third-year forward expectations remained stable at 1.0 percent, and 3-5 year expectationsdeclined slightly, from 1.3 percent to 1.2 percent. Longer-term expectations (5-10 years) remained unchanged, in the center of the target range, at about 2.0 percent. Similar to the previous month, according to the <i>makam curve, the Bank of Israel interest rate is not expected to change in the next year, but professional forecasters' estimations and the Telbor curve indicate some probability of an increase in the interest rate in about a year. Real economic activity: The small amountof data on real economic activity published this month (due to the holidayperiod) point to a continuation of the positive picture of economic activity. In the third estimate of National Accounts data for the second quarter,the GDP growth rate was revised upward again, mainly as a result of the upward revision of export data. In the past three years, goods exports have grown more slowly than world trade, while services exports have grown more rapidly. According to the Companies Survey, it may be assessed that in the third quarter as well, continued growth in activity is expected, and in various industries companies report hiring constraints. The Purchasing ManagersIndex declined in September after increasing sharply in August, but it remains above 50 points, the level that distinguishes between expansion and contraction of activity. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by Bank Hapoalim also declined in September, but its level remains high. The index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics was unchanged in September. The labor market: The picture conveyed by the labor market remains very positive. The number of employee posts increased by 0.5 percent in July, and has increased by 2.8 percent in the past 12 months. Real wages increased by 0.1 percent (seasonally adjusted) in May-July compared with the preceding three months, and nominal wages increased by a similar rate. Health tax receipts for July-September were 6.3 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding periodin the year before, reflecting the continued increase in employment and wages. Budget data: The cumulative domestic deficit (excluding net credit) in government activity was NIS 2.9 billion in January-September 2016, compared with a deficit of approximately NIS 1.3 billion in the corresponding period of 2015, and it is about NIS 7.7 billion smaller than the deficit in the seasonal path consistent with achieving the deficit target for 2016. The deviation reflects revenues that were NIS 5.7 billion higher than the path, and expenditures that were about NIS 2 billion lower than the path. Tax revenues in September were about NIS 25.3 billion, which is about NIS 1.5 billion higher than the seasonal path consistent with the estimate of tax revenue in the original budget. (In September, the Ministry of Finance raised the forecast of tax revenue.) In September, gross domestic VAT collection increased by about 3.5 percent in real terms compared with September of 2015 (and it increased by about 10 percent net of the effect of legislative changes). A significant portion of the increase in tax revenue in September may be attributed to the timing of the holidays this year. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on September 25, 2016, through October 26, 2016, the shekel weakened by 2.2 percent against the dollar, and by 0.5 percent interms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the preceding 12 months, the shekel appreciated by 3.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on September 25, 2016, through October 26, 2016, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 2.3 percent.Government bond yields increased by up to 14 basis points along the unindexed curve, with a steepening of the curve, and increased by up to 23 basis points along the CPI-indexed curve, with a flattening of the curve. The makam curve traded at a yield ranging around the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, declined slightly, to about 67 basis points. The money supply: In the 12 months ending in September, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 16.9 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 9.2 percent. The credit market: In September, the business sector (excluding banks, insurance companies and foreign companies) issued a record NIS 10.9 billion in bonds, after issuances of just NIS 2.5 billion in August. The prominent issuing industries were trade and services (NIS 6.2 billion), and real estate and construction (NIS 4.1 billion). The average monthly issuance in the past year increased as a result of September's total, to about NIS 3.6 billion. Funds specializing in corporate bonds in Israel and funds specializing in equities in Israel continued toattract net new investment in September and the beginning of October. Since March, funds specializing in corporate bonds in Israel recorded net new investment of about NIS 3.3 billion, and those specializing in equities in Israel had net new investment of about NIS 1.7 billion. Corporate bond spreads (excluding banks and insurance companies) declined slightly in September, to 2.9 percentage points on average. In September, the total volume of new mortgages taken out was NIS 4.9 billion, and in the past year, monthly mortgage volume has stabilized at an average of about NIS 5.2 billion. The average interest rate on mortgages continued to increase in September on all tracks. On the fixed-rate CPI-indexed track, rates increased by 0.25 percentage points, and on the variable-rate CPI-indexed track, rates increased by 0.23 percentage points. Rates on the fixed-rate unindexed track increased by 0.17 percentage points, and on the variable-rate unindexed track rates increased by 0.15 percentage points. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.1 percent in September, following an increase of 0.4 percent in August. Home prices increasedby 0.4 percent in July-August, and figures for the preceding months were again revised upward. Over the 12 months ending in August, home prices increased by 6.8 percent, compared with 6.6 percent in the 12 months ending in July. Activity in the market remains robust, with about 8,400 transactions carried out in August, compared with the average over the past 12 months of about 8,150 transactions per month. New home sales increased slightly in August, to about 2,320 (seasonally adjusted), and the stock of new homes available for sale resumed its increase, reaching a record of about 28,900 homes in August. The global economy: The global economy continues to grow by a slow rate, and according to the IMF forecast published this month, the expected rate of growth remains 3.1 percent for 2016 and 3.4 percent for 2017, similar to the growth rate in 2015. The expected growth rate of world trade continues to decline, with the forecast rate for 2016 revised from 2.7 percent to 2.3 percent, and the forecast for 2017 revised from 3.9 percent to 3.8 percent. Central banks continue to conduct very accommodative monetary policy, and inflation in most advanced economies remains relatively low, although it is in a gradual upward trend, against the background of energy and commodity price increases. In the US, core inflation is ranging around 2 percent, and the expected growth rate in the third quarter according to the GDPNow index was revised downward, to 2.0 percent: a growth rate that will not be sufficient to compensate for the low growth of the previous two quarters. Personal consumption expenditure continues to drive the economy, while nonresidential investment continued to contract in the first half of the year. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 156,000 in September, and even though there was a slight increase of 0.1 percentage points in the unemployment rate (5.0 percent): against the background of an increase in the participation rate: assessments are that thelabor market is nearing full employment. According to market assessments, there is a relatively high probability that the federal funds rate will be increased by 0.25 percentage points this year, but the pace of increases thereafter is expected to be slow. Data that became available in Europe continue to indicate a moderate growth rate, and the IMF revised the expected growth rate for 2016 slightly downward, to 1.7 percent. The political uncertainty in the eurozone remains high. Inflation in the eurozone remains low, but the annual inflation rate increased by 0.2 percentage points in September, to 0.4 percent, and inflation in the four leading economies is no longernegative. In the UK, the government said it will invoke Article 50, which will begin the process of withdrawal from the EU, toward the end of the first quarter of 2017, and due to the announcement, there was marked depreciation of the pound sterling. Real data still do not indicate a significant effect of the Brexit decision, though based on most assessments a marked slowdown in activity in 2017 is expected. Deflationary pressures in Japan continued to increase, despite the accommodative policy measures adopted by the central bank. Third quarter data published to date continue to reflect a relatively low level of activity, in line with the low growth potential. In most emerging economies, there was some improvement in assessments regardingeconomic activity. Economic data published this month in China indicated stability in the pace of activity, and reduced concerns of a 'hard landing'. Third quarter growth was 6.7 percent, year-on-year. The Producer Price Index (PPI) in China increased in September from -0.8 percent to 0.1 percent, after 5 years in which it was negative. Its continued stabilization will contribute to a reduction in global deflationary pressures. The price of a barrel of Brent Sea crude oil increased $50 during the month. The index of commodities excluding energy declined slightly. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for November 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target range of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The Monetary Committee continues to assess that in view of the inflation environment, and of developments in the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time. Following are the main considerations underlying the decision: C 2B 7 The CPI for September declined by 0.1 percent, a rate in accordance with expectations and that is in line with the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target. Inflation as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months remains negative, but the effects of the decline inenergy components and of initiated price reductions are contracting. Short-term inflation expectations remained stable this month, below the lower bound of the inflation target range. Medium-term and long-term expectations remain anchored within the target range. C 2B 7 The picture of real economic activity remains positive, with second quarter growth driven by growth in all uses. Companies Survey data point to the assessment that growth in activity is expected to have continued in the third quarter as well. The picture conveyed by labor market data remains positive, with growth in employment and in wages; the Companies Survey indicates that in various industries, companies are reporting hiring constraints. C 2B 7 The global economy continues to grow at a slow pace. The IMF kept its global growth forecast unchanged, though the forecast for world trade growth was revised downward and is likely to be affected by political developments in some advanced economies. Central banks continue to conduct very accommodative monetary policy. The probability of a 0.25 percentage point increase in the US federal funds rate by the end of the year is relatively high, though the pace of the expected interest rate increases afterward is expected to be slow. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on September 25, 2016, through October 26, 2016, the shekel weakened by 2.2 percent against the dollar, and depreciated by 0.5 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The shekel has appreciated by 3.4 percent over the past 12 months in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The level of the effective exchange rate continues to weigh on the growth of exports and of the tradable sector. C 2B 7 Home prices continue to rise, and previous months' indices were revised upward. Alongside this, the increase in the stock of unsold new homescontinues. Monthly mortgage volume is stabilizing, with a continued increase in mortgage interest rates. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to achieving the inflation target remain high. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need to use various tools to achieve its objectives of pricestability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for thestability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housingmarket. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for November 2016 will be published on November 10, 2016. The decision regarding the interest rate for December 2016 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. November 28, 2016. Print Page. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor September declined by 0.1 percent, similar to the forecasters'predictions. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for November 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target range of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability.

Ukraine,2016-10-27,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the key policy rate to 14%, effective from 28 October 2016. Further alleviation of risks to price stability has given the National Bank of Ukraine some room to further ease monetary policy, which was consistent with the need to achieve its inflation targets in 2017-2018. In September 2016, annual inflation stood at 7.9% and was fully in line with the NBU's forecast. The acceleration of headline inflation was mainly attributed to upward adjustments in administered prices. At the same time, inflationary pressures, driven by fundamental factors, continued to ease, further contributing to the slowdown in core inflation to 6.3% y-o-y. The deceleration in core inflation was underpinned by moderate consumer demand, high supply of food products due to abundant crops, and prudent monetary policy. In October. FX supply exceeded demand in the FX market, enabling the NBU to purchase foreign currency to replenish international reserves without counteracting the appreciation trend. The NBU has kept its headline inflation targets for 2016-2018 unchanged. In Q4 2016, inflation is expected to return to the target level as a result of the reflection of upward adjustments in statistics for utility tariffs. At the same time, in the absence of significant unforeseen events, the NBU is on course to meet the year-end inflation target for 2016 (12% +/-3%). Annual inflation is expected to follow an erratic path throughout 2017. In Q1-Q3 2017, inflation might exceed 12%, reflecting a statistical base effect and a high contribution from administered prices. As these effects wane, annual inflation is expected to return to the NBU target level in Q4 2017. At the same time, core inflation is expected to remain stable at 5-6%. Therefore, the inflation targets for 2017 and 2018 (8% +/-2% and 6% +/-2 %, respectively) remain within reach and will be supported by the appropriate monetary policy. In 2016, the economic growth forecast remained unchanged at 1.1%. In the medium-term. GDP is expected to grow at a more moderate pace than earlier expected: 2.5% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2018. The weaker GDP growth forecast reflects the revision of assumptions related to a worsened external environment for Ukrainian exporters. A pick-up in investment activity is expected to be the key driver of economic growth. Lower risks of the escalation of military conflict stimulate economic agents' appetite to make investment and long-term consumer decisions. However, this will lead to an increase in investment imports, including machinery and equipment. As a result, net exports are expected to make a negative contribution to GDP. However, going forward, a recovery in investment demand will help boost export potential. At the same time, on the forecast horizon, higher investment activity is a key factor behind the upward revision in the current account deficit forecast at USD 2.5 billion in 2016. USD 2.9 billion in 2017 and USD 2.8 billion in 2018. In 2017-2018, the overall balance of payments is expected show a surplus supported by financial account net inflows, including FDI inflows. These inflows, combined with expected disbursements of future IMF loan tranches, will increase international reserves up to USD 17.5 billion by the end of 2016. USD 23.1 billion by the end of 2017, and USD 27.8 billion by the end of 2018. Further progress in advancing economic reforms under the IMF-supported program is critical for bringing inflation down to the target level and supporting economic recovery. Should the baseline forecast scenario materialize and, accordingly, risks to price stability abate further, the NBU will continue to move ahead with monetary easing. This would help bring down borrowing costs and underpin economic growth. The decision to cut the key policy rate to 14% is approved by NBU Board Decision No. 372-RSh, dated 27 October 2016. On The Key Policy Rate. A detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 3 November 2016. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held as scheduled on 8 December 2016."
Colombia,2016-10-28,"Pgina relacionada. Minutes of the Meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica on Friday. October 28, 2016. The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 7.75%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In September, annual consumer inflation and the average of core inflation indicators decreased, reaching 7.27% and 6.29%, respectively. Analysts' inflation expectations to one and two years posted at 4.23% and 3.65%, respectively, and those embedded in 2, 3, and 5 years public debt bonds are around 3.6%. The effects of the strong transitory supply shocks that diverted inflation from the target are beginning to fade at a pace slightly higher than expected. This is suggested by the slowdown in the CPI for food and the recent behavior of prices more impacted by the strong nominal depreciation in the past. Global economic activity has been somewhat weaker than estimated, and it is likely that it will register a slight recovery in 2017. A gradual tightening of the US monetary policy is still projected. The price of oil remains above the levels recorded at the beginning of the year, and the prices of some international commodities imported by Colombia have fallen. With this, the terms of trade increased in the third quarter, but remain low, close to the average observed in 2015. The economic activity indicators for the third quarter, some of them heavily affected by the trucking strike, suggest that economic growth will be lower than the one recorded in the first half of the year. The technical staff reduced the most likely growth figure for 2016 from 2.3% to 2.0%, with a new range projected between 1.5% and 2.5%. The new figures for foreign trade indicate that the external deficit continues to adjust. For 2016, the technical staff reduced the projection of the current account deficit to 4.7 percent as a proportion of GDP (equivalent to US 13.2 billion). In this environment, after assessing the risk balance for inflation and growth, the Board of Directors deemed appropriate to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered. New data on the behavior of prices and aggregate demand will provide more information about the speed of the expected convergence of inflation to the target, and the intensity, nature, and persistence of the economic slowdown. The Board will continue to monitor the adjustment of expenditures and its consistency with the long-term income level, the sustainability of the external deficit, and, in general, the macroeconomic stability. Also, it reaffirms its commitment to maintain inflation and its expectations anchored to the target, acknowledging that there has been a transitory increase in inflation. The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered was reached unanimously."
United States,2016-11-02,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year. Although the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been solid. Household spending has been rising moderately but business fixed investment has remained soft. Inflation has increased somewhat since earlier this year but is still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up but remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Stanley Fischer; Jerome H Powell; Eric Rosengren; and Daniel K Tarullo. Voting against the action were: Esther L George and Loretta J Mester, each of whom preferred at this meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. Implementation Note issued November 2, 2016."
Czech Republic,2016-11-03,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions. It confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna against the euro so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the CNB still stands ready to intervene automatically without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment is unchanged.. This decision is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. The forecast assumes that the exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until mid-2017. Inflation is starting to rise, but it is still well below the CNB's target of 2%. According to the forecast, inflation will increase further and slightly exceed the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon. During 2018, it will return to the target from above. According to the new forecast, sustainable fulfilment of the target, which is a condition for a return to conventional monetary policy, will occur from mid-2017 onwards. A need to maintain expansionary monetary conditions at least to the current extent persists. The Bank Board therefore states again that the CNB will not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017 Q2. The Bank Board still considers it likely that the commitment will be discontinued in mid-2017. According to the assumptions of the new forecast, economic growth in the effective euro area will slow next year. It will reflect, among other things, the impacts of the result of the UK referendum on economic sentiment. Growth in the Czech Republic's major trading partner countries will return to 2% in 2018. The decline in industrial producer prices in the euro area, which mainly reflects low energy commodity prices, has already started to fade. These producer prices will return to year-on-year growth at the start of next year. Consumer price inflation abroad will also go up gradually. However, it will stay below 2% until the end of 2018. The outlook for three-month EURIBOR market interest rates is negative over the entire forecast horizon. It thus reflects the continued easy monetary policy of the European Central Bank. This is contributing to expectations of a further slight depreciation of the euro against the US dollar. The outlook for the Brent crude oil price is gradually rising. Domestic inflation increased slightly in 2016 Q3 but stayed well below the CNB's target. However, the anti-inflationary cost factors from abroad are already starting to fade and their effect will disappear next year. Core inflation, i.e. adjusted inflation excluding fuels, remains distinctly positive. It reflects the positive effect of growth in the domestic economy and wages. Inflation will continue to rise on account of the above factors and will slightly exceed the 2% inflation target at the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in late 2017/early 2018. Monetary policy-relevant inflation, i.e. inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, will deviate only marginally from headline inflation. It, too, will therefore slightly exceed the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon. The growth of the Czech economy eased slightly in Q2. It will reach 2.8% in 2016 as a whole. This slowdown was due to a temporary drop in government and corporate investment co-financed from EU funds. By contrast, the economy continues to be supported by still easy monetary conditions, low commodity prices and rising external demand. In the next two years, economic growth will maintain a similar pace as this year. On the one hand, growth in investment will resume, but on the other hand domestic economic growth will be dampened somewhat by a temporary slowdown in external demand and later also less easy monetary conditions following the discontinuation of the CNB's exchange rate commitment. The continued economic growth will lead to higher wage growth. The unemployment rate will decrease only slightly. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until mid-2017. Consistent with the forecast is an increase in market interest rates thereafter. The return to conventional monetary policy will not result in the exchange rate appreciating sharply to the slightly overvalued level recorded before the CNB started intervening, among other things because the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to the price level and other nominal variables. At the same time, the Bank Board stated again that any exchange rate appreciation following the discontinuation of the exchange rate commitment would be dampened, among other things, by hedging of exchange rate risk by exporters during the existence of the commitment, as well as by the closing of koruna positions by financial investors. In addition, the CNB will stand ready to intervene to mitigate exchange rate volatility. Compared to the previous forecast, the outlooks for headline and monetary policy-relevant inflation are slightly lower. The forecast for Czech economic growth this year has been revised slightly upwards. By contrast, the economic growth forecast for the next two years has been lowered marginally owing to a worse outlook for external demand and weaker growth in private investment. The rise in interest rates after the exit from the CNB's exchange rate commitment, which the forecast continues to assume will occur in mid-2017, is slower than in the previous forecast."
Romania,2016-11-04," Video: Press conference, 10 November 2016 - quarterly inflation report (Romanian only)  Video: Press briefing, 4 November 2016 (Romanian only)  Board meeting minutes. In its meeting of 4 November 2016, the Board of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) decided the following:. The NBR Board has also analysed and approved the new quarterly Inflation Report which will be released to the public on November 10, 2016. The annual inflation rate declined in September 2016 to -0.6 percent, slightly below the forecasted level, after having reached -0.2 percent in August. This was due to the decrease in volatile food prices. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate1 remained at 0.5 percent. Excluding the transitory effects of the standard VAT rate cut, the annual inflation rate would have stood at 0.8 percent in September 2016. The average inflation rate advanced to -1.7 percent in September 2016 (from -2.0 percent in June 2016) and that based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices rose to -1.3 percent (from -1.7 percent in June 2016). Economic growth gained momentum in 2016 Q2 to 6 percent, prompted by household final consumption, to which added gross fixed capital formation. However, net exports increased their negative contribution to annual GDP growth. The latest statistical data point to the deceleration in retail trade dynamics in the first months of Q3, as well as to a step-up in the growth rate of industrial output, mainly ascribable to the manufacturing sector. At the same time, the current account deficit widened more slowly as a result of larger EU fund inflows. Real monetary conditions remained stimulative. Credit to the private sector saw its dynamics pick up slightly to 1.2 percent in September, partly on account of loans to non-financial corporations. The share of the leu-denominated component in total loans to the private sector continued to widen, albeit at a slower pace, reaching 56.2 percent. These developments support the improvement in monetary policy transmission, while also helping mitigate the risks to financial stability. In today's meeting, the Board of the National Bank of Romania examined and approved the November 2016 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The baseline scenario of the projection reconfirms the outlook for the annual inflation rate to remain in negative territory until end-2016. Moreover, the projection also reconfirms that the inflation rate will embark on an upward path at the beginning of 2017. The annual inflation rate is expected to return inside the variation band of the target at mid-2017 and stand in the upper half of the band at the end of the projection horizon. This trajectory reflects both the fading out of the transitory effects of the standard VAT rate cuts and the waning influences of global disinflationary shocks, as well as the inflationary pressures exerted by the gradual opening of a positive output gap and by unit wage costs. The risks and uncertainties associated with the inflation outlook stem from both domestic and external sources. On the domestic front, risks relate primarily to the configuration of the 2017 budget. Risks from the external environment are mainly generated by the lingering uncertainties about global economic growth and euro area economic recovery, given the slow-in-coming rebound of major emerging economies, the challenges facing the European banking system, and the outcome of the UK referendum. Based on currently available data and in the context of these elevated uncertainties, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum, to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system, and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The consolidation of the economic picture calls for a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and progress in structural reforms. The NBR is closely monitoring external and domestic developments and stands ready to use all its available tools during this period of heightened uncertainty. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference on 10 November 2016. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 11 November 2016, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 6 January 2017. 1 Calculated by excluding from the consumer price index the following categories: administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcoholic beverage prices."
Philippines,2016-11-09,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 3.0 percent. The corresponding interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that inflation continues to be manageable, with a gradual return to the inflation target range expected over the policy horizon. While latest forecasts indicate that average inflation is likely to settle slightly below the lower edge of the 3.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point target range in 2016, it is projected to rise toward the mid-point of the target range in 2017 and 2018. The overall balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook remains tilted to the upside owing largely to the pending petitions for adjustments in electricity rates along with the proposed tax policy reform program. Slower global economic activity continues to be a key downside risk. Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain broadly consistent with the inflation target over the policy horizon. At the same time, the Monetary Board also observed that prospects for global economic growth remain modest and uneven since the previous meeting. Moreover, monetary policies in major advanced economies continue to be asynchronous and the prospects uncertain. On the other hand, domestic economic activity is seen to remain firm, supported by solid private household consumption and investment, buoyant business and consumer sentiment, and adequate credit and domestic liquidity. Higher fiscal spending is also expected to further boost domestic demand in the near term. On balance, the assessment of recent new information continues to support keeping monetary policy settings unchanged. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions to ensure price and financial stability conducive to sustained economic growth."
Poland,2016-11-09,"Warsaw, 9 November 2016 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 8-9 November 2016 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 1.50%;  lombard rate at 2.50%;  deposit rate at 0.50%;  rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic growth remains moderate with uncertainty about its outlook. In the euro area, despite negative impact of weak economic conditions in the non-European emerging markets on exports, economic growth is stable, as indicated by national accounts data for 2016 Q3. In the United States. GDP growth picked up in 2016 Q3 following several quarters of deceleration. In China, economic growth has stabilised at a lower level than in previous years. In Russia, recession is gradually receding. Amid moderate global economic growth and lower commodity prices than in previous years, price growth in the environment of the Polish economy is still very low. However, annual price growth in commodity prices has been positive, leading to slightly higher inflation in some economies. The European Central Bank has kept interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and has continued financial asset purchases. The Federal Reserve  after a hike in December 2015  has kept the interest rates unchanged, pointing to their probable increase in the future. In Poland, stable economic growth has continued, although current data indicate that in 2016 Q3 it may have fallen slightly. The main driver of growth is rising consumer demand, which is supported by the gradual improvement in the labour market, favourable household sentiment and the child benefit payments under the ”Family 500 plus” programme. Data on construction and assembly output indicate that declining investment is still containing economic activity. The decrease in investment is related to temporarily lower absorption of EU funds after expiration of the previous EU financial framework, as well as continued uncertainty about the regulatory environment of business. Annual growth in prices of consumer goods and services has remained negative, yet deflation is gradually subsiding. Descending deflationary trends are also reflected by a growth in producer prices. The increase in price growth results from the dissipating effects of the earlier sharp fall in global commodity prices, and also the higher wage growth in Poland compared to previous quarters. Price growth is contained by low 1/2 inflation abroad and negative output gap in the domestic economy. At the same time, inflation expectations remain low. The Council became acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute. In line with the November projection based on the NECMOD model  prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 21 October 2016  there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of -0.7 ÷ -0.6% in 2016 (against -0.9 ÷ -0.3% in the July 2016 projection), 0.5 ÷ 2.0% in 2017 (compared to 0.3 ÷ 2.2%) and 0.3 ÷ 2.6% in 2018 (compared to 0.3 ÷ 2.6%). The annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 2.5 ÷ 3.4% in 2016 (against 2.6 ÷ 3.8% in the July 2016 projection), 2.6 ÷ 4.5% in 2017 (compared to 2.4 ÷ 4.5%) and 2.2 ÷ 4.4% in 2018 (compared to 2.1 ÷ 4.3%). In the Council's opinion, price growth will continue to gradually increase and in the coming quarters it will turn positive. Besides waned effects of the earlier falls in commodity prices, price growth in 2017 will be driven by an expected acceleration in GDP growth amid a further rise in wage growth and higher child benefits. In the coming quarters, the investment growth rate should also rise, supported by the good financial standing of enterprises and their high capacity utilisation, as well as the gradual increase in the absorption of EU funds. Such an assessment is supported by NBP November projection. The source of uncertainty for expected price developments is the risk of a fall in commodity prices. The Council confirms its assessment that  given the available data and forecasts  the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance. The Council adopted Inflation Report  November 2016 and Opinion on the 2017 Draft Budget Act."
Thailand,2016-11-09,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 9 November 2016 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 9 November 2016 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to expand at a pace close to the previous assessment despite greater downside risks on both domestic and external fronts. Inflation was expected to increase but might return to the target later than expected due to supply-side factors. Meanwhile monetary conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery. Hence the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. The Thai economy was projected to recover at a pace close to the previous assessment. Exports of industrial goods expanded more than expected, while private investment remained low despite some improvements seen in certain export-oriented manufacturing sectors. At the same time, tourism was expected to slow down as a result of the government's measures to curb zero-dollar tours. Private consumption continued to expand although some activities might slow down temporarily. Public expenditure continued to be an important growth driver. Overall under the Committee's assessment, the Thai economy remained on a recovery path, but downside risks increased from the number of Chinese tourists that could turn out to be lower than the previous projection as well as uncertainties stemming from political developments in the US and Europe. Meanwhile concerns over the European and Chinese financial sectors continued to warrant close monitoring. Headline inflation in October softened slightly on account of fresh food prices, while core inflation remained stable around the previous assessment. The Committee expected that headline inflation would rise slowly and might return to the target later than previously projected, depending on fresh food prices as well as global oil price developments which remained largely uncertain. Nevertheless headline inflation was still expected to gradually pick up, while the public's medium-term inflation expectations remained close to the inflation target. Overall monetary conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery as reflected in low real interest rates and government bond yields. Nonetheless the baht appreciated against key trading partner currencies which might not be beneficial to the ongoing economic recovery. In addition, financial stability remained sound and able to provide cushion against potential shocks and volatilities in financial markets. However there remained pockets of risks that warranted close monitoring, such as the deterioration in loan quality of some business sectors and the search-for-yield behavior under the prolonged low interest rate environment. The Committee saw the need to preserve policy space given that the Thai economy would still be facing greater uncertainties going forward, particularly the fragile global economic recovery and uncertainties in the economic and monetary policy directions of major advanced economies that might induce greater capital flow and exchange rate volatility. 2 Going forward, the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative, and stands ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to ensure that monetary conditions are conducive to the economic recovery, while ensuring financial stability."
South Korea,2016-11-11,"Base Rate unchanged at 1., 25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that the Chinese economy has maintained its moderate pace of growth. The euro area has also shown improvements, although they have been weak. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its moderate recovery going forward, while being affected by factors such as changes in US monetary policy, the directions of the new US government\x80\x99s economic policies, the uncertainties related to Britain's exit from the European Union, and economic conditions in emerging market countries. Looking at the Korean economy, exports have continued their trend of decline while the improvements in domestic demand activities appear to have weakened a bit. On the employment front, the employment-to-population ratio in October was slightly higher than that in October of last year, as the number of persons employed increased. The unemployment rate meanwhile rose somewhat. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of modest growth going forward, in line with a recovery of the global economy, but in view of recent changes in domestic and external conditions judges the uncertainties surrounding the growth path to have increased further. Consumer price inflation rose from 1., 2% the month before to 1., 3% in October, owing chiefly to the expiration of a temporary cut in electricity fees. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also rose to 1., 5%, from 1., 3% in September. In the housing market, the extents of increase in sales and leasehold deposit prices have expanded, centering around the Seoul area. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will gradually rise, due mainly to the weakening influence of the low oil prices. In the domestic financial markets since October, influenced mainly by strengthened expectations of a policy rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, and by the result of the US presidential election, long-term market interest rates and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate have risen to large extents and stock prices have declined. The Korean won-Japanese yen exchange rate has fallen slightly. Household lending has sustained a trend of substantial increase at a level exceeding that of recent years, led by mortgage loans. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the uncertainties in domestic and external conditions and their effects, any changes in the monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve, and the trend of increase in household debt. The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its moderate recovery going forward, while being affected by factors such as changes in US monetary policy, the directions of the new US government's economic policies, the uncertainties related to Britain's exit from the European Union, and economic conditions in emerging market countries. Consumer price inflation rose from 1.2% the month before to 1.3% in October, owing chiefly to the expiration of a temporary cut in electricity fees. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also rose to 1.5%, from 1.3% in September."
Kazakhstan,2016-11-14,"PRESS - RELEASE #34 On the base rate November 14, 2016 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to reduce the base rate to 12% with a corridor of +/- 1 percentage points. The decision reflects the downward trend of inflation in line with the forecast, continuing pace of de-dollarization of bank deposits, and reduced inflation expectations of households. Increased uncertainties in the global markets, which may be followed by the slowdown in the process of reallocation of foreign currency assets into the national currency, as well as the sensibility of the economy and the financial sector to external shocks, require a cautious approach to further reduction in the base rate. Should the economic situation is significantly improved and persistent signs of stabilization in the financial market are present, further cuts are possible. The decision on the base rate was made with the account of the following factors. For 10 months of 2016 inflation amounted to 6.2%, which corresponds to the historical trend. Possible deviations of the annual inflation from the target at the end of 2016 will be determined by the factors that are outside of the influence of the National Bank. At the same time, according to the estimates of the National Bank, the annual inflation will be sustainably within the target range of 6- 8% throughout the whole year of 2017 in the absence of negative shocks. Inflation expectations of households show a moderate pattern. The recent poll showed that in October the share of respondents expecting the current growth rates of prices during the next 12 months has increased insignificantly. Hence, the households' perception of inflation is improving, which contributes to the decrease in their pro-inflationary behavior. Fluctuations in oil prices and in the exchange rates of a number of currencies of developed and developing countries, as well as a short-term market reaction to the election results in the United States, in fact had almost no effect on the downward trend of the devaluation expectations of market participants. The number of respondents, assuming stability or appreciation of tenge, continues to increase. Deposit market indicators suggest resumption of de-dollarization and currency preferences of investors shifting toward tenge. The share of deposits denominated in foreign currency decreased from 58.3% in September to a level below 57% in October 2016, according to preliminary data. The signs of economic recovery remain. In September 2016 the short-term economic indicator, which represents tendencies in the development of main sectors of economy, increased by 2.3% in annual terms overcoming accumulated fall during the previous months (during the 9 months of 2016 growth rate of the indicator accounted for 0%). However, risks which may deteriorate economic conditions persist. Current situation in the world oil market shows that there is a considerable uncertainty about its future development. An expected by markets rise in the key interest rate of the Federal Reserve and the results of the US presidential elections increase the risk of changes in international capital flows and market quotations. Continued fiscal imbalances in Kazakhstan and in the countries - trade partners, as well as uncertainty about their prompt solution increase the likelihood of the pass-through of the resulting possible economic shocks on Kazakhstan. The presence of these risks on the background of the declining annual inflation in 2017 restrains the further rapid cuts in the base rate. The risks for price stability and confidence in the tenge at lower levels of interest rates may increase, including the risks performing through the channels and variables that the National Bank is observing with a substantial lag and over which the National Bank has a limited control, especially at the short-term horizon. In such circumstances, the decision to further cut the base rate will require a more cautious approach and a thorough rationale. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on January 9, 2017 at 17.00 Astana time."
Armenia,2016-11-15,"Press Release 15.11.2016 At the November 15, 2016 meeting, the Board of the CBA decided to cut the Refinancing Rate by 0.25 pp, setting it at 6.5%. October posted price inflation of 0.5% as opposed to 0.4% of deflation recorded in the same month of the previous year, whereas the 12-month deflation rate amounted to 0.9%. According to the CBA estimates, the deflationary environment will keep on softening up until the end of the year. A slow pace of global economic growth persisted while some inflationary patterns were observable in international commodity markets. The CBA Board estimates, however, that significant inflationary effects from the external sector are not yet likely in the upcoming months. The CBA Board notes that economic activity continues to slow down mainly due to supply factors, such as slowing growth rates in industry and agriculture sectors, whereas expansionary monetary and fiscal policies implemented in the period 2015-2016 largely contribute to the recovery of domestic demand. In the first quarter of 2017 gas and electricity tariffs are expected to reduce; this is a supply factor and would lead to some decrease of prices only in the short run. However, the CBA Board believes that deflation risks in the medium-term remain, which are now added by the 2017 fiscal policy factor. In this case, easing of monetary conditions to a certain extent is still appropriate. Thus, in the light of continued expansionary monetary policy, the deflationary environment will largely phase out in the upcoming months, and the 12-month inflation rate will return to its target in the forecast horizon. At the same time, if additional risks emerge, the CBA will react to them accordingly by fulfilling the inflation target in the medium term. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program. Q4, 2016) to be published on November 25, 2016. Press Service of the CBA."
Peru,2016-11-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR NOVEMBER 2016 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is consistent with an inflation forecast in which inflation is gradually converging to 2.0 percent in the monetary policy horizon and takes into account that: 12-Month inflation expectations are within the target range; The effects of the rise in the prices of some food products and fuels on the rate of inflation in September and October have been transitory, so inflation is expected to converge soon to the inflation target range; Local economic activity has been growing at a rate close to its potential growth level, and The global economy continues showing mixed signals of recovery in production and employment, as well as increased uncertainty in international financial markets. In this scenario, the Peruvian economy maintains sound fundamentals. The Board oversees new data on inflation and inflation determinants in the forecast horizon to evaluate the convenience of making additional adjustments in the monetary policy rate. Inflation is expected to register rates around 3.0 percent in 2016 and 2.0 percent in 2017. Inflation in October showed a rate of 0.41 percent due to rises in the prices of some food products, as a result of which the year-to-year rate of inflation rose from 3.13 percent in September to 3.41 percent in October. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.12 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate declined from 3.01 percent to 3.00 percent. Inflation expectations continue to show a declining path within the target range in the next two years. Indicators of business expectations still show high levels and remain on the optimistic side. In line with this. GDP is expected to grow 3.8 percent in 2016 and 4.2 percent in 2017. However, the indicators associated with construcion and manufacturing have fallen in the past three months due to the weakness of investment. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for December on December 15, 2016."
Chile,2016-11-17,"Santiago. Chile. Thursday, 17 November 2016 Monetary Policy Meeting  November 2016 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3.5%. Internationally, the volatility of financial markets increased after the US elections. It is worth noting the appreciation of the dollar and especially the rise in long-term rates. Financial conditions facing emerging economies worsened, but remain better than they were early in the year. Commodity prices have posted mixed movements. The prices of metals—especially copper—increased, while those for oil and derivatives fell. Activity indicators and prospects show no important change, but the potential effects of recent events have yet to become apparent. In October, the monthly CPI variation was again unexpectedly low, driving annual inflation to 2.8%. At short terms, inflation expectations have dropped, but are near the target at the end of the projection horizon. In the third quarter, domestic output and demand behaved in line with forecasts in the September Monetary Policy Report. Accordingly, the labor market continues to adjust gradually. Long-term interest rates have increased. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2016-11-17,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release November 17, 2016 In its meeting held on November 17, 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 1475 percent, 1575 percent, and 1525 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1525 percen. Annual headline inflation declined to 1356 percent in October 2016 from 1409 percent in September 2016 due to a favorable base effect, as the monthly rate rose by 170 percent in October from 125 percent in Septembe. The bulk of the monthly increase occurred due to core items, particularly food, education and retail, while volatile food prices decline. Consequently annual core inflation rose to 1572 percent in October 2016 from 1393 percent in September 2016, and the monthly rate rose by 281 percent in October from 139 percent in Septembe. Despite elevated inflation rates in October 2016, the contribution of the pass-through from previous exchange rate movements as well as the estimated decline of potential output growth at current demand levels remained moderat. Annual real GDP reportedly grew by 43 percent in the fiscal year 2015/16 compared 44 percent in 2014/1. Labor market data show that the unemployment rate narrowed to 125 percent in the quarter ending June 2016 after peaking at 134 percent in the quarter ending December 2013, supported by lower real unit labor costs relative to productivit. The unemployment rate inched up to 126 percent in the quarter ending September 201. Looking ahead, annual inflation is expected to be impacted by transitory cost-push factors stemming from the economic reform measures before beginning to narro. At the same time, the liberalization of the foreign exchange market in addition to fiscal and structural reform measures are expected to increase potential output growth, which coupled with weaker demand  partly due to tighter monetary conditions  is estimated to partly offset cost-push pressure. Developments in the external economic environment show that there has been some firming of international commodity prices, while low global inflation and subdued growth support low cost-push and demand-pull pressures on domestic prices, respectivel. From the monetary perspective, broad and reserve money growth are likely to be impacted going forward by the phasing out of monetary financing of the fiscal deficit as well as relatively higher foreign reserves accumulatio. Based on the targeted reserve money and the inflation outlook assessed in the extraordinary MPC meeting on November 3, 2016, tightening monetary conditions was warranted, and the CBE raised its key policy rates by 300 basis points and absorbed excess liquidity via longer-term deposit auction. At this juncture and given the balance of risks, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriat. The MPC reiterates its price stability mandate and will continue to closely monitor all economic and monetary developments, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Hungary,2016-11-22,"At its meeting on 22 November 2016, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 23 November 2016:. In the Council's assessment. Hungarian economic growth continues to pick up from the end of the year following the temporary slowdown. There continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflation remains persistently below the Bank's target. Looking ahead, the disinflationary impact of the domestic real economic environment is gradually decreasing. Inflation rose further in October 2016, in line with the Bank's expectations. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation continue to indicate a moderate inflationary environment in the economy. Persistently low global inflation is restraining the pace of increase in domestic consumer prices. Inflation expectations are at historically low levels. Whole-economy wage growth remains strong, which is likely to raise core inflation gradually through rising household consumption. Inflation remains below the 3 per cent target over the forecast period, and only gets close to it by the middle of 2018. The Hungarian economy grew by 2 per cent in the third quarter of 2016 relative to the same period a year earlier. The robust expansion in retail sales continued in September. In the coming quarters household consumption is expected to grow further, thus consumption expenditures remain determining factors of economic growth. Industrial production fell in September compared to a year earlier. The growth rate of the sector's output moderated significantly in the third quarter, reflecting among other things the temporary fall in vehicle industry output. Labour demand remained strong, and therefore the number of employees increased again, while the unemployment rate fell further. Both corporate and household lending rose in September. Sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile since the Council's latest interest rate-setting decision, mainly driven by expectations about the US presidential elections and about an interest rate increase by the Fed as well as by news related to the European banking sector. Developed market equity indices had a mixed performance, while bond prices fell. The forint remained broadly unchanged against the euro. Due to international developments, the yield curve of government securities shifted upwards at both the middle and the long end, thus the curve steepened. Hungary's strong external financing capacity and the decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. All of these developments contributed significantly to the upgrade of the country's sovereign rating by Moody's. This meant that Hungary's sovereign rating was raised to investment grade by all three leading international rating agencies. Forward-looking domestic money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are declining even further as inflation rises. In the Council's assessment, a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. At its meeting in September, the Monetary Council set a HUF 900 billion upper limit on the 2016 year-end stock of three-month central bank deposits, which according to the Council's expectation, means crowding out of at least HUF 200400 billion liquidity from the deposit facility. The Council considers the limit on the three-month deposit stock and its potential future change an integral part of monetary policy instruments. The Bank aims to ease monetary conditions and provide a corresponding degree of support to the economy through a decline in money market rates. The Monetary Council aims to ensure that the limit imposed on the stock of three-month deposits exerts its expected easing effect efficiently. The Monetary Council decided to leave the base rate unchanged. In order to ease monetary conditions further, the Council reduced the overnight lending rate by 15 basis points to 0.90 per cent while leaving the overnight deposit rate unchanged at -0.05 per cent. As a result, the interest rate corridor narrowed further. In accordance with this, the Council also lowered the interest rate on the one-week central bank loan by 10 basis points to 0.90 per cent. In the Council's assessment, there continues to be a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflation remains moderate for an extended period. The disinflationary impact of the real economy is gradually decreasing over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, maintaining the current level of the base rate for an extended period and the loosening of monetary conditions by the change in the monetary policy instruments are consistent with the medium-term achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank monitors developments in monetary conditions and markets. If subsequently warranted by the achievement of the inflation target, the Council will stand ready to ease monetary conditions further using unconventional, targeted instruments."
Nigeria,2016-11-22,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No 110 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of st nd Monday and Tuesday 21 and 22 November 2016 st The Monetary Policy Committee met on 21 and nd 22 November 2016, amidst relatively subdued global and domestic economic and financial conditions. The Committee evaluated the global and domestic macroeconomic and financial developments as well as the challenges to the 1 domestic economy up to November 2016, and the outlook for the first quarter of 2017. In attendance were 10 out of 12 members. International Economic Developments The Committee acknowledged the tapered growth in global output, stemming from relatively unbalanced risks to the global economic outlook. Global recovery remains fragile in the advanced economies while the emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) continue to struggle against strong headwinds, including low commodity prices, slowing demand and instability of capital flows. The path to the modest improvements in the advanced economies has increasingly turned fragile owing to persistent uncertainties. While still being expected to unravel, the BREXIT shocks have been rapidly followed by the outcome of the US. Presidential Elections; a development which has created its own uncertainties. Accompanied by the planned referendum in Italy, and general elections in France and Germany, the global political environment could not be more uncertain. In effect, current judgments about growth prospects in the first half of 2017 could be overly optimistic. The IMF's current outlook for global growth for 2016 which was revised to 31 per cent in July and retained in 3 October could be missed by a significant margin. The World Bank has been more cautious in retaining its June 2016 global output growth projection of 24 per cent. Headwinds to global growth prospects are also emanating from weak trade and financial conditions. The OECD' Economic Forecast. September 2016 Update, emphasized that both elements underpin the current low-growth trap facing the global economy. The United States (US) economy exceeded it's growth expectation in Q3 2016, growing at an annual rate of 29 per cent, a significant uptick from the average growth rate of 11 per cent in H1 2016. The enhanced performance of the economy was attributed largely to the growth of inventories and robust surge in exports, coupled with improved consumer spending, even as the mining sector recorded a pull back. Japan's economy grew at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 02 per cent in Q2 of 2016 compared with 17 per cent in Q1 of 2016. The moderation in growth was largely attributed to weak wage growth and a strong yen. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) in a rare move at its September MPC meeting set a target for government bond yields and introduced an inflation-overshooting commitment. The Bank voted to apply an interest rate of minus 01 per cent to the policy rate on balances in current accounts held by financial institutions. The Bank also announced a plan to purchase Japanese Government bonds up to JPY 80 trillion (approximately USD788 billion), among series of policy measures taken towards achieving the price stability target of 2 per cent. The government had, in August, approved a fiscal stimulus of ¥135 trillion (US$132 billion) in a spirited attempt to jumpstart the economy. Real GDP in the Euro area is expected to maintain or outperform its Q2 growth rate of 03 per cent in 6 the third quarter. While short-term downside risks from the Brexit vote have largely subsided, the long- term potential economic impact remains uncertain. As such, the zone's growth path remains th challenged. At its October 20 , 2016 meeting, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank decided to retain its key interest rates on refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility at 000, 025 and -040 per cent, respectively. The Council also reaffirmed its commitment to sustain its quantitative easing programme of monthly asset purchases of €80 billion (US$856 billion) until March 2017 and beyond, as economic conditions dictate. The growth outlook for the UK in 2016 was upgraded to 18 per cent from 17 per cent, although that for 2017 was downgraded to 11 per cent from 13 per cent. The Bank of England (BoE), at its nd November 2 meeting, decided to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 025 per cent as part of its earlier commitment to support output recovery in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. In addition, the Committee voted to continue its quantitative easing programme of £435 billion. Whereas some Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) continue to contend with low capital inflow and unstable macroeconomic 8 environment, the prospects for their recovery look more promising. The IMF (WEO October 2016 Update) projected growth rate of 42 per cent, an upward review from 41 per cent projected in July 2016 for the EMDEs. The marginal improvement in growth outlook is expected to be powered by improvements in India and China. Global inflation rose moderately in response to rising prices in the advanced economies due to the modest recovery in oil prices. However their central banks are expected to stay the course on accommodative monetary policy. Following the Brexit vote and the recent outcome of the US 9 Presidential Elections and uncertainties surrounding both events as well as the regime of negative interest rates and heavy fiscal and monetary stimuli in Japan and elsewhere, we expect a resurgence of aggregate demand and even higher price increases. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in August showed that the economy slipped into recession following a second consecutive contraction in Q2, 2016. Domestic output contracted in the quarter by 206 per cent. The latest release in 10 November 2016 by the NBS shows that real income actually worsened in Q3, 2016 as output contracted further by 224 per cent relative to its level in the previous and corresponding quarter of 2015. The non-oil sector grew by 003 per cent, driven by Agriculture which grew by 454 per cent, following the 038 per cent contraction in Q2 2016,. The MPC noted that the key undercurrents  shortage of foreign exchange, low fiscal activity, high energy prices and the accumulation of salary arrears, especially at the sub-national levels of government  continued in the third quarter of the year. Members also noted that those conditions 11 could not have been ameliorated directly with monetary policy instruments. It however, recognized the need to continue to engineer monetary policy in such a way as to enable fiscal policy the required space to improve public investment in infrastructure. Prices The Committee noted that headline inflation (year- on-year) continued to rise in October 2016 to 183 from 179 per cent in September and 176 per cent in August, 2016, thus maintaing the upward momentum since January 2016. The increase in headline inflation in October reflected increases in 12 both the food and core components of inflation. Core and food inflation increased from 177 and 166 per cent in September to 181 and 171 per cent, respectively, in October, 2016. The Committee also noted the less rapid movement in the month-on-month CPI between September and October. Headline inflation index (month-on-month) rose by 083 per cent in October, from 081 per cent in September, contrasting the successive declines since May 2016. Similarly the core index has been increasing at a slower pace since May when it rose by 27 per cent. It moderated to 075 per cent in October from 096 in September. similar pattern is noted with the food (month-on-month) index which 13 rose by 086 per cent in October from 081 per cent in September. The MPC observed that the incessant pressure on consumer prices continues to come from structural factors including high cost of power and energy, transport, production factors, as well as rising prices of imports. Monetary Credit and Financial Markets Developments Broad money supply (M2) grew by 1050 per cent in September, 2016, compared with the 808 per cent in August, 2016. When annualized. M2 grew by 140 14 per cent in September 2016, above the growth benchmark of 1098 per cent for 2016. Net domestic credit (NDC) grew by 2188 per cent in the same period, annualized at 2917 per cent. At this rate, the growth rate of NDC was above the provisional benchmark of 1794 per cent for 2016. The development in NDC, essentially reflected the relative growth in credit to the private sector of 2069 per cent in September, annualized to 2759 per cent. Credit to government grew by 2957 per cent in the review period, which annualized to a growth of 3943 per cent compared with the growth benchmark of 1328 per cent for fiscal 2016. The growth in 15 government borrowing was largely to compensate for the continued decline in oil receipts. Money market interest rates oscillated in tandem with the level of liquidity in the banking system. Thus average inter-bank call rate, which stood at th 1150 per cent on 11 October 2016, closed at 1502 per cent on November 17, 2016. Between these periods the interbank call rate averaged 1168 per cent. However the average interbank call rates fell to 1000 per cent on October 24, 2016, following net government financing of N14900 billion between October 18 and 28, 2016 and the payment on th October 24 2016 from statutory revenue allocation of N17400 billion. 16 The Committee noted a decline in the equities segment of the capital market as the All-Share Index (ASI) fell by 733 per cent from 27,,83993 on September 19, 2016, to 25,,79788 on November 16, 2016. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) declined by 711 per cent from N956 trillion to 888 trillion during the same period. In addition, relative to end- December 2015, the capital market indices fell by 993 per cent and 985 per cent, respectively, reflecting the challenges facing the economy. External Sector Developments The average naira exchange rate weakened at the inter-bank segment of the foreign exchange market 17 during the review period. The exchange rate at the interbank market opened at N30500/US$ and st closed at N30590/US$ between September 1 and October 27, 2016. The Committee observed that total foreign exchange inflows through the CBN decreased by 3185 per cent, from US$1,,40484 million in September to US$95737 million in October 2016. The decrease was due to lower crude oil and other government revenues in the period under review. In spite of the resumed Joint Venture payments in October, total outflows also continued to decrease, dropping significantly by 5868 per cent from US$2,,45686 million to US$1,,01508 million during the same period. 18 The Committee also implored the Management to continue to direct more focus at making foreign exchange available to agriculture and manufacturing sectors of the economy by enforcing its policy directing DMBs to allocate 60 per cent of the FX available to these sectors. The MPC believes that the Security agencies should sustain their checks on the activities of illegal foreign exchange operators in order to bring sanity to that segment of the market. The Committee reiterated that the extant foreign exchange regulation outlaws the trafficking of currency on the streets as some unlicensed operators currently do. Thus to evolve 19 an appropriate naira exchange rate that stabilizes the foreign exchange market. BDC operators must strictly observe the terms and conditions of their license. The Committee's Considerations The Committee assessed the fragile macroeconomic conditions and the strong headwinds confronting the economy. In particular, the Committee considered the implications of the twin deficits of current account and budget deficits, the rise of nationalist sentiments across the West and implications for national elections in France and Germany as well as 20 the forthcoming referendum in Italy. Other considerations include the yet to be unveiled long term uncertainties of Brexit and expectations of significant shifts in US economic policy. The Committee reaffirmed the urgency of prioritizing the diversification of the economy given the emerging gloomy protectionist outlook of the global economy. The Committee also evaluated the impact of its July and September 2016 actions on the macroeconomy noting that while foreign exchange inflows into the economy had improved significantly in July and August, it declined after the September MPC meeting, leading to rising inflation and increasing 21 negative real interest rates. However outflows significantly dropped, lending credence to the propriety of the decisions of the July and September MPC meetings. The MPC reiterated the limitations of monetary policy in reversing the current stagflationary condition in the economy, which it traced to supply and demand shocks. Members stressed the need for a robust and more keenly coordinated macroeconomic policy framework that would restart output growth, stimulate aggregate demand and rein in inflation expectations. Consequently the MPC welcomes efforts at resuscitating planning, noting 22 the progress made in developing the medium term economic recovery plan. The MPC urged the Federal Government to urgently assess the extent of its indebtedness to domestic economic agents and develop a framework for securitizing the debts in order to settle its outstanding domestic contractual obligations which cuts across all sectors of the economy. These accumulated debts have slowed business activities of economic agents; most of who are indebted to the banking system, thus compromising the integrity of the financial system. It also advised the Bank to commit to greater surveillance and deployment of early warning systems in managing the banking system. 23 Overall, members called for an enrichment of fiscal and other sector initiatives and interventions towards resolving the growth challenges in the economy in order to promptly revive confidence in the economy. Outlook Available data and forecasts of key economic variables indicate that the outlook for growth and inflation in the medium term continues to be challenging. Growth is expected to remain less robust given the absence of sufficient fiscal space while the current tight stance of monetary policy and 24 improved agricultural harvests are expected to contain further price increases and moderate price expectations as the trend has already revealed. 25 The Committee's Decisions The Committee assessed the relevant risks to the global and domestic economy and concluded that the risks to the economy remained highly elevated on two fronts (price and output). However considering the importance of price stability, and being mindful of the limitations of monetary policy in influencing output and employment under conditions of stagflation, the Committee decided unanimously in favour of retaining the current stance of monetary policy, thus keeping the MPR at 140 per cent alongside all other policy parameters. In summary, all 10 MPC members voted to: 26 Retain the MPR at 14 per cent; Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 3000 per cent; and Retain the Asymmetric Window at +200 and -500 basis points around the MPR Thank you for listening.

Malaysia,2016-11-23,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy continued to grow at a moderate pace. Economic activity in major advanced economies has improved but remains moderate. In Asia, growth has been supported by domestic demand amid persistent weakness in the external sector. Looking ahead, the baseline estimate is for global growth to improve slightly in 2017. The prospect of a shift towards progressive use of fiscal policy in the developed economies could lead to a more balanced policy environment that would support growth going forward. Nevertheless there is uncertainty arising from risks of protectionism and financial market volatility. Heightened financial market volatility in recent weeks has had an adverse effect on various asset classes, exchange rates and yields across many emerging economies. Global financial market conditions are likely to be susceptible to policy and market developments. The domestic economy continued to expand in the third quarter of the year, driven mainly by private sector activity with some support from net exports. Going forward, private sector activity will remain the key driver of growth. Private consumption is expected to be sustained by continued wage and employment growth, with additional support from Government measures to increase disposable income. Investment activity, although moderating, will be supported by on-going infrastructure investments and capital expenditure in the manufacturing and services sectors. On the external front, exports are expected to expand but will be constrained by soft demand from Malaysia's key trading partners. Overall, the domestic economy remains on track to expand as projected in 2016 and 2017. Headline inflation for 2016 is expected to be at the lower end of the projected range of 2.0%  2.5%. Inflation is expected to remain relatively stable in 2017 given the environment of low global energy and commodity prices, and generally subdued global inflation. The ringgit, along with most emerging market currencies, has experienced sharp adjustments and significant volatility due to continuing uncertainties in global economic and policy environment, and geopolitical developments. These factors could result in periods of volatility in the regional financial and foreign exchange markets. In this regard. Bank Negara Malaysia will continue to provide liquidity to ensure the orderly functioning of the domestic foreign exchange market. The capital market remains accessible, deep and liquid. Banking system liquidity is ample. Financial institutions continue to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers and the growth of financing to the private sector is consistent with the pace of economic activity. At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path amid stable inflation, supported by continued healthy financial intermediation in the economy. The risk of destabilising financial imbalances has been contained. However, the MPC will be monitoring these risks to ensure the sustainability of the overall growth prospects. The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2017. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times during the year. The meetings will be held over two days, with the Monetary Policy Statement released at 3 p.m. on the second day of the MPC meeting. Schedule of Monetary Policy Committee Meetings for 2017. 18 and 19 January 2017 (Wednesday and Thursday). 1 and 2 March 2017 (Wednesday and Thursday). 12 and 13 July 2017 (Wednesday and Thursday). 6 and 7 September 2017 (Wednesday and Thursday). 8 and 9 November 2017 (Wednesday and Thursday). Bank Negara Malaysia 23 November 2016."
Turkiye,2016-11-24,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been increased from 8.25 percent to 8.5 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,. b) One-week repo rate has been increased from 7.5 percent to 8 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been increased from 9.75 percent to 10 percent. Recently released data indicate a deceleration in the economic activity for the third quarter. Meanwhile, demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports. With the supportive measures and incentives provided recently, economic activity is expected to recover starting from the final quarter. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. The slowdown in aggregate demand contributes to the fall in inflation. Yet, exchange rate movements due to recently heightened global uncertainty and volatility pose upside risks on the inflation outlook. The Committee decided to implement monetary tightening to contain adverse impact of these developments on expectations and the pricing behavior. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2016-11-24,"South African Reserve Bank EMBARGO DELIVERY 24 November 2016 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the global economic and political landscape has changed significantly following the US presidential election. The high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic policies of the new administration is expected to persist for some time, creating a more challenging and volatile environment for emerging markets in particular. Higher US long bond yields, along with expectations of a tighter stance of monetary policy by the US Fed than previously expected, have contributed to the reversal of the recent positive sentiment towards emerging markets. The prospect of rising protectionism and its implications for world trade are also a concern. These developments have also affected capital flows to South Africa, with implications for the rand and bond yields. Domestic growth and inflation dynamics have remained more or less in line with expectations, but risks to the inflation outlook have increased moderately. 1 The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 6,1 per cent and 6,4 per cent in September and October respectively, compared with 5,9 per cent in August. The October outcome was marginally above the Bank's forecast. Food price inflation accelerated further to a recent high of 12,0 per cent, with the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages contributing 1,8 percentage points to the overall inflation outcome. Goods price inflation measured 7,1 per cent in October, up from 6,6 per cent in September, with non-durable goods inflation increasing to 7,6 per cent. Services price inflation increased from 5,6 per cent to 5,8 per cent. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity measured 5,7 per cent, up from 5,6 per cent. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 6,6 per cent in September and October, down from 7,2 per cent in August. The main contributor to the October outcome was the category of food products, beverages and tobacco products which contributed 4,0 percentage points, and reflects the continued impact of the drought on food prices. The latest inflation forecast of the Bank is broadly unchanged over the forecast period, despite a moderate upward adjustment to the food price forecast in the later quarters. The annual averages are unchanged at 6,4 per cent for 2016, and 5,8 per cent and 5,5 per cent in the coming two years. Inflation is expected to peak at 6,6 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year, marginally lower than in the previous forecast, with a sustained return to within the target range still expected to occur 2. Inflation is expected to peak at 6,6 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year, marginally lower than in the previous forecast, with a sustained return to within the target range still expected to occur 2 during the second quarter of 2017. The higher food price assumption is offset by a slightly more appreciated exchange rate assumption. Core inflation is expected to average 0,1 percentage point less in each year of the forecast period, compared with the previous forecast, at 5,6 per cent this year, and 5,5 per cent and 5,2 per cent in 2017 and 2018. Core inflation is expected to remain within the target range over the forecast period, with a peak of 5,8 per cent in the final quarter of this year. The annual inflation expectations of economic analysts, as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in November, are broadly unchanged since September, and are similar to those of the Bank. The median forecast for the current and next two years are 6,3 per cent, 5,8 per cent and 5,6 per cent. Bond market expectations implicit in the breakeven inflation rates, i.e. the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation-linked bonds, increased in the wake of the recent depreciation of the rand. They remain above the upper end of the inflation target range. The global outlook has become increasingly uncertain during the year following the UK decision to leave the European Union, and the outcome of the US presidential election. While the new policy direction in the US is still unclear, the markets have interpreted the outcome as being positive for US growth in the short run, with commitments to tax cuts and higher fiscal spending on infrastructure. These policies are expected to result in higher growth and inflation, particularly against the backdrop of an increasingly tight labour market. Nevertheless, the timing and extent of the expenditure boost is highly uncertain at this stage. 3 While an increase in infrastructure expenditure could be positive for commodity prices, other aspects of the possible new policy direction are likely to have an adverse effect on emerging markets. These include a possible more aggressive tightening of US monetary policy in response to higher inflation and growth, which could also reduce the multiplier effect of the fiscal expansion. Together with the recent sharp increase in US long bond yields, the possibility of such actions has led to a reversal of capital flows to emerging markets, reminiscent of the market reaction to the so-called US taper tantrum in 2013. The impact on emerging market currencies and bond markets, including in South Africa, are already evident. Given the high degree of uncertainty, the financial markets may have over-reacted. A further concern for emerging markets is the potential change of trade policies that may impact on existing trade treaties, as well as unilateral increases in tariff protection in the US. The outlook for emerging markets has therefore become more uncertain. The lingering concerns about the sustainability of the recovery in the Chinese economy have been revived by the possibility of tariff increases on Chinese exports. Countries with strong direct trade links with the US, in particular Mexico, are most vulnerable to increased trade barriers. A more protectionist US stance could reinforce the already slow growth of global trade. The short-term fallout of Brexit on the UK economy has been limited to date, due in part to the accommodative monetary policy response. The longer-term impact remains unclear as the terms of withdrawal are still to be negotiated, and there are concerns that a delay in clarity could undermine investment. The Eurozone is expected to continue with its slow but steady recovery, and the Japanese economy continues to battle with deflation. 4 Global inflation remains generally benign and since the previous meeting of the MPC a number of countries have loosened monetary policy. Expansionary policies are expected to persist in the Eurozone. Japan and the UK, despite emerging inflation pressures in the latter. By contrast, a persistence of significant outflows from emerging markets in response to the possibility of a tighter US monetary policy stance could pose challenges for monetary policies in a number of these economies. These new global developments have impacted on the domestic bond and foreign exchange markets. The rand appreciated steadily from the middle of October in response to some positive domestic developments, as well as inflows from a large M&A transaction. The currency was trading at around R13,20 against the US dollar just before the elections. It then reached its weakest point of R14,60 against the US dollar in the wake of the surprise outcome, before recovering somewhat. Domestic long bond yields (R186) initially spiked by about 60 basis points, but the increase has since moderated to about 25 basis points. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has depreciated by about 5,7 per cent against the US dollar, and by about 1,1 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The rand is expected to remain sensitive to changes in the stance of US monetary policy. A US rate increase is generally expected in December and probably largely priced in, but of greater significance for the rand will be the signals from the FOMC regarding the trajectory of future increases. The rand will also remain sensitive to the sovereign ratings announcements due later this month and early in December. On the positive side, the rand has been given support by the generally improved trade account in recent months. However, the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments is expected to have widened in the third quarter of this year. 5 The financing of the deficit may become more challenging should the recent significant non-resident sales of bonds and equities persist. During October and month-to-date, non-residents have been net sellers of domestic bonds and equities to the value of R42,7 bn and R19,7 bn respectively. The domestic economic growth outlook remains subdued, although the low point of the cycle appears to be behind us. The Bank's forecast remains unchanged at 0,4 per cent for 2016, and 1,2 per cent and 1,6 per cent for the next two years. While the estimate for potential GDP growth was revised down marginally to 1,3 per cent, and rising to 1,5 per cent by 2018, the output gap is expected to remain negative over the forecast period. The Bank's composite leading business cycle indicator improved in August and September, continuing a recent generally positive but gradual upward trend. Available monthly data suggest that growth in the third quarter is likely to be positive but well below the rate recorded in the second quarter. The mining sector contributed positively to GDP growth in the quarter. The physical volume of manufacturing output declined, despite a positive month-to-month outcome in September. The Barclays Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which declined further in October, has remained below the neutral 50 index point level for three consecutive months. The weak trends in manufacturing are consistent with the continued low levels of business confidence, despite a moderate improvement in the third quarter. More positively, the services sector is expected to sustain its positive growth rate, with the tourism sector being particularly buoyant. 6 Consumption expenditure by households remains subdued, with declining retail trade sales, and static wholesale trade sales in the third quarter of this year. Although new motor vehicle sales increased sharply on a month-to-month basis in October, a sizeable proportion of this is attributed to car rental companies, and challenging conditions in the new vehicle sector persist. Consumers continue to face a number of constraints. Employment growth is particularly weak; household debt levels, while moderating, are still elevated; and wealth effects are muted amid stagnant equity and residential property markets. Furthermore, growth in credit extension to households remains subdued. Slow growth in household disposable incomes is also reflected in a gradual decline in wage growth, with growth in nominal remuneration per worker declining to 5,8 per cent in the second quarter. When an adjustment is made for the increase in labour productivity, growth over four quarters in nominal unit labour costs measured 5,1 per cent in the second quarter. The Andrew Levy Employment Publications Survey reports an average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements of 7,5 per cent in the first three quarters of the year, and 7,1 per cent in the third quarter. This may be indicative of wage settlements becoming more sensitive to the persistently high unemployment rates. According to the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) released in October, fiscal consolidation is set to continue at a measured pace. A moderate degree of slippage is expected in the near term, as tax receipts are negatively affected by the economic slowdown. In order to prevent an excessive widening of the fiscal deficit, the MTBPS proposes a reduction in the expenditure ceiling and tax increases to be announced in February. A revised deficit of 3,4 per cent of GDP is 7. A revised deficit of 3,4 per cent of GDP is 7 expected in the current fiscal year, and steadily narrowing to 2,5 per cent of GDP in the 2019/20 fiscal year. Food price inflation remains a significant driver of inflation, and is sensitive to the continuing drought. While food price inflation is still expected to moderate from early 2017, the pace of decline is expected to be slower than previously forecast. This has led to an upward revision to the food price assumption in the forecast during the outer quarters in particular. The change is mainly due to the delayed impact of meat prices which are now expected to peak only in early 2018, as farmers rebuild their herds during 2017. Brent crude oil prices reached a year high of US$52 per barrel in early October following the OPEC agreement to curtail production. Since then, prices have declined following doubts about the prospects for an agreement on the distribution of production cuts across the cartel. Some price volatility is expected in the short run as negotiations on production cuts continue. The Bank's forecast maintains the assumption of a moderate upward trajectory of international oil prices over the forecast period. The domestic price of 93 octane petrol increased by a cumulative 88 cents per litre in October and November, with almost all of the increase due to higher international product prices. The current over-recovery indicates that should current trends persist, about half of that increase could be reversed in December. 8 The MPC is of the view that a high degree of uncertainty surrounds the nature and timing of possible policy changes emanating from significant developments in the global economic environment. This elevated uncertainty creates a more challenging environment especially for emerging markets as evidenced in the recent changed pattern of capital flows. Financial markets are thus likely to remain volatile for some time. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the inflation forecast has remained largely unchanged. Whereas the risks to the inflation forecast were previously assessed to be more or less balanced, the Committee now assesses the risks to be moderately to the upside. This is mainly due to the possible impact of adverse global developments on the exchange rate. The risk of domestically generated shocks to the exchange rate also remain. Nevertheless, despite its high degree of volatility, the rand has displayed relative resilience in the face of numerous shocks over the past year. The domestic growth outlook is unchanged and remains constrained against the backdrop of weak business and consumer confidence. The risks to the growth forecast are assessed to be broadly balanced. Domestic demand pressures remain weak, and consumers are expected to remain under pressure for some time. The MPC has accordingly decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7,0 per cent per annum. The MPC remains concerned that the inflation trajectory is uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. Furthermore, the uncertain environment and moderately higher risks to the inflation outlook require continued vigilance. While the 9 Committee retains the view that we may be close to the end of the hiking cycle, there may be a reassessment of this position should the upside risks transpire.

Colombia,2016-11-25,"Pgina relacionada. Minutes of the Meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica on Friday. November 25, 2016. The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, in accordance with Act 31 of 1992, confirms that the inflation target is 3.0%, and reiterates that the monetary policy actions undertaken so far are aimed at driving inflation to a range of 3.0% =C2=B1 1 pp in 2017 and consolidate its convergence to 3.0%. A low and stable inflation is the best contribution that monetary policy can provide to sustainable growth of output and employment. The Board also decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 7.75%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In October, yearly consumer inflation and the average of core inflation indicators decreased, reaching 6.48% and 6.03%, respectively. Analysts' inflation expectations to one and two years posted at 4.18% and 3.57%, respectively, and those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years are between 3.9% and 4.2%. The effects of the strong transitory supply shocks that diverted inflation from the target are beginning to fade at a slightly higher pace than expected. This is suggested by the slowdown in the food CPI and the recent behavior of the prices that were mostly impacted in the past by the strong nominal depreciation. Global economic activity remains weak, and it is likely that it will register a slight recovery in 2017. A gradual tightening of the US monetary policy is projected. Due to the increased global uncertainty, the US dollar has strengthened, long-term interest rates have increased, the international price of oil declined, and the risk measures for the major Latin American economies, including Colombia, increased. In this environment, the country's external financing has become more expensive, and the Colombian peso has depreciated. Economic growth for the third quarter was lower than expected. This result and the new figures of economic activity for the fourth quarter suggest that growth in 2016 would be close to 2.0%. The new figures for foreign trade suggest that the external balance is adjusting in line with the forecast of the technical staff of the Central Bank (a current account deficit in 2016 of 4.7% of GDP, equivalent to US 13.2 billion). In all, the Colombian economy continues to adjust to the strong shocks received since 2014, and the current account deficit is narrowing gradually. The dynamics of output have been weaker than forecast, and inflation continues to decline, although the core inflation measures and inflation expectations to a year still exceed the target; also, recent changes in the international context have led to a depreciation of the peso. The effects of several of the transitory supply shocks that affected inflation and inflation expectations continue to reverse, and this trend is expected to continue. The monetary policy actions undertaken so far reinforce the process of convergence of inflation to the target and reaffirm the commitment of the Board to reach the 3.0% =C2=B1 1 pp range in 2017. In this environment, upon assessing the risk balance for inflation and growth, the majority of the Board of Directors deemed appropriate to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered. New data on the behavior of prices and aggregate demand will provide more information about the speed of the expected convergence of inflation to the target, and the intensity, nature, and persistence of the economic slowdown. The Board considers that the structural Tax Reform Bill submitted by the Government to the Congress is a crucial action that contributes to fiscal sustainability and long-term economic growth. Should the tax reform not be approved, this would compromise the credit rating of the country, which would produce inflationary effects associated with a greater depreciation of the peso. The Board will continue to monitor the adjustment of expenditures and its consistency with the long-term income level, the sustainability of the external deficit, and, in general, the macroeconomic stability. Also, it reaffirms its commitment to maintain inflation and its expectations anchored to the target, acknowledging that there has been a transitory increase in inflation. The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate unchanged was approved by five Board Members. The remaining two members of the Board voted for a 25 bp reduction of the benchmark interest rate."
Pakistan,2016-11-26,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Monetary Policy Statement November 26, 2016 After bottoming out in October 2015. CPI inflation has been following rising trend, with sporadic seasonal diversions. This anticipated rise is explained by stability in commodity prices against earlier sharp decline, phasing out of second-round impact of oil prices, and some uptick in domestic demand. The year-on-year CPI inflation has increased from. percent in October 2015 to. percent in October 2016 and core inflation is inching upwards as well. These movements are also partially mirrored in the IBA-SBP survey of November 2016 that shows improvement in current and expected economic conditions along with moderate rise in consumer confidence and inflation expectations for the next six months. This manageable inflationary environment over the near-term bodes well for the current growth momentum. healthy uptick in private sector credit for fixed investment will further support future growth. Consequently improving aggregate supply is expected to better cater to rising domestic demand in FY17. However international oil price movements may impact inflation. The current macroeconomic stability and net retirement of government borrowings from scheduled banks resulted in relatively easy liquidity conditions in the money market. Some support also came from increase in bank deposits as the growth in currency in circulation receded back to its past levels after rising exceptionally high in FY16. Volatility in the interbank market continued to remain low and the overnight money market repo rate stayed close to the policy rate in the post September 2016 monetary policy period. The global growth outlook for 2016 is mixed. While growth prospects for the US economy remain positive, uncertainties exist for international financial markets and global trade amid anticipated interest rate hike by the US-Fed. Nonetheless Pakistan's continuous buildup of external buffers over the last three years has improved its resilience against external uncertainties. This is reflected in the current level of foreign exchange reserves which cover more than four months of projected import payments. In addition, the recent improvement in Pakistan's sovereign rating along with official financial inflows is projected to sustain its foreign exchange reserves. However unpredictability of non-trade flows will influence the current account in particular and the external sector in general during the rest of FY17. Based on above macroeconomic considerations and after detailed deliberations, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to maintain the policy rate at.75 percent. Page."
Israel,2016-11-28,"Inflation data: The Consumer Price Indexfor October increased by 0.2 percent, slightly more than the forecasters' predictions of 0.1 percent, on average. The food component increased by 0.6 percent, while there was a seasonal decline of 0.3 percent in the housing component. The inflation rate as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was -0.3 percent, while the change was -0.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September, and there has been an upward trend in the annual inflation rate since April. Excluding the diminishing direct effect of energy prices and administrative price reductions, the CPI increased by 0.1 percent over the past 12 months. Over the past 12 months, prices of tradable goods in the CPI declined by 1.8 percent, and the prices ofnontradable items increased by 0.5 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: There was no significant change in short-term inflation expectations this month. One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market were 0.3 percent, as were expectations for inflation over the coming 12 months derived from banks' internal interest rates. Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings are for an increase of 0.7 percent, on average. Medium and long-term expectations increased, primarilyafter the US elections. Third-year forward expectations increased from 1.0 percent prior to the previous monetary policy discussion to 1.36 percent, and 3-5 year forward expectations increased from 1.2 percent to 1.45 percent. Longer-term forward expectations (5 to 10 years) increased from 2.25 percent to 2.37 percent. Based on the makam curve, the Telbor curve and forecasters' assessments, there has been an increase in the probability of a rise in the Bank of Israel interest rate in about a year. <b>Real economic activity: The picture of real economic activity remainspositive. National Accounts data for the first half of 2016 were revised upward, and according to the first estimate for the third quarter (seasonally adjust data in annual terms). GDP increased by 3.2 percent and business sector product increased by 3.6 percent, led by fixed capital formation (which increased by 12.8 percent excluding ships and aircraft) and current consumption (which increased by 5.3 percent). Exports (excluding diamonds and startups) declined by 6.3 percent, due to a 13.4 percent decline in manufacturing exports. The increase in investment in the third quarter was concentrated in a single company, but investment has been increasing at a relatively rapid rate for the past four quarters, against the background of the fullemployment environment in which the economy is operating. The effect of vehicle purchases on private consumption and investment declined sharply following a sharp increase in the previous quarter. The Purchasing Managers Index declined in October to 51 points, but has been above the 50-point level that distinguishes between expansion and contraction of activity for the past 4 months. The Consumer Confidence Indices compiled by Bank Hapoalim and by the Central Bureau of Statistics increased in October. The labor market: The picture conveyed by the labor market remains very positive. Labor Force Survey data for October for the prime working ages (25-64) continue to show a high laborforce participation rate (80.1 percent) and employment rate (76.9 percent), and a low unemployment rate (3.9 percent), while the job vacancy rate remains high, at 3.7 percent (seasonally adjusted). The number of employee posts increased in August by 0.25 percent, and has increased by 3.0 percent in the past 12 months. Real wages, which have been in an upward trend in the past two years, increased by 0.5 percent (seasonally adjusted) in June-August compared with the preceding three months, and nominal wages increased by a similar rate. Health tax receipts for August-October were 6.25 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding periodin the year before, reflecting the continued increase in employment and wages. Budget data: The cumulative domestic deficit (excluding net credit) in government activity was NIS 4.4 billion in January-October 2016, compared with a deficit of approximately NIS 4.1 billion in the corresponding period of 2015, and it is about NIS 9.0 billion smaller than the deficit in the seasonal path consistent with achieving the deficit target for 2016. The deviation reflects revenues that were NIS 5.3 billion higher than the path, and expenditures that were about NIS 3.7 billion lower than the path. Tax revenues in October were about NIS 21.8 billion, which is about NIS 0.6 billion higher than the seasonal path consistent with the estimate of tax revenue in the original budget. In October, gross domestic VAT collection was about 1.7 percent lower in real terms compared with October of 2015. <b>The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on October 26, 2016, through November 25, 2016, the shekel weakened by 0.8 percent against the dollar, and appreciated by 1.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the preceding 12 months, the shekel appreciated by 3.0 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: The results of the elections in the US led to a sharp increasein bond yields and to significant strengthening of the dollar around the world, primarily against emerging market currencies. In Israel, from the monetary policy discussion on October 26, 2016, through November 24, 2016, theTel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 1.5 percent. Government bond yields increased by up to 37 basis points along the unindexed curve, and increased by up to 19 basis points along the CPI-indexed curve, with a steepening of the curves. The makam curve traded at a yield above the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, increased slightly, to about 74 basis points. The money supply: In the 12 months ending in October, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demanddeposits) increased by 19.6 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 9.0 percent. The credit market: In October, the business sector (excluding banks, insurance companies and foreign companies) issued just NIS 500 million in bonds, a low level due to the lack of trading days and following record issuance of NIS 10.9 billion in September. The average monthly issuance in the past year is about NIS 3.6 billion. Corporate bond spreads (excluding banks and insurance companies) increased slightly at the beginning of November, to 3.04 percentage points, on average. In October, the total volume of new mortgages taken out was just NIS 2.8 billion, against the background of the lack of business days as a result of the highholidays. Over the past year, there has been a moderate downward trend in monthly mortgage volume. The average interest rate on mortgages continued to increase in October on all tracks. On the fixed-rate CPI-indexed track, rates increased by 0.11 percentage points, and on the variable-rate CPI-indexed track, rates increased by 0.18 percentage points. The interest rate on the fixed-rate unindexed track increased by 0.08 percentage points, and on the variable-rate unindexed track interest rates increased by 0.09 percentage points. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) declined by 0.3 percent in October, following an increase of 0.1 percent in September. Home prices increasedby 1.3 percent in August-September, following an increase of 0.6 percent in July-August. Over the 12 months ending in September, homeprices increased by 8.5 percent, compared with an increase of 7.1 percent in the 12 months ending in August. The number of transactions declined markedly in September, with only about 5,400 transactions carried out, apparently against a seasonal background, compared with an average of 7,700 transactions per month over the past 12 months. The most recent data on home prices and number of transactions were based on a low reported number of transactions, due to the holidays. New home sales declined slightly in September, to about 2,125 (seasonally adjusted), and the stock of new homes available for sale declined slightly from the record high it reached in August, to about 29,700 in September. The global economy: The global economy continues to grow at a moderate pace and world trade remains weak, but investment houses raised their growth forecasts slightly and purchasing managersindices worldwide also indicate a trend of improvement. Major central banks continue to conduct very accommodative monetary policy, and no further policy measures were taken this month. Inflation in most advanced economies remains relatively low, though it continues a gradual upward trend mainly against the background of the stabilization of energy and commodity prices. In the US, inflation is nearing the Federal Reserve's price stability target. The results of the elections held this month in the US led to a sharp increase in bond yields and significant strengthening of the dollar around the world, and to an increase in the probability of changes in US fiscal policy. These led to a sharp increase in inflation expectations. According to market assessments, there is a high probability that the federal funds rate will be raised by 0.25 percentage points in December, but the pace of increases thereafter is expected to be slow. GDP increased by 2.9 percentin the third quarter, a greater increase than expected, and according to forecasts, growth in the fourth quarter is also expected to be high. Personal consumption expenditure continues to support growth, while weakness in the manufacturing sector is moderating. Assessments are that the labor marketis nearing full employment. Data that became available in Europe continue to indicate a moderate growth rate, as the eurozone economy grew at a quarterly rate of 0.3 percent. The political uncertainty in the eurozone remainshigh, inter alia in view of the referendum expected to take place in Italynext month. Inflation in the eurozone remains low, and supports the assessment that the ECB will announce an expansion of its asset purchase program at its next meeting in early December. Deflationary pressures continued to weigh on the economy in Japan; GDP grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, as a result of an increase in exports. In most emerging economies, there were increases in bond yields, declines in stock prices and depreciation against the US dollar, against the background of the results of the US elections and the assessment that the US may adopt a policy that will include increased tariffs and a negative impact on trade agreements. In China, economic data published this month indicated stabilization in the pace of activity. The rate of growth in investments continued to recover. The Producer Price Index (PPI) in China continued to increase in October, and its continued upward trend is expected to contribute to a reduction in global deflationary pressures. The price of a barrel of Brent Sea crude oil declined slightlyduring the month, to $47. The index of commodities excluding energy increased by about 3 percent. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for December 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target range of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The Monetary Committee continues to assess that in view of the inflation environment, and of developments in the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time. Following are the main considerations underlying the decision: C 2B 7 The CPI for October increased by 0.2 percent. While inflation as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months remains negative, an increase in the annual inflation rate has been apparent for several months,as the effects of the decline in energy prices and of initiated price reductions abate. Short-term inflation expectations remained stable this month,below the lower bound of the target range. Medium-term and long-term expectations increased this month, mostly after the results of the US election became known, and were affected by the increase in inflation expectations worldwide. C 2B 7 The picture of real economic activity remains positive. Based onthe first estimate of third quarter National Accounts data. GDP increased by 3.2 percent, driven by investment and private consumption, while goods exports declined. The positive data, including revisions to previous figures, are consistent with the picture conveyed for some time by the labor market, of a continued increase in wages and employment. C 2B 7 To date, global financial markets' responses to the US election results have been seen mostly in increased government bond yields and in the strengthening of the dollar worldwide. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the changes that will occur in US economic policy in the medium term and their effect on Israel's economy. The global economy continues to grow at a slow pace, with a decline in the growth rate of world trade. Political developments in some advanced economies could weigh further on the growth of trade. Central banks continue their very accommodative monetary policy. Market assessments are that the probability of a 0.25 percentage point increase in the US federal funds rate in December is very high, and there was an increase in the interest rate path, though the pace of increases is still expected to be slow. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on October 26, 2016, through November 25, 2016, the shekel weakened by 0.8 percent against the dollar, and appreciated by 1.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The shekel has appreciated by 3.0 percent over the past 12 months in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The level of the effective exchange rate continues to weigh on the growth of exports and of the tradable sector. C 2B 7 While home prices continue to rise, the stock of unsold new homes remains high, and some slowdown is apparent in monthly mortgage volume, with a continued increase in mortgage interest rates. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to achieving the inflation target remain high. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment andgrowth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in thisregard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for December 2016 will be published on December 12, 2016. The decision regarding the interest rate for January 2017 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. December 26, 2016. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for December 2016 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target range of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. Following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. C 2B 7 The CPI for October increased by 0.2 percent."
Brazil,2016-11-30,"The Copom released the following note to the public&#58. The Copom released the following note to the public:. ""203rd Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (=9CCopom=9D) of the Central Bank of Brazil Press Release*. The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate to 13.75 percent per year, without bias. The following observations provide an update of the Copoms baseline scenario:. The set of indicators released since the last Copom meeting suggests weaker-than-expected economic activity in the short run. This led to downward revisions in forecasts for GDP growth in 2016 and 2017. Available evidence indicates that the economic recovery may be further delayed, and be more gradual than previously anticipated. The global outlook is particularly uncertain. The increase in asset price volatility indicates a possible end to the benign environment for emerging economies. There is a high probability that the process of normalization of the stance of monetary policy in the United States will soon resume, and the course of its economic policy is uncertain. Recent inflation releases were more favorable than expected, partly due to a drop in food prices, but also with signs of more widespread disinflation. Inflation expectations for 2017 collected by the Focus survey fell to around 4.9%. Expectations for 2018 and longer horizons remained around 4.5%. The Committees inflation forecasts fluctuated around the previous levels due to factors with opposing effects. Forecasts for 2016 in the reference and market scenarios fell to around 6.6%. Forecasts for 2017 in the reference and market scenarios show inflation around 4.4% and 4.7%, respectively. Forecasts for 2018 inflation in the reference and market scenarios are around 3.6% and 4.6%, respectively; and. The steps toward approval of fiscal reforms have been positive so far. The Committee identifies the following risks to the baseline scenario for inflation:. On the one hand, the possible end to the benign environment for emerging economies might make disinflation more difficult; signs of pause in the process of disinflation of some IPCA components that are most sensitive to monetary policy and economic slack persist, what may point to slower convergence of inflation to target; the process of approval and implementation of the necessary reforms and adjustments in the economy is lengthy, and carries uncertainty. On the other hand, weaker economic activity and a high level of economic slack may produce disinflation at a faster pace than the one embedded in the Copoms conditional forecasts; short-run inflation behavior has been more favorable, which may signal lower inflation persistence; and the process of approval and implementation of the necessary reforms and adjustments in the economy may be faster than anticipated. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the current balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate to 13.75 percent per year, without bias. The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the 4.5% target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2017 and 2018, is compatible with a gradual easing of monetary conditions. The magnitude of monetary easing and a possible speeding up of its pace will depend on inflation forecasts and expectations, and on the evolution of the aforementioned risk factors. In that respect, the Copom emphasizes that the pace of disinflation in its forecasts might intensify if the economic recovery is delayed further, and occurs more gradually than anticipated. This intensification of the disinflation process relies on an adequate global environment. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor).

India,2016-12-07,"Fifth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2016-17 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.25 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with an accommodative stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving consumer price index (CPI) inflation at 5 per cent by Q4 of 2016-17 and the medium-term target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 2. Global growth picked up modestly in the second half of 2016, after weakening in the first half. Activity in advanced economies (AEs) improved hesitantly, led by a rebound in the US. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), growth has moderated, but policy stimulus in China and some easing of stress in the larger commodity exporters shored up momentum. World trade is beginning to emerge out of a trough that bottomed out in July-August and shows signs of stabilising. Inflation has ticked up in some AEs, though well below target, and is easing in several EMEs. Expectations of reflationary fiscal policies in the US. Japan and China, and the waning of downward pressures on EMEs in recession are tempered by still-prevalent political risks in the euro area and the UK, emerging geo-political risks and the spectre of financial market volatility. International financial markets were strongly impacted by the result of the US presidential election and incoming data that raised the probability of the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy. As bouts of volatility fuelled a risk-off surge into US equities and out of fixed income markets, a risk-on stampede pulled out capital flows from EMEs, plunging their currencies and equity markets to recent lows even as bond yields hardened in tandem with US yields. The surge of the US dollar from late October intensified after the election results and triggered sizable depreciations in currencies around the world. Commodity prices firmed up across the board from2 mid-November on an improvement in the outlook for demand following the US election results, barring gold which lost its safe haven glitter to the ascendant US dollar. Crude prices have firmed after the OPEC's decision to cut output. On the domestic front, the growth of real gross value added (GVA) in Q2 of 2016-17 turned out to be lower than projected on account of a deeper than expected slowdown in industrial activity. Manufacturing slowed down both sequentially and on an annual basis, with weak demand conditions and the firming up of input costs dragging down the profitability of corporations. Gross fixed capital formation contracted for the third consecutive quarter. Although government final consumption expenditure slowed sequentially, it supported private final consumption expenditure, the mainstay of aggregate demand. The contribution of net exports to aggregate demand remained positive, but on account of a sharper contraction in imports relative to exports. Turning to Q3, the Committee felt that the assessment is clouded by the still unfolding effects of the withdrawal of specified bank notes (SBNs). The steady expansion in acreage under rabi sowing across major crops compared to a year ago should build on the robust performance of agriculture in Q2. By contrast, industrial activity remains weak. Among the core industries in the index of industrial production (IIP), the output of coal contracted in October due to subdued demand, while the production of crude oil and natural gas shrank under the binding constraint of structural impediments. The production of cement, fertilisers and electricity continued to decelerate, reflecting the sluggishness in underlying economic activity. On the other hand, steel output has recorded sustained expansion following the application of countervailing duties. Refinery output accelerated on the back of a pick-up in exports and capacity additions. The withdrawal of SBNs could transiently interrupt some part of industrial activity in November-December due to delays in payments of wages and purchases of inputs, although a fuller assessment is awaited. In the services sector, the outlook is mixed with construction, trade, transport, hotels and communication impacted by temporary SBN effects, while public administration, defence and other services would continue to be buoyed by the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) award and one rank one pension (OROP). GVA by financial services is expected to receive a short-term boost from the large inflow of low-cost deposits. Retail inflation measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) eased more than expected for the third consecutive month in October, driven down by a sharper than anticipated deflation in the prices of vegetables. Underlying this softer reading, however, was an upturn in momentum as prices rose month-on-month across the board. Still elevated prices of sugar and protein-rich items, coupled with a turning up of prices of cereals, pulses and processed foods pushed up the momentum of food prices, which partly offset the moderation in food inflation brought about by a strong favourable base effect. In the fuel category, inflation eased with the decline in LPG prices on an annual basis and a fall in electricity prices from a month ago. Inflation excluding food and fuel continues to show strong persistence. Although housing and personal care inflation softened marginally, the steady rise in inflation in respect of education, medical and health services, and transport and communication has imparted stickiness to inflation in this category. Liquidity conditions have undergone large shifts in Q3 so far. Surplus conditions in October and early November were overwhelmed by the impact of the withdrawal of SBNs from November 9. Currency in circulation plunged by 7.4 trillion up to December 2; consequently, net of replacements, deposits surged into the3 banking system, leading to a massive increase in its excess reserves. The Reserve Bank scaled up its liquidity operations through variable rate reverse repo auctions of a wide range of tenors from overnight to 91 days, absorbing liquidity (net) of 5.2 trillion. The Reserve Bank allowed oil bonds issued by the Government as eligible securities under the LAF. From the fortnight beginning November 26, an incremental CRR of 100 per cent was applied on the increase in net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between September 16, 2016 and November 11, 2016 as a temporary measure to drain excess liquidity from the system. From November 28, liquidity absorption fell back and the Reserve Bank undertook variable rate repo auctions of 3.3 trillion on November 28. As expected, money market conditions tightened thereafter and the weighted average call rate (WACR) traded near the upper bound of the LAF corridor on that day before dropping back to the policy repo rate on November 30. All other rates in the system firmed up in sympathy, with term premia getting restored gradually. Through this episode, active liquidity management prevented the WACR from falling even to the fixed rate reverse repo rate, the lower bound of the LAF corridor. Liquidity management was bolstered by an increase in the limit on securities under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) from 0.3 trillion to 6 trillion on November 29. There have been three issuances of cash management bills under MSS for 1.4 trillion by December 6, 2016. In the external sector. India's merchandise exports rebounded in September and October. The return to positive territory was supported by a pick-up in both POL and non-POL exports. After a prolonged fall for 22 months, imports rose in October on the back of a sharp rise in the volume of gold imports and higher payments for POL imports. Non-oil non-gold import growth also turned positive after a gap of seven months. For the period April-October, the merchandise trade deficit was lower by US $ 25 billion from its level a year ago. Accordingly, the current account deficit is likely to remain muted, notwithstanding some loss of remittances and software exports under invisibles. Net foreign direct investment has remained reasonably robust, with more than half going to manufacturing, communication and financial services. By contrast, portfolio investment outflows of the order of US $ 7.3 billion occurred in October-November from both debt and equity markets – as in peer EMEs across the board – reflecting a strong home bias triggered by the outcome of the US presidential election and the near-certainty of monetary policy tightening in the US. The level of foreign exchange reserves was US$ 364 billion on December 2, 2016. Outlook 9. The Committee took note of the upturn in the prices of several items that is masked by the easing of inflation on base effects during October. Despite some supply disruptions, the abrupt compression of demand in November due to the withdrawal of SBNs could push down the prices of perishables in the reading that becomes available in December. On the other hand, prices of wheat, gram and sugar have been firming up. While discretionary spending on goods and services in the CPI excluding food and fuel – constituting 16 per cent of the CPI basket – could have been affected by restricted access to cash, the prices of these items may weather these transitory effects as they are normally revised according to pre-set cycles. Prices of housing, fuel and light, health, transport and communication, pan, tobacco and intoxicants, and education – together accounting for 38 per cent of the CPI basket – may remain largely unaffected. Going forward, base effects are expected to reverse and turn unfavourable in December and February. If the usual winter moderation in food prices does not materialise due to the disruptions, food inflation pressures could re-emerge. Furthermore. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has4 been resistant to downward impulses and could set a floor to headline inflation. With the OPEC's agreement to cut production, crude prices may firm up in the coming months. Global developments, especially as financial markets factor in the future stance of US monetary and fiscal policy, could impart volatility to the exchange rate thereby feeding into inflation. The withdrawal of SBNs could result in a possible temporary reduction in inflation of the order of 10-15 basis points in Q3. Taking these factors into account, headline inflation is projected at 5 per cent in Q4 of 2016-17 with risks tilted to the upside but lower than in the October policy review. The fuller effects of the house rent allowances under the 7th CPC award are yet to be assessed, pending implementation, and have not been reckoned in this baseline inflation path (Chart 1). The outlook for GVA growth for 2016-17 has turned uncertain after the unexpected loss of momentum by 50 basis points in Q2 and the effects of the withdrawal of SBNs which are still playing out. Downside risks in the near term could travel through two major channels: (a) short-run disruptions in economic activity in cash-intensive sectors such as retail trade, hotels & restaurants and transportation, and in the unorganised sector; (b) aggregate demand compression associated with adverse wealth effects. The impact of the first channel should, however, ebb with the progressive increase in the circulation of new currency notes and greater usage of non-cash based payment instruments in the economy, while the impact of the second channel is likely to be limited. In October 2016. GVA growth in H2 was projected at 7.7 per cent and for the full year at 7.6 per cent. Incorporating the expected loss of growth momentum in Q3 and waning effects in Q4 alongside the boost to consumption demand from higher agricultural output and the implementation of the 7th CPC award. GVA growth for 2016-17 is revised down from 7.6 per cent to 7.1 per cent, with evenly balanced risks (Chart 2). The liquidity management framework was refined in April with the objective of meeting short-term liquidity needs through regular facilities, frictional and seasonal mismatches through fine-tuning operations and more durable liquidity needs for facilitating growth by modulating net foreign assets and net domestic assets. The Reserve Bank has conducted liquidity management consistent with this framework, progressively moving the system level ex ante liquidity conditions to close to neutrality. In Q3 up to early November, liquidity conditions remained in mild surplus mode. The Reserve Bank injected liquidity of 1.1 trillion through OMO purchases5 during the fiscal year so far, including an OMO purchase auction of 100 billion in October. Although the replacement of SBNs has engendered large surplus liquidity warranting exceptional operations, this needs to be seen as transitory. The Reserve Bank is committed to conducting liquidity operations in pursuit of the objectives of the revised framework put in place in April to restore system level liquidity to a position of neutrality as the surplus liquidity pressures abate. In the view of the Committee, this bi-monthly review is set against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty. Globally, the imminent tightening of monetary policy in the US is triggering bouts of high volatility in financial markets, with the possibility of large spillovers that could have macroeconomic implications for EMEs. In India, while supply disruptions in the backwash of currency replacement may drag down growth this year, it is important to analyse more information and experience before judging their full effects and their persistence – short-term developments that influence the outlook disproportionately warrant caution with respect to setting the monetary policy stance. If the impact is transient as widely expected, growth should rebound strongly. Turning to inflation, food prices other than vegetables are exhibiting sustained firmness and a pick-up in momentum. Another disconcerting feature of recent developments is the downward inflexibility in inflation excluding food and fuel which could set a resistance level for future downward movements in the headline. Moreover, volatility in crude prices and the surge in financial market turbulence could put the inflation target for Q4 of 2016-17 at some risk. Given these indicators of underlying inflation, it is appropriate to look through the transitory but unclear effects of the withdrawal of SBNs while setting the monetary policy stance. On balance, therefore, it is prudent to wait and watch how these factors play out and impinge upon the outlook. Accordingly, the policy repo rate has been kept on hold in this review, while retaining an accommodative policy stance. Six members voted in favour of the monetary policy decision. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published on December 21, 2016. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on February 7 & 8, 2017 and its resolution will be placed on the Reserve Bank's website on February 8, 2017.

Poland,2016-12-07,"Warsaw, 7 December 2016 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 6-7 December 2016 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 1.50%;  lombard rate at 2.50%;  deposit rate at 0.50%;  rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic growth remains moderate with uncertainty about its outlook. In the euro area economic growth has been stable, yet in 2016 Q3 it eased in several member states, including Germany. GDP growth has decelerated also in the Central and Eastern European economies. In the United States, economic conditions have been favourable, while in China economic growth has been lower than in previous years. In Russia, recession has been receding. Amid moderate global economic growth and lower commodity prices than in previous years, price growth in the environment of the Polish economy has still been very low, albeit increasing. The European Central Bank has kept the interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and has continued financial asset purchases. The Federal Reserve indicates a likely rise in the interest rates in the near future. As a result of the prospective monetary policy tightening in the United States, the US dollar has appreciated and bond yields have risen in many countries. In addition, the emerging market currencies, including the zloty, have depreciated. In Poland. GDP growth decelerated in 2016 Q3 and remained subdued also in the current quarter as signalled by recent economic data. The slowdown has been caused mainly by a fall in investment related to temporarily lower absorption of EU funds after expiration of the previous EU financial framework. Investment has been additionally contained by uncertainty among enterprises. Lower GDP growth in 2016 Q3 resulted also from weaker increase in exports compared to the previous quarter, most probably stemming from slower economic growth in the major trading partners. Poland's economic growth has been supported, in turn, by increasingly faster rise in consumer demand amid ongoing improvement in the labour market, favourable household sentiment and the child benefit payments under the ”Family 500 plus” programme. Annual growth in prices of consumer goods and services has been gradually rising  in November it was 0%. Also producer price growth has been accelerating at a moderate pace. The increase in price growth has resulted mainly from the dissipating effects of the earlier sharp fall in global commodity prices. Price growth has been contained by low 1/2 inflation abroad, negative output gap in the domestic economy and low inflation expectations. In the Council's opinion, price growth will continue to gradually increase. Besides waned effects of the earlier falls in commodity prices, price growth will be driven by an expected acceleration in GDP growth following its temporary easing in 2016. GDP growth will be supported by faster rise in consumer demand. In addition, the investment growth rate should pick up in 2017, supported by good financial standing of enterprises and their high capacity utilisation, as well as a gradual increase in the absorption of EU funds. The Council confirms its assessment that  given the available data and forecasts  the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance."
Ukraine,2016-12-08,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to leave the discount rate unchanged at 14% per annum. This decision was prompted by the need to mitigate inflation risks to enable the NBU to meet the inflation targets for 2017-2018. In October 2016, annual headline inflation stood at 12.4%, which was broadly in line with the NBU forecast. The acceleration of headline inflation was mainly attributed to upward adjustments in administered prices and base effects. At the same time, the fundamental factors did not exert any inflationary pressure. In October, core inflation remained flat compared to previous month, standing at 6.5% y-o-y. Inflation remained on the projected path, reflecting moderate consumer demand, a high supply of food products due to a high harvest, and prudent monetary policy. In November 2016, according to the NBU estimates, inflation moderated slightly in line with the projected disinflation path. The further slowdown in annual core inflation contributed to the deceleration of inflation. In addition, price increases for unprocessed foods were moderate due to a higher supply of these food products. Moderate price increases for unprocessed foods offset inflationary pressure from higher fuel prices driven largely by global price developments and the reflection of upward adjustments in administered prices in price statistics. At the same time, the impact of higher hryvnia exchange rate volatility on inflation was limited in November. The impact of fundamental factors, including a more favorable external price environment for Ukrainian exporters and strong grain exports, was partially offset by heightened political tensions. However, the overall supply of foreign currency in the interbank market exceeded the demand for it. As a result, the NBU mainly purchased foreign currency to replenish international reserves. Headline inflation is bound to reach the target level of 12% by the end of the year. Also, the inflation targets for 2017 and 2018 (8%+/-2 pp and 6%+/-2 pp respectively) remain within reach. However, risks for further inflation developments have increased since the previous monetary policy meeting, prompting the NBU to adopt a cautious approach to easing monetary policy to meet the declared targets. First, the NBU has taken into account the need to buffer the effects from a sharp rise in the minimum wage in 2017. According to the NBU's estimates, the government's initiative to raise the minimum wage will have a limited impact on inflation. However, higher households' income will fuel consumption growth, which could add an additional 1 percentage point to headline inflation. Accordingly, to buffer the effects from a rise in the minimum wage, the NBU has decided to pursue a more restrained monetary policy. Also, the NBU has taken into account other risks. First, uncertainty has increased due to heightened political tensions. Second, there is a high probability that there will be further delays in disbursements of official financing due to the slow pace of implementation of program measures. Should the risks for price stability abate, the NBU will continue easing monetary policy next year as this move will help reduce borrowing costs and support economic growth. The decision to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 14% is approved by NBU Board Decision No. 475-рш, dated 8 December 2016. On the Key Policy Rate. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 26 January 2017 according to the schedule approved and published on the NBU's website."
Chile,2016-12-13,"Santiago. Chile. Tuesday, 13 December 2016 Monetary Policy Meeting  December 2016 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3.5%. Internationally, long-term interest rates continued to rise in the developed world. Regarding commodities, it is worth noting the increase in the oil price and the persistence of the copper price above its mid-year levels. Activity figures are yet to improve. There outlook is not changing significantly in part because there is no clarity about the effects of potential changes in the economic policies of developed countries yet. In November, the monthly CPI variation was in line with forecasts, posting an annual variation of 2.9%. Inflation expectations at the end of the projection horizon are near target, although for the coming months they will remain in the lower part of the tolerance range. Provisional data for the fourth-quarter reveal a weak performance particularly in mining and some manufacturing lines. At the same time, demand data points to growth rates similar to recent quarters. The labor market continues to adjust at a gradual pace. Long-term interest rates have undone part of their previous increases and the peso has appreciated. The Board estimates that, if the recent trends of the economic scenario persist, and so do their implications on the medium-term inflation outlook, it will be necessary to boost the monetary impulse. At the same time, it reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. The Spanish original prevails."
Thailand,2016-12-13,"1 - Summary Conclusion of the Joint Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 9 December 2016 The Bank of Thailand announced the summary conclusion of the joint meeting of the MPC and the FIPC on 9 December 2016 to assess the risks to Thailand's financial stability as follows. Thailand's overall financial stability remains sound. This was reflected in high capital buffers maintained by financial institutions and insurance companies; the resilience of the Thai capital market amid recent major events; large corporates' strong balance sheets; as well as the strong external financial position with continued current account surplus and high level of international reserves. These positive factors had enabled Thailand's financial system to weather through volatilities from domestic and global macro-financial conditions quite well. Nonetheless the loan quality continued to deteriorate, especially for highly indebted households and some segments of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In addition, the demand for housing subsided in line with the overall economic conditions, while there was oversupply in certain areas. The search-for-yield behavior continues to gain traction. Deposit-like mutual funds and unrated bond issuances continued to grow; at the same time, institutional investors also invested in riskier assets to generate higher returns expected by customers. These developments, altogether, could potentially lead to the underpricing of risks by some investors. In this regard, the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken steps to enhance some related regulations, including those on financial product offering and information disclosure to investors. Moreover savings cooperatives became another venue for the search-for-yield behavior, as indicated by an upward trend in deposits and shares mobilized from cooperatives' members. This calls for enhancements in the legislative and supervisory framework to ensure prudent risk management and to align with the underlying philosophy of cooperatives. In the periods ahead. Thailand's financial system still faces several risks. The uncertainty surrounding the global growth trajectory remains, while the ongoing domestic recovery is still gradual and uneven across sectors. These could weigh on some households and corporates' ability to service debts, which could add to vulnerabilities going forward. Meanwhile global financial markets and capital flows are expected to become more volatile. The key risk to monitor is the potential impact of a bond yield increase, which could be faster than expected (yield snapback), on businesses' funding costs and rollover risks, especially for businesses that finance through short- term loans and corporate bonds. All the related regulators, including the Bank of Thailand, the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Office of Insurance Commission have jointly assessed and monitored the risks regularly and continued to enhance and enforce regulations to cope with the emerging risks appropriately. These efforts are aimed at preventing the build-up of vulnerabilities that could potentially affect the overall financial stability. Furthermore the three regulators have also agreed on common stress scenarios, which will be used to assess the strength of financial institutions under each regulator's supervision. This is to ensure that stress tests are conducted in a more consistent and integrated manner at the system-wide level."
Georgia,2016-12-14,"14.12.2016 The National Bank of Georgia keeps its monetary policy rate unchanged at 6.5%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on 14th of December 2016 and made a decision to keep refinancing rate unchanged at 6.5%. The decision is made following the macroeconomic forecast, according to which, in the medium term the factors affecting inflation from the demand side will be weak. However, transmission of external shocks recently and expected increase in excise tax will have one time effect on prices. But if inflation expectations are contained this will have only temporary effect on inflation rate. Taking this into account National Bank of Georgia considers keeping the rate unchanged in the short run and will continue to monitor the development of inflationary expectations. Inflation rate is close to zero level for last several months and dropped 0.2% in November. The main reason behind low inflation is weak aggregate demand together with declining prices in previous periods for commodities on international markets. This year NBG started to gradually withdraw from tightened policy stance. As a result we observe interest rate decline on loans and increased lari lending, which is important factor for stimulation of demand. Recently, the transmission of external shocks on Georgia's economy has strengthened. The global appreciation of dollar together with the depreciation of Turkish Lira and Euro exchange rate has affected Gel exchange rate with dollar, through expectations and trade channels. On the other hand, the positive trends were observed in exporting sector. For the last few month exports of goods is increasing annually. The growth pattern is also maintained in tourism revenues and remittances. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on 25th of January 2017."
United States,2016-12-14,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace since mid-year. Job gains have been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate has declined. Household spending has been rising moderately but business fixed investment has remained soft. Inflation has increased since earlier this year but is still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up considerably but still are low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Stanley Fischer; Esther L George; Loretta J Mester; Jerome H Powell; Eric Rosengren; and Daniel K Tarullo. Implementation Note issued December 14, 2016."
South Korea,2016-12-15,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of steady economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that the Chinese economy has maintained its moderate pace of growth. The euro area has also continued its improvements. The Board forecasts that the global economy will maintain its moderate recovery going forward, while being affected by factors such as the directions of the new government's economic policies and the pace of monetary policy normalization in the US, the uncertainties related to Britain's exit from the European Union, and economic conditions in emerging market countries. Looking at the Korean economy, exports have shifted to an increase but the improvements in domestic demand activities have been weak. On the employment front, the employment-to-population ratio in November was higher than that in November of last year, as the number of persons employed increased. The unemployment rate meanwhile maintained the same level as in November last year. The Board forecasts that the domestic economy will sustain its trend of modest growth going forward, in line with a recovery of the global economy, but judges that the downside risks to the future growth path have expanded a bit, owing chiefly to the high degrees of uncertainty in recent domestic and external conditions. Consumer price inflation registered 1.3% in November, the same as in October despite the extent of decline in petroleum product prices having narrowed, as the pace of increase in prices of industrial products other than petroleum slowed. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell slightly to 1.4%, from 1.5% in October. In the housing market, sales and leasehold deposit prices have shown upward trends, centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will gradually rise, due mainly to the effects of the increases in international oil prices. In the domestic financial markets since November, influenced mainly by expectations concerning the new US government's economic policies and the monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve, long-term market interest rates and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate have risen. The Korean won-Japanese yen exchange rate has meanwhile fallen, in line with the yen's relative weakening. Stock prices have rebounded after having declined, owing in part to increases in global stock prices. The extent of growth in household lending has expanded, led by home mortgage loans. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor the uncertainties in domestic and external conditions and their effects, the progress of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, and the trend of increase in household debt."
Peru,2016-12-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR DECEMBER 2016 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is consistent with an inflation forecast in which inflation converges to 2 percent towards the end of 2017 and takes into account that: Expectations of inflation in 12 months have increased slightly, but continue showing a declining path within the target range in the next two years; The water deficit generated by adverse climate factors has been affecting inflation in transitory manner; Domestic economic activity is expected to grow at a rate close to its potential growth level in the following quarters, and The global economy shows signals of recovery and lower volatility in international financial markets. The Board oversees new data on inflation and inflation determinants in the forecast horizon to evaluate the convenience of making additional adjustments in the monetary policy rate. Inflation in November showed a rate of 0.29 percent due to rises in the prices of some food products and electricity rates, which has led the year-to-year rate of inflation to decline from 3.41 percent in October to 3.35 percent in November. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.15 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate remains at 3.00 percent. The indicators associated with construcion and manufacturing have fallen in recent months due to the weakness of investment. However, indicators of business expectations remain at high levels on the optimistic side. GDP is expected to grow 3.9 percent in 2016 and 4.2 percent in 2017. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Monetary Program for the following 12 months will be approved on the Board meetings to be held on the following dates: January 12 February 9 March 9 April 6 May 11 June 8 July 13 August 10 September 14 October 12 November 9 December 14 Moreover, in 2017 BCRP will publish its Inflation Reports on the following dates: March 24 June 16 September 15 December 15."
Colombia,2016-12-16,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 7.5%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In November, annual consumer inflation and the average of core inflation indicators lowered, reaching 5.96% and 5.74%, respectively, completing four consecutive months in which the reduction of inflation exceeded the forecast of the technical staff at the Central Bank. Analysts' inflation expectations to one and two years posted at 4.36% and 3.58%, respectively, and those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years are between 3.8% and 4.4%. The effects of the strong transitory supply shocks that diverted inflation from its target continue to fade quickly. This is suggested by the slowdown in the food CPI, and to a lesser extent, by the recent behavior of the prices that were mostly impacted in the past by the strong nominal depreciation. Global economic activity remains weak, and it is likely that it will register a slight recovery in 2017. In the US, gradual tightening of the monetary policy continued, the US dollar has strengthened, and the long-term international interest rates increased. Colombia=C2=B4s terms of trade continue recovering due to the increase in the prices of oil. In this setting, the recent depreciation of the peso has been moderate. In the third quarter, the Colombian economy expanded 1.2% yearly, a figure lower than expected by the technical staff at Banco de la Republica and by the market. Domestic demand fell 1.1% due to lower investment and the slowdown in consumption. These results and the new figures of economic activity for the fourth quarter suggest that economic growth in 2016 could be slightly lower than 2.0%. The new figures confirm that the current account deficit continues to reduce. The forecast of the technical staff suggests a current account deficit of 4.7% of GDP in 2016 (equivalent to US$ 13.2 billion). Considering the current level of core inflation indicators and inflation expectations, various calculations of the real policy interest rate are above its average since 2005. Also, credit has strongly slowed-down, especially commercial credit. In all, the Colombian economy continues to adjust to the strong shocks recorded since 2014, and the current account deficit is narrowing gradually. Inflation continues to decline faster than expected, although core inflation indicators and inflation expectations to a year still exceed the target. The effects of several of the transitory supply shocks that have affected inflation and inflation expectations continue to reverse, and this trend is expected to continue. Monetary policy decisions have ensured the process of convergence of inflation to its target and reaffirm the commitment of the Board to reach the 3.0% =C2=B1 1 pp target in 2017. In this environment, and facing a weaker-than-forecast output dynamics, the Board of Directors decided to reduce the degree of tightness of the monetary policy stance by reducing the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp. Future policy decisions will depend on new data on the speed of convergence of inflation to the target and the intensity, nature, and persistence of the economic slowdown, among other things. The Board considers that, given the negative effects of the fall in oil prices on public finances, the structural tax reform bill presented by the Government to the Congress is a crucial action that contributes to long-term growth, to strengthen fiscal sustainability, to maintain macroeconomic stability, and to preserve the credit rating. The Board will continue to monitor the adjustment of expenditures and its consistency with the long-term income level, the sustainability of the external deficit, and, in general, the macroeconomic stability. It also reaffirms its commitment to maintain inflation and its expectations anchored to the target. The decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate was approved by four members of the Board. The three remaining members of the Board voted to keep it unaltered."
Russia,2016-12-16,"On 16 December 2016, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 10.00% per annum. The Board of Directors notes that the dynamics of inflation and economic activity are overall in line with the forecast and inflation risks have subsided somewhat. Consumer price growth is slowing down in part under the influence of temporary factors, while reduction in inflation expectations remains unstable. Given this decision and considering that the moderately tight monetary policy is maintained, inflation will slow to the 4% target in late 2017. As the trend towards a sustainable decline in consumer price growth takes root, the Bank of Russia will consider an opportunity of cutting the key rate in the first half of 2017. When making its key rate decisions in the months ahead, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks alongside with the alignment of inflation dynamics and economic performance with the baseline forecast. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors proceeded from the following:. Inflation dynamics. Annual inflation continues to decline in line with the Bank of Russia's baseline forecast. However, this is partly due to temporary factors. According to estimates, as of 12 December 2016 annual price growth fell to 5.6% from 6.1% in October. Price growth has slowed down noticeably in all key groups of goods and services and monthly seasonally adjusted inflation indicators have declined as well. The ruble exchange rate dynamics continues to be conducive to inflation deceleration as oil prices have been higher than expected and Russian financial assets remain attractive to external investors. A good harvest still facilitates a reduction in food inflation. At the same time, a more confident drop in non-food price growth is necessary for sustainable inflation decline. Households prefer to stick to a savings behaviour model, however, the disinflationary impact of domestic demand is subsiding gradually. Annual growth in real wages may facilitate a gradual recovery of demand for goods and services. Consumer lending dynamics do not entail material inflation risks so far. Moderately tight monetary conditions need to be maintained in order to encourage households to save and set the trend towards sustainable inflation reduction under the impact of the demand-side constraints. This will enable a further decline in inflation expectations of both households and businesses. According to the Bank of Russia forecast, given the decision made annual inflation will slow to the 4% target in late 2017. Monetary conditions. Moderately tight monetary conditions are still conducive to inflation reduction. Positive real interest rates will be kept at the level which will ensure demand for loans without an intensification of inflationary pressure and will also preserve incentives for savings. The potential of interest rate reduction is limited in the near future. Economic activity. The economy is progressing towards recovery in line with the Bank of Russia's baseline forecast. The estimates show that quarter-on-quarter GDP was no longer in decline in Q3 and industrial production expanded in October—November. However, the rebound in economic activity is still heterogeneous among industries and regions. Import substitution is advancing together with certain non-commodity exports and new lines of industrial growth, including the high-tech development. Business activity in services is also on the rise. Positive trends will take time to evolve and take hold. By the end of 2016, the output of goods and services will decrease by 0.5-0.7% with a slight growth in quarterly GDP to be seen in Q4. We expect moderate economic growth of less than 1% in 2017 and an increase to 1.5-2% in 2018-2019. The labour market is adapting to the new economic conditions and unemployment remains persistently low. The forecast is based on conservative assumptions about sluggish global growth, year-average oil prices of $40 per barrel for the entire forecast horizon, moderate capital outflow and structural constraints in the Russian economy. Inflation risks. Risks that inflation fails to achieve the 4% target in 2017 have subsided somewhat. These risks stem largely from the inertia of inflation expectations and a decrease in household propensity to save. Price volatility in global commodity and financial markets may also have an adverse impact on exchange rate and inflation expectations. Approving of conservative budget consolidation strategy, including moderate indexation of wages and pensions in the medium-term horizon, makes an uncertainty and inflation risks from fiscal policy subside. At the same time, these risks might increase if government spending rise in higher oil price scenario. As the trend towards a sustainable decline in consumer price growth takes root, the Bank of Russia will consider an opportunity of cutting the key rate in the first half of 2017. When making its key rate decisions in the months ahead, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks alongside with the alignment of inflation dynamics and economic performance with the baseline forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 3 February 2017. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board's decision is to be published at 13.30 Moscow time. 1 Loans provided at a floating interest rate, linked to the Bank of Russia key rate.2 Starting from 01.07.2016 auctions were discontinued.3 Fine-tuning operations.4 Starting from 1 January 2016 the refinancing rate was set equal to the Bank of Russia key rate set as of the respective date.

Hungary,2016-12-20,"At its meeting on 20 December 2016, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 21 December 2016:. In the Council's assessment. Hungarian economic growth continues to pick up from the end of this year. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy, but looking ahead, the disinflationary impact of the domestic real economic environment is gradually dissipating. Inflation rises over the forecast period and reaches the inflation target in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose in November 2016, in line with the Bank's expectations. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation remained broadly unchanged. Looking ahead, whole-economy wage growth is likely to rise further, as a result of continued strong demand for labour and the latest wage agreement. This in turn is likely to raise core inflation through an increase in household consumption. However, with persistently low global inflation and historically low inflation expectations, the consumer price index is expected to rise only gradually. In the current projection, inflation reaches the 3 per cent level consistent with price stability in the first half of 2018. The Hungarian economy grew by 2.2 per cent in the third quarter of 2016 relative to the same period a year earlier. The strong expansion in household consumption was the main driving force behind growth. Retail sales rose further while industrial production fell in October relative to the same period of the previous year. Outstanding lending to small and medium-sized companies increased by around 7 per cent in the third quarter and the stock of corporate loans has also started to show signs of a turnaround. Outstanding loans in the household sector grew further. Private sector investment picked up and government investment, strongly linked to the use of EU funding, fell sharply. Labour demand remained strong, and therefore the number of employees increased and the unemployment rate fell further. Household consumption is expected to grow further as wage growth strengthens, which will be supported by the realisation of consumption deferred from previous years. Looking ahead. Hungary's current account surplus is likely to decrease, driven by rising domestic demand. The Council expects economic growth of over 3 per cent in the coming years, to which the Bank's and the Government's measures to stimulate economic growth contribute substantially. Sentiment in global financial markets has been mostly favourable since the Council's latest interest rate-setting decision. News from the oil market and expectations about the stability of the euro-area banking sector were the focus of attention. In December, the US Fed and the ECB made decisions in diverging policy directions. As expected, the Fed decided to raise interest rates and, looking ahead, moved towards a tighter policy path. By contrast, the ECB decided to extend its quantitative easing programme. As a result, euro-area monetary conditions, most relevant for Hungarian monetary policy, are expected to remain accommodative for a longer period. The majority of developed market equity indices rose while bond prices declined. Yields on government securities fell along the entire yield curve. Hungary's strong external financing capacity and the decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. Forward-looking domestic money market real interest rates are in negative territory and are declining even further as inflation rises. In the Council's assessment, a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. In the Council's assessment, the operation of the monetary policy toolkit, extended in the last half year, has been successful. The Council considers the limit on the three-month deposit stock and its potential future change an integral part of the instruments. The Bank aims to ease monetary conditions and provide a corresponding degree of support to the economy through a decline in money market rates. At its meeting in December, the Monetary Council set a HUF 750 billion upper limit on the stock of three-month central bank deposits as at the end of the first quarter of 2017. The Council expects that this decision, consistent with the gradual steps taken so far, will mean the crowding out of at least HUF 100-200 billion additional liquidity from the deposit facility. The Monetary Council aims to ensure that the limit imposed on the stock of three-month deposits exerts its expected easing effect efficiently. On the next occasion, a decision on its level as at end of the second quarter of 2017 will be made in March 2017. In the Council's assessment, some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy while inflation is rising gradually to the target. The disinflationary impact of the real economy is gradually dissipating over the policy horizon. If the assumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, maintaining the current level of the base rate for an extended period and the loosening of monetary conditions by the change in the monetary policy instruments are consistent with the medium-term achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank monitors developments in monetary conditions and markets. If subsequently warranted by the achievement of the inflation target, the Council will stand ready to ease monetary conditions further using unconventional, targeted instruments."
Mongolia,2016-12-20,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Lowering the policy interest rate Number: 2016/05 Effective date: 20 December 2016 At the Monetary Policy Committee meeting that was held on 19 December 2016, the Bank of Mongolia decided to cut its policy rate by 1 percentage point to 14.0 percent. The Bank of Mongolia's decision on August 2016 to raise the policy interest rate was effective in preventing further instability in the foreign exchange market, preserving international reserves and thus, maintaining financial stability. This change in policy stance is to accommodate expected lower inflation. The recent analysis indicates that inflation is expected to be below the target level next year, with demand-driven pressure on inflation remaining low. Moreover, this policy action is supported by recent improvements in export prices and fiscal policy. Higher commodity prices and expected stability of petrol prices in the domestic market is supporting Mongolia's terms of trade. The improved terms of trade is strengthening foreign exchange inflow, balance of payments and fiscal revenue. The recently approved medium term fiscal framework and the state budget for 2017, which promote fiscal discipline and sustainability of public debt over the medium and long term, is providing an additional easing room for monetary policy. As such, monetary policy is being accommodated in order to encourage private sector investment and support real sector activities. However, the effectiveness of this policy action and future stance of monetary policy would be highly dependent on Government policies to support foreign investment, future fiscal discipline, and foreign debt repayments. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Turkiye,2016-12-20,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 8.5 percent and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,. b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 8 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been kept at 10 percent. Recently released data indicate that the economic activity has decelerated in the third quarter, before posting a partial recovery for the final quarter. Demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports. With the supportive measures and incentives provided recently, the recovery in the economic activity is expected to continue at a moderate pace. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Exchange rate movements due to recently heightened global uncertainty and the increase in oil prices pose upside risks on the inflation outlook. Yet, the aggregate demand developments restrain these effects. Developments will be closely monitored in order to make a sound assessment regarding the net impact of these factors. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and the cautious monetary policy stance will be maintained. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Philippines,2016-12-21,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 3.0 percent. The corresponding interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment of inflation dynamics and the risks to the inflation outlook over the policy horizon. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that average inflation would likely settle below the target range of 3.0 percent ± 1 percentage point for 2016. However, inflation is seen to return gradually to a path consistent with the inflation target in 2017-2018 due to higher oil prices and strong domestic economic activity. The overall balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook also remains tilted to the upside, owing partly to the pending petitions for adjustments in electricity rates as well as the initial impact of the government's broad fiscal reform program. Increased uncertainty in global economic prospects, meanwhile, continues to pose a key downside risk to the inflation outlook. Nevertheless, inflation expectations remain broadly consistent with the inflation target over the policy horizon. The Monetary Board also stressed that domestic demand conditions are likely to stay firm, supported by solid private household spending, higher government expenditure, and adequate domestic liquidity. In addition, the Monetary Board has considered the potential impact of the ongoing monetary policy adjustment in the US on global financial market conditions. The Monetary Board also noted that maintaining monetary policy settings at this juncture will give the BSP more time to assess evolving economic developments and calibrate its policy tools as appropriate. With these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriate. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions to ensure price and financial stability conducive to sustained economic growth."
Thailand,2016-12-21,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 21 December 2016 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 21 December 2016 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would continue to expand at a pace close to the previous assessment, but downside risks increased. Inflation was still expected to slowly rise. Meanwhile monetary conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery. Hence the Committee decided to keep the policy rate on hold at this meeting. The Thai economy was projected to expand at a pace close to the previous assessment. Tourism was affected more than expected by recent measures to curb illegitimate tour operators, and private investment remained low. Nevertheless such negative impact on growth was offset by improvements seen in exports of goods due to recent consolidation of production location of certain products to Thailand. Moreover private consumption improved on the back of farm income and the government's short-term stimulus measures. Meanwhile public expenditure remained an important growth driver for the economy. Looking ahead, the Committee viewed that the Thai economy remained on a recovery path with the overall growth momentum largely unchanged from the previous meeting. However risks to growth tilted further to the downside due to Thailand's trading partners which might record weaker-than-expected growth, uncertainties in the direction of the US trade policies that would have significant implications for confidence and international trade, and the number of Chinese tourists that could turn out lower than projected. Meanwhile uncertainties pertaining to political developments in Europe as well as concerns over the European and Chinese financial sectors continued to warrant close monitoring. Headline inflation was projected to gradually rise and return to the target band within the first quarter of 2017, although the timing would depend largely on future development in oil and fresh food prices. Core inflation remained stable at low levels around the previous assessment. Meanwhile the public's medium-term inflation expectations remained close to the target. Overall monetary conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery with ample liquidity in the financial system and low real interest rates. Long-term bond yields increased but remained close to last year's averages. Over the recent period, the baht depreciated against the US dollar, though to a lesser extent compared with overall trading partner currencies which might not be as beneficial to the ongoing economic recovery as it could. In addition, financial stability remained sound and able to provide cushion against economic and financial volatilities on both domestic and external fronts. However there remained pockets of risks that warranted close monitoring such as the deterioration in loan quality of some business sectors and the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment. 2 The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would still be facing greater uncertainties going forward, particularly the fragile global economic recovery and uncertainties in the economic and monetary policy directions of major advanced economies that might induce greater capital flow and exchange rate volatility. The Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative, and stands ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to ensure that monetary conditions are conducive to the economic recovery, while ensuring financial stability."
Czech Republic,2016-12-22,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions. It confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna against the euro so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the CNB still stands ready to intervene automatically without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment is unchanged.. This decision is based on the message of the CNB's current forecast and on an assessment of newly available information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. The forecast assumes that the exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until mid-2017. Inflation is rising, but is still below the 2% target. According to the forecast, inflation will increase further and slightly exceed the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon. According to the current forecast, sustainable fulfilment of the target, which is a condition for a return to conventional monetary policy, will thus occur from mid-2017 onwards. A need to maintain expansionary monetary conditions to the current extent persists. The Bank Board therefore states again that the CNB will not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017 Q2. The Bank Board still considers it likely that the commitment will be discontinued in mid-2017. At the same time, the Bank Board stated again that any exchange rate appreciation following the discontinuation of the exchange rate commitment would be dampened, among other things, by hedging of exchange rate risk by exporters during the existence of the commitment, as well as by the closing of koruna positions by financial investors. In addition, the CNB will stand ready to intervene to mitigate potential exchange rate volatility. Annual headline inflation has gone up in recent months. In November, it returned to the lower half of the tolerance band around the CNB's target after three years. Consumer price inflation in November was higher than forecasted, mainly because of a stronger recovery in food price inflation. Adjusted inflation excluding fuels was also above the forecast. This indicator of core inflation reflects the effect of growth in the domestic economy and rising wage growth. The growth of the Czech economy slowed further in Q3. It was below the current forecast as a result of a lower contribution of net exports. By contrast, total investment declined less significantly than forecasted. On the other hand, the expectation of a marked decline in investment due to an only gradual start to the new programme period for EU funds is still materialising. Household consumption growth accelerated further in line with the forecast. This confirmed the CNB's view that its previous slowdown had been temporary. New information on economic developments abroad largely confirms the assumptions of the current forecast. Economic growth in the effective euro area will slow slightly below 2% next year. The drop in foreign industrial producer prices is fading somewhat faster than forecasted. They are expected to return to growth at the start of next year. Consumer price inflation in the euro area will also start to increase. This will be fostered, among other things, by continued easy monetary policy of the ECB, which extended its quantitative easing programme until the end of next year but at the same time lowered its monthly volume. This is reflected in an outlook for slightly negative three-month EURIBOR rates over the entire forecast horizon. The market outlook expects the Brent crude oil price to stay close to its current elevated levels over the next two years. The outlook is thus little changed compared to the assumptions of the forecast. By contrast, the outlook for the euro-dollar exchange rate has weakened. This is due to the different directions of the monetary policies of the ECB and the Fed. The continuing domestic economic growth is manifesting itself in gradually increasing tensions on the labour market. Employment is rising further. This is reflected in a further decline in the unemployment rate, which is the lowest among the EU countries. Following a moderate slowdown, wage growth in the business sector accelerated again in Q3. Indicators from the real economy are sending out a mixed message at the end of this year. Industrial production growth slowed considerably, mainly reflecting an unexpected downturn in exports in October. The long-running decline in construction output, caused mainly by a drop in public investment, slowed only marginally in October. Retail sales growth remains at solid levels. The year-on-year price decline in manufacturing has moderated in recent months. Agricultural producer prices are still falling. Construction work prices continue to rise at a moderate pace and prices of market services are broadly stable in year-on-year terms. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy. GDP growth was lower than forecasted in 2016 Q3. By contrast, inflation and average wage growth were above the forecast. Unemployment was slightly lower than forecasted."
Israel,2016-12-26,"Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index for November declined by 0.4 percent, more than forecasters' predictions of a 0.1 percent decline, on average. The decline is partly explained by a seasonal decline in the fruit and vegetables component of 4.3 percent, which was large compared with the decline in recent years, and a seasonal increase of 1.5 percent in the clothing and footwear component that was low compared with the increase in recent years. The inflation rate as measured by the change in the CPI over the past 12 months was -0.3 percent,similar to the figure for last month. The effects of energy prices and administrative price reductions, which acted toward a decline in the CPI in the past two years, are dissipating: the change in the CPI in the past 12 months net of those effects is only slightly higher than the change in the general CPI. Over the past 12 months, prices of tradable goods in the CPI declined by 1.7 percent, and the prices of nontradable items increased by 0.4 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: One-year term inflation expectations were impacted by the surprise in the CPI for November. Inflation expectations derived from the capital market increased slightly, to 0.6 percent, and the average of private forecasters' projections declined slightly to 0.6 percent. Expectations for inflation derived from banks' internal interest rates increased slightly, after half a year of stability, to 0.4 percent. Forward expectations for medium and long terms fluctuated as well: they increased following the US elections and declined after the publication of the November CPI. Third-year forward expectations are 1.1 percent, compared with 1.4 percent prior to the previous monetary policy discussion, and 3-5 year forward expectations are 1.4 percent, compared with 1.5 percent prior to the previous monetary policy discussion. Longer-term forward expectations (5 to 10 years) were unchanged at 2.4 percent. Based on the makam curve, the Telbor curve and forecasters' assessments, there is a high probability of a rise in the Bank of Israel interest rate to 0.25 percent in about a year. Real economic activity: The picture of real economic activity remains positive, and various indicators point to a stable rate of growth. Foreign trade trend data indicate growth in imports, and contraction of exports due to a temporary slowdown in exports of electronic components. Goods exports excluding electronic components reached $3.5 billion in November (seasonally adjusted), and are high relative to their level in the recent period. Although total imports of consumer goods declined by 4.1 percent in September-November, led by a decline in durable goods imports (mainly transport vehicles), imports of current consumption goods increased by 10.1 percent and capital goods imports increased by 4.1 percent. The Composite State of the Economy Index continues to indicate a high rate of growth of activity, increasing by 0.3 percent in November, led by the index of goods exports. Preliminary data from the Companies Survey for the fourth quarter also indicate that business sector product continued to grow by a rate similar to that of previous quarters. The Purchasing Managers Index and Consumer Confidence Indices compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics and by Bank Hapoalim increased in November, with the latter at a six-year high. The labor market: The picture conveyed by the labor market remains very positive. Labor Force Survey data indicate that despite a slight decline in November, the prime working ages (25-64) continue to show a high labor force participation rate (79.8 percent, compared with 80.1 percent in October) and employment rate (76.6 percent, compared with 76.9 percent), and a low unemployment rate (3.9 percent, unchanged from October), while the job vacancy rate remains high, at 3.8 percent (seasonally adjusted). Health tax receipts for September-November were 6.3 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period in the year before. Budget data: The government was late in publishing data on tax revenues and the deficit for November. A preliminary analysis of the data indicates that the deficit in November, after adjusting for postponements of tax refunds that month due to labor sanctions at the Israel Tax Authority, was about NIS 400 million smaller than that in the seasonal path consistent with achieving the deficit target. The low deficitin November reflects expenditures lower than the path. Tax revenues (after the adjustment) were lower than the seasonal path, but these were offset by National Insurance Institute surpluses. Staff forecast: This month, the Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast. The notice of the forecast is being published in parallel with this release. Compared with the previous quarterly forecast, the current forecast incorporates a similar assessment regarding the development of inflation and the interest rate, and a more positive assessment regarding growth for 2016: the inflation rate is expected to be 1.0 percent over the coming four quarters (similar to the previous forecast), so that it is expected to return to within the target range in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Bank of Israel interest rate is expected, according tothe staff forecast, to remain at 0.1 percent during the coming period, to increase to 0.25 percent during the fourth quarter of 2017, and to increase to 0.5 percent in the second half of 2018. GDP is expected to grow by 3.5 percent in 2016 (compared with 2.8 percent in the previous forecast) because growth data for the first half were revised upward and growth in the third quarter was higher than expected. GDP is expected to grow by 3.2 percent in 2017 (compared with 3.1 percent in the previous forecast), and by 3.1 percent in 2018. Theforecast development of GDP reflects a gradual transition to growth based less on domestic uses and more on exports. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on November 27, 2016, through December 23, 2016, the shekel strengthened by 1.3 percent against the dollar, and appreciated by 2.0 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the preceding 12 months, the shekel appreciated by 5.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on November 27, 2016, through December 22, 2016, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 0.4 percent. In the government bond market, there were slight declines of up to 7 basis points in yields along the unindexed curve, and a slight steepening of the CPI-indexed bonds curve. The makam curve traded at a yield above the Bankof Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, decreased to about 69 basis points. The money supply: In the 12 months ending in November, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 18.1 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 7.9 percent. The credit market: In the third quarter, business sector debt increased by about NIS 10.5 billion (1.3 percent) to around NIS 841 billion. The increase derived mostly from a quantitative increase of about NIS 14.8 billion in nonbank debt, mainly through tradable bonds in Israel. In November, the business sector (excluding banks, insurance companies and foreign companies) issued NIS 3.3 billion in bonds, about half by the investment and holding company industry. The average monthly issuance for the year to date is about NIS 3.5 billion. Corporate bond spreads (excluding banks and insurance companies) decreased slightly at the beginning of December, to 2.93 percentage points, on average, continuing a decline in previous months. The balance of household debt increased in the third quarter by about NIS 11 billion, to total NIS 501 billion (an increase of 2.2 percent); about NIS 6 billion of the increase is in housing debt, which has a total balance of NIS 337 billion (an increase of about 1.8 percent). In November, the total volume of new mortgages taken out was NIS 4.7 billion. Over the past year, there has been a moderate downward trend in monthly mortgage volume. The average interest rate on mortgages continued to increase in November on all tracks. On the CPI-indexed, fixed-rate track, the rate increased by 0.06 percentage points, and on the CPI-indexed, variable-rate track, the rate increased by 0.04 percentage points. The interest rate on the unindexed fixed-rate track increased by 0.05 percentage points, and on the unindexed variable-rate track the interest rate increased by 0.09 percentage points. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) declined by 0.1 percent in November, following a decline of 0.3 percent in October. Home prices increased by 0.9 percent in September-October, following a similar increase in August-September. Over the 12 months ending in October, home prices increased by 8.7 percent,compared with an increase of 8.4 percent in the 12 months ending in September. The number of home transactions declined markedly in October, with only about 3,725 transactions carried out, but this was impacted on by the small number of business days due to the Jewish holidays in the month. New home sales increased slightly in October, to about 2,344 (seasonally adjusted), and the stock of new homes available for sale continued to increase, to about 30,300 (seasonally adjusted). In the third quarter, there were 13,000 building starts (seasonally adjusted), and in the past four quarters construction began on about 51,100 homes (seasonally adjusted). With that, the pace of building completions is slower, and in the same period only about 41,700 homes were completed. It should be noted thatthe initial publication of building starts data is generally biased to the downside, and the data tend to be revised upward subsequently. The global economy: Data that became available on the global economy indicate some improvement in the rate of growth, but it remains moderate. The OECD revised its 2017 global growth forecast slightly upward, to 3.3 percent from 3.2 percent, in light of the assessments that the new US administration will adopt expansionary fiscal policy. However, the forecast for world trade growth was revised downward, to 2.9 percent from 3.2 percent, and the institution noted the concern of increased barriers to world trade. Producer price indices in major economies, primarily China, are increasing and will support a rise in inflation worldwide. In the US, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds target rate. Based on the median path seen by Federal Open Market Committee members, three additional increases are expected in 2017; based on market assessments, the pace will be slightly more moderate but still higher than expected previously. In the labor market, growth in nonfarm payrolls and the decline in unemployment continued in November, with the unemployment rate reaching 4.6 percent, below the Federal Reserve's long term forecast, but the annual increase in salaries declined to 2.5 percent, compared with 2.8 percent in October. Personal consumption expenditure continues to drive the economy, and data from the real estate market were positive, but weakness in industrial production continues. Core inflation indices are near the target of 2 percent. In Europe, the moderate growth continues, and the ECB forecasts that growth in the coming three years will be 1.6-1.7 percent. The economy is exposed to political risks and to the undermining of banking system stability. These risks increased this month with the resignation of the government in Italy and the strengthening of tensions related to the program of assistance to Greece. Unemployment declined to 9.8 percent, the lowest level since 2009, and private consumption is driving the economy. The ECB reduced the scope of monthly purchases of bonds but extended the program until December 2017, a step seen overall as expansionary. The inflation rate is increasing moderately, as the impact of the decline in energy prices dissipates, but it is still markedly lower than the target. In Japan, accommodative policy remained in place, and macro data indicated some improvement in activity. In various emerging market economies as well therewas some improvement in activity, against the background of stability in commodity prices and strengthening of demand from China, but this improvement comes after long weakness. The weakness in world trade and the process of raising interest rates in the US place the recovery in some emerging economies at risk. In China, positive data on activity were reported, and there was a moderate increase in inflation. The price of a barrel of Brent crude increased this month by more than 10 percent, to around $55, after OPEC decided to reduce output. The index of commodities excluding energy declined this month by about 3 percent, after increasing in the previous month. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for January 2017 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target range of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The Monetary Committee continues to assess that in view of the inflation environment, and of developments in the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time. Following are the main considerations underlying the decision: C 2B 7C 2B 7<span style 3Dfont-size:7 pt;line-height:normal;font-family:'times new roman'> The picture of real economic activity remains positive. Based on preliminary data from the Companies Survey, it may be assessed that in the fourth quarter as well, business sector product grew at a pace similar to that of previous quarters. Labor market data continue to indicate a high level of employment, a low level of unemployment, and a continued increase in wages. The Research Department assesses that GDP increased by 3.5 percent in 2016, and that in the coming years it will continue to grow by an annual rate of around 3 percent or slightly higher.

Political developments in some advanced economies are likely to weigh further on trade growth. In the US, there was an acceleration in activity in the second half of the year, while in Europe growth is moderate and the risks to its persistence are relatively large. The US federal funds rate was increased and the expected future interest rate path rose as well; in contrast, the ECB extended the horizon of its quantitative easing.

The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market.

Armenia,2016-12-27,"Press Release 27.12.2016 At the December 27, 2016 meeting, the Board of the CBA decided to reduce the Refinancing Rate by 0.25 pp, setting it at 6.25%. Inflation in November was 1.0% compared with 0.6% of inflation in the same month of the previous year, and the 12-month deflation rate continued reducing to 0.6%. According to the CBA estimates, the deflationary environment will persist in the forthcoming months. A slow pace of global economic growth persisted while some inflationary patterns were observable in international commodity markets. The CBA Board estimates that significant inflationary effects from the external sector are not yet likely in the upcoming months. However, there are some inflationary risks related to the raising of the policy rate by the US Federal Reserve and how it would affect the developing countries. The CBA Board notes that economic activity continues to slow down mainly due to supply factors, such as more-than-expected decline in the agricultural sector. On the other hand, the domestic demand has been rebounding largely thanks to the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies implemented in 2015-2016. Yet, some deflationary risks outlined in the fourth quarter's monetary policy program, including a decline in inflation expectations and anticipated reduction in electricity tariff in February, are materializing. This makes persistence of inflation within the lower bound of the confidence band most likely for 2017. In this case, the CBA Board considers it reasonable to loosen monetary conditions for another time. The CBA Board believes that implemented monetary policy has triggered sufficient incentives to overcome the deflationary environment in 2017 and fulfil the inflation target in the forecast horizon. The CBA Board estimates that interest rates have reduced substantially while conventional monetary policy capabilities are now limited. Yet, the CBA remains committed to its primary goal of ensuring price stability and, if necessary, it will react accordingly by using its toolkit to fulfil the inflation target in the medium term. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) due on January 13, 2017. Press Service of the CBA."
Egypt,2016-12-29,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release December 29, 2016 In its meeting held on December 29, 2016, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 1475 percent, 1575 percent, and 1525 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1525 percen. Annual headline inflation rose to 1943 percent in November 2016 from 1356 percent in October 2016, as the monthly rate increased to 485 percent in November from 170 percent in Octobe. Consumer prices during November were strongly impacted by the economic reform measures related to the foreign exchange rate market liberalization as well as the hydrocarbon subsidies adjustmen. The bulk of the monthly increase occurred due to core items, particularly food and retail, which came in addition to higher regulated price. Consequently annual core inflation rose to 2073 percent in November 2016 from 1572 percent in October 2016, while the monthly rate rose to 533 percent in November from 281 percent in Octobe. In the meantime, annual real GDP maintained a steady pace of growth during 2015/16, registering 43 percent compared 44 percent in 2014/1. Labor market data show that the unemployment rate narrowed to 125 percent in the quarter ending June 2016 after peaking at 134 percent in the quarter ending December 2013, which coincided with lower real unit labor costs since 201. The unemployment rate inched up to 126 percent in the quarter ending September 201. Developments in the external environment show that there has been some firming of international commodity prices, while low global inflation and subdued global growth maintain weak pressures on domestic prices, respectivel. From the monetary perspective, broad and reserve money growth are likely to be impacted going forward by the phasing out of monetary financing of the fiscal deficit as well as by relatively higher foreign reserves accumulatio. Moreover broad money growth is strongly affected by the revaluation effects of its foreign currency component. Looking ahead, annual inflation is expected to narrow after being impacted by transitory cost- push factors stemming from the economic reform measure. The MPC had acted preemptively in its extraordinary meeting on November 3, 2016 by raising the key CBE rates 300 basis points in anticipation of the inflationary pressure. At this juncture and given the balance of risks, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriat. The MPC reiterates its price stability mandate and will continue to closely monitor all economic and monetary developments, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.
