Euroarea,2000-01-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Let me first say that, as expected, the transition of the euro area financial markets to the year 2000 went smoothly. This positive outcome reflects the careful preparation of the banking and financial community as well as the comprehensive and flexible operational framework of the Eurosystem. As you will be aware, the ECB took some precautionary measures to ensure against any problem in the transition to the year 2000, including the provision of sufficient liquidity in the money market during the period around the century date change. After the successful transition to the year 2000 there is no longer any need to extend the current situation of abundant liquidity. Therefore, the Eurosystem this morning conducted a liquidity-absorbing operation amounting to EUR 14.4 billion. The operation contributed to restoring more normal liquidity conditions. The Governing Council today conducted its regular examination of the current outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem was left at 3.0% and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were maintained at 4.0% and 2.0% respectively. Allow me to give you an overview of the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary, financial market and other economic developments. Let me start with the latest monetary developments in the euro area. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, covering the period from September to November 1999, was 6.0%, that is to say slightly higher than the figure of 5.9% recorded for the three-month period from August to October 1999. Accordingly, it remained around 1½ percentage points above the reference value of 4½%. Overall, current liquidity conditions in the euro area continue to be generous. This is also confirmed by the continued strong growth of loans to the private sector (10.1% in November, compared with 9.9% in October 1999). Moving to the euro area financial markets, as we have already noted, it is clear that they were able to weather the century date change without encountering any major problems. The associated risk premium in short-term interest rates had already declined in the last week of December 1999 and had completely disappeared by the time the markets opened on 3 January 2000. Long-term government bond yields have climbed by around 30 basis points since end-November, partly in tandem with bond yields in the United States, but also in response to a more optimistic outlook for the euro area economy. At today's meeting the Governing Council also focused on the economic outlook. In particular, note was taken of the fact that activity in the world economy is continuing to gain momentum as projections for world output growth have been revised upwards recently. This mainly reflects the sustained and high level of growth of the US economy, but also the broad upturn in growth in other industrialised countries and the strong recovery in Asian emerging market economies. The latest developments relating to economic activity in the euro area have contributed to the improved outlook for the global economy and are consistent with the expectation that growth differentials between the main economic regions will narrow. A recent estimate for euro area real GDP growth in the third quarter of 1999 clearly confirmed the widely expected upturn in growth. Survey data for the industrial sector point to continued solid output growth in the final quarter of last year. In addition, private consumption growth should benefit further from continued employment growth and a high level of consumer confidence. As regards consumer price developments, the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) increased further in November 1999. To a large extent the upward movement in November reflects higher price increases for energy and unprocessed food, which is similar to the situation observed in previous months. The annual rate of change in the overall HICP was 1.6%, following an increase of 1.4% in October. When discussing the risks to price stability, the Governing Council recognised that, in the short term, consumer price developments are expected to remain subject to further upward pressure. This is mainly due to higher oil prices, but also to developments in the effective exchange rate of the euro and to a gradual unwinding of the earlier downward movements in food prices. The combined effect of these factors is expected to lead to a peak in the overall HICP increase in early 2000 and to lessen thereafter. Therefore, taken by itself, the upward movement in the rate of increase in the HICP expected for early 2000 should not give undue cause for concern. However, in terms of the outlook for price stability in the medium term, it is essential that the immediate upward movement does not translate into general inflationary pressures and, in particular, that it does not trigger second round effects such as excessive wage claims. In conclusion, the available indicators confirm our previous analysis and assessment on the overall situation as regards the risks to price stability. Against this background, we remain both confident and vigilant. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to introduce some of the additional topics. I should like to draw your attention to two items not directly linked to today's meeting of the Governing Council. The first one deals with one aspect of the ECB's monetary policy competence. Pursuant to the Treaty (Article 106 ) the ECB has the exclusive right to approve the volume of coins issued by the euro area Member States. To this end, the Governing Council adopted, in late December, a Decision on the volume of coin issuance in 2000. This Decision will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities shortly. The second item relates to the Executive Board's decision to adjust the ECB's organisational structure according to the needs of a still growing institution on the one hand and to better accommodate the challenges ahead on the other. Among the changes you will find an upgrading of the Directorate Statistics to a Directorate General, in order to enhance its role as provider of monetary and financial statistics to the general public, as well as a restructuring of the Directorate General Economics. An updated organisational chart is available in the room this afternoon."
South Korea,2000-01-06,"Although the real sector has continued to grow rapidly, the current account has remained in surplus and consumer prices are expected to hold stable for some time, owing in part to the appreciation of the won. The financial markets have not yet achieved stability. The imbalance in the bond market is likely to continue as investment trust companies offload bond to gather liquidity to meet higher redemption payouts to their clients on Daewoo bonds Taking these factors into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea has decided that overnight call rate will be maintained at around its current level in January. Meanwhile, to guard against a possible realization of inflationary pressures owing to the trend of rapid expansion, it is essential to keep a close eye on indicators of inflationary pressure such as wages, stock prices, and real estate prices as well as on flows of volatile short-term funds."
South Korea,2000-01-13,"Inflation Target Following consultation with the government, the inflation target for the year 2000 has been set at 2., 5\xc2\xb11 percent, based on the annual rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) after stripping out non-cereal agricultural products and petroleum-based products. In addition, the mid-term inflation target which the Bank of Korea will try to achieve from the year 2001 onwards has been set at 2., 5 percent on an annual average basis. Monetary Policy in the Year 2000 This year the Bank of Korea will conduct monetary policy with the focus on strengthening the foundation of price stability needed for sustainable growth of the economy. The target range for the annual M3 growth rate has been set at 7 to 10 percent, based on the inflation target(2., 5\xc2\xb11%), the forecast economic growth, and the decreasing demand for M3 in the process of firms' balance sheet adjustment. Trend of M3 Growth Rate (period average, %) Dec., 1995Dec., 1996Dec., 1997 Dec., 1998 1999 2000 target June Dec., e) 18., 8 17., 1 15., 9 12., 4 12., 7 8 or so 7\x88\xbc10 This year's target range for M3 growth is wider than last year's, in consideration of the heightened volatility of monetary aggregates since greater policy consideration came to be placed on interest rate movements than on money supply. It is expected that the M3 growth path this year will stay close to the lower bound of its target range in the first half while nudging its upper limit in the second half. This anticipation is drawn from its path last year when M3 growth was high in the first half and fell sharply in the second half. Greater attention will be paid to narrower monetary aggregates such as M1 and M2 to obtain more accurate information on portfolio shifts and overall liquidity conditions in the financial market. In the year 2000, the Bank of Korea will act preemptively in its interest rate policy should inflationary pressure be likely to emerge, taking into due consideration developments in real economic activities and the movements of asset prices. This will help ensure price stability and, in turn, stabilize long term market rates. Meanwhile, it is necessary that the conduct of interest rate policy be coordinated closely with that of exchange rate policy, as well as that of fiscal policy, because the recent surge in the scale of capital inflows and outflows makes it even more important to maintain both domestic and external equilibria. The Bank of Korea will introduce a new standing facility whose object will be to meet the temporary liquidity needs of individual banks. Interest rates on this facility, along with the key policy rate (the overnight call rate), will be adjusted in line with changes in the monetary policy stance to improve interest rate signaling. The scale of the facility will be decided for each quarter, and within it individual lending will be made only after screening an applicant bank's financial status. A further lending facility of daylight overdraft, which will be a real- time, zero-interest service to clear unsettled balances, will also be launched as part of efforts to facilitate intraday payment and settlement among financial institutions and avoid any disruption in the smooth operation of BOK-Wire. The Bank of Korea will consider ways to reduce the issue and circulation of post-dated promissory notes in the economy because this practice has been open to abuse, imposing a financial burden on payee small and medium enterprises and leading to multiple defaults on payment."
South Africa,2000-01-13,"The Monetary Policy Committee, meeting over two days on 12 and 13 January 2000, made a detailed assessment of changes in general economic conditions since its last meeting on 25 November 1999. The main conclusions of the Committee are summarised in this statement. INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS International economic indicators that have become available since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee generally confirm the improved world economic conditions perceived at that time. The latest projections of the OECD have been revised sharply upward. In the OECD Economic Outlook for December 1999 the growth in world output is projected to accelerate from 3 per cent in 1999 to around 3½ per cent in both 2000 and 2001. Growth expectations for Africa. Asia and Latin America have also improved. Although the higher global economic growth is expected to take place under relatively stable economic conditions, consumer price inflation has accelerated somewhat as a result of higher oil and other international commodity prices. Mainly because of supply-side constraints, oil prices increased to an average level of US$25,50 per barrel in December 1999, compared with just above US$10 a year ago. Concerns about inflationary pressures arising from this and other developments caused the monetary authorities of industrial countries to tighten monetary policy in the last half of 1999. However, rates in emerging markets have generally been flat or trended downwards. DOMESTIC REAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS Recently released economic data confirm the previously noted improvement in domestic economic activity. In particular, the composite coincident business cycle indicator (an index derived from a range of statistics showing the present state of the business cycle) displayed a sharp rise in the three-month period from June to August 1999. Other economic indicators showing improved conditions include an increase in mining production during September and October 1999, a rising trend in manufacturing output in the second half of 1999, an increase in electricity generated from June 1999, a sharp rise in the value of total unfilled orders from July to October 1999 and a distinctly increasing trend in retail and wholesale sales from the beginning of the year. The recovery in economic activity took place from a relatively low level and has not yet brought about any improvement in reported formal-sector employment. In fact, the available data indicate that the number of people employed in the non-agricultural sectors of the economy declined by about 80 000 in the first nine months of 1999. Decreases in employment were recorded in the mining, manufacturing and construction sectors. Despite the rise in unemployment, the average year-on-year rate of increase in nominal salaries and wages per employee rose from 7,1 per cent in the first quarter of 1999 to 8,8 per cent in the third quarter. This acceleration was mainly due to wage increases in the public sector from a low base. Growth in the average nominal remuneration per worker in the private sector continued to rise at high levels of between 8 and 9 per cent during this period. The increase in wages per worker was countered to some extent by the acceleration in the growth of labour productivity from a year-on-year rate of 1,9 per cent in the first quarter of 1999 to 3,6 per cent in the third quarter. As a result, nominal unit labour costs rose by only 5,0 per cent from the third quarter of 1998 to the third quarter of 1999. DOMESTIC MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS The relatively small increase in nominal unit labour costs was an important contributing factor to a moderation in consumer price inflation to a year-on-year rate of 1,7 per cent in October 1999. The downward movement in consumer price increases was, however, mainly the result of a fall in mortgage bond rates. The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index rose marginally to 1,9 per cent in November 1999 because of increases in the prices of food, medical care and transport services. Sharp increases in petrol and diesel prices kept core inflation at a level of 8,1 per cent in November and the year-on-year increase in the production price index at 6,3 per cent in the same month. Moreover, if the effects of reductions in interest rates are not taken into account, there was a moderate increasing trend in inflation during 1999. The Monetary Policy Committee, meeting over two days on 12 and 13 January 2000, made a detailed assessment of changes in general economic conditions since its last meeting on 25 November 1999. The growth in broad money supply (M3) measured over a period of twelve months remained firmly below 10 per cent from February 1999 and amounted to 8,5 per cent in November. However, an annualised increase of 24 per cent was recorded in the seasonally adjusted value of M3 over the three months from the end of August to the end of November 1999. This sharp growth in M3 was concentrated in notes and coin, and cheque and call deposits. During December 1999 the rand traded in a narrow range of R6,12 to R6,17 per dollar and remained strong against most major currencies. The nominal effective exchange rate of the rand increased by 0,3 per cent in this month. Over the year as a whole, the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand rose by 0,6 per cent. However, the average level of the rand decreased by 8½ per cent in 1999. In the first week of January 2000 the rand strengthened marginally. In accordance with the decisions taken at the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting on 25 November 1999, the rate on repurchase transactions was kept fixed at 12,00 per cent in the ensuing period and full liquidity was provided to banks at the daily auctions of the Reserve Bank. This resulted in relatively stable money market interest rates and yields over the past six weeks. International economic indicators that have become available since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee generally confirm the improved world economic conditions perceived at that time. Recently released economic data confirm the previously noted improvement in domestic economic activity. In fact, the available data indicate that the number of people employed in the non-agricultural sectors of the economy declined by about 80 000 in the first nine months of 1999. The relatively small increase in nominal unit labour costs was an important contributing factor to a moderation in consumer price inflation to a year-on-year rate of 1,7 per cent in October 1999. The value of total credit extended by the monetary institutions contracted from approximately R558 billion at the end of September 1999 to R555 billion at the end of November, largely owing to a reduction in banks' claims on the government sector. The twelve-month growth rate in credit extended to the private sector receded from 11,5 per cent in September 1999 to 8,2 per cent in November. In order to alleviate possible Y2K problems, the Reserve Bank has actively engineered a sharp decline in the banks' liquidity requirement since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. The liquidity requirement of banks consequently declined by R3,8 billion from R6,2 billion on 25 November 1999 to R2,4 billion on 31 December, despite an increase of R6,7 billion in notes and coin in circulation. At R32,7 billion at the end of 1999 the level of notes and coin in circulation was well below the market's expectations. Money market interest rates eased slightly further from 25 November to 31 December 1999, while yields on government bonds decreased by approximately ½ percentage point over this period. In the first week of the new year there was a rally in the bond market, which brought yields to a level below 13 per cent. Activity on the bond and share markets remained buoyant and the value of real estate transactions rebounded from deeply depressed levels at the beginning of 1999 to more normal levels in August. From the beginning of October to the end of December 1999 share prices rose by no less than 23 per cent, bringing the total increase from their lower turning point in September 1998 to 65 per cent. The most recent increase in the all-share price index was mainly the result of gains recorded by financial and industrial shares. Non-residents played an important part in these price developments, increasing their holdings of South African bonds and equities further by R3,3 billion and R0,8 billion, respectively, during December 1999. For the calendar year as a whole non-residents increased their holdings of domestic bonds by R14,3 billion and their equity holdings by R40,6 billion. The corresponding figures for 1998 were net sales of bonds to the amount of R9,8 billion and net purchases of equities to the value of R42,3 billion. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET. Trade figures for the first two months of the fourth quarter of 1999 indicate that the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments probably deteriorated further in the fourth quarter of 1999. The trade surplus declined from an average monthly value of R1,6 billion in the third quarter of 1999 to an average of only R0,4 billion in October and November 1999. The weaker trade surplus was the result of an increase in the value of merchandise imports, which outweighed increases in the value of the exports of gold and other goods. The financial account of South Africa with the rest of the world was probably characterised by a substantial increase in the inflow of capital, as indicated by a rise of R6,2 billion in the gross foreign reserves of the Reserve Bank during the fourth quarter to a level of R45,4 billion at the end of December. From 25 November 1999 the net open position in foreign currency declined further to a level of US$13 billion at the end of the year, i.e. close to pre-crisis levels. This was consistent with the Bank's intention to continue reducing the net open position in foreign exchange. The banking sector's thorough preparations to avoid the possible effects of the transition to the year 2000, proved to be very effective. With the exception of a few minor disruptions which generally were not Y2K related, normal operations were reported by the banks during the first week of the new millennium. The positive spin-offs of large-scale technology renewal, systematic rationalisation of systems and processes, the improvement of human resources and closer co-operation in the sector, can significantly enhance efficiency. The way that the banks and corporates managed the millennium date change has been commendable. The Monetary Policy Committee expresses its appreciation to the management of these institutions for their actions that ensured that South Africa coped well with the transition to the new millennium. In addition, the Committee commends the members of the public for their mature and responsible behaviour over the year end. The latest available statistical information suggests that conditions in the banking sector remained stable and profitability improved during October and November 1999. Although some of the smaller banks at times experienced a temporary liquidity squeeze due to the reduction of wholesale deposits, these problems were dealt with quickly and efficiently. A noticeable change was also reported in the anticipated short-term liquidity mismatch of banks which, measured as a percentage of their total funding, decreased from a level of approximately 12 per cent in the four months June to September 1999 to about 9 per cent in October and just slightly above 10 per cent in November. As already indicated, the inflation rate has started to increase somewhat, primarily due to the substantial rise in international oil prices. Wage increases could also contribute to a moderate increase in the inflation rate over the next few months if they are not neutralised by productivity gains. However, over the more medium to longer term the inflation outlook is still promising and this has been enhanced by the recent further restructuring of the trade regime. Most projections indicate that the average inflation rate is expected to decline over the next two years. The projections of the Reserve Bank show a similar trend provided that the exchange rate of the rand remains relatively stable, the growth in money supply and bank credit extension is contained and that positive real interest rates are maintained. The Monetary Policy Committee in its deliberations expressed concern about the continued shedding of jobs in South Africa. Unemployment is a structural problem that requires significant supply-side adjustments in the economy. After careful consideration of international and domestic economic developments and the successful transition to the new millennium, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank decided to discontinue the temporary measure of fixing the repo rate at 12 per cent. The Bank will again apply a variable-rate auction in accordance with the agreed signalling procedures from Friday, 14 January 2000. Although the repo rate will be determined at the daily auctions of the Bank, the Monetary Policy Committee believes that recent changes in short-term interest rates warrant an immediate reduction to 11,75 per cent in the rate at the first auction on Friday. This reduction should allow the banks to reduce their prime overdraft rate with immediate effect by 100 basis points. The Monetary Policy Committee is of the opinion that the daily liquidity requirement of the banks must then be managed in such a way that short-term money market rates remain at or around this level, as the Committee is of the considered view that current and projected conditions do not at present warrant a further reduction in interest rates."
Chile,2000-01-27,"Santiago. January 27, 2000 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank analyzed the situation of recent weeks and the outlook for the next 24 months. The analysis covered the recovery of the Chilean economy, the improvement of the world economic environment, the increasing pressure of international inflation and the effects on Chile's inflation of the higher prices of some products and services (particularly fuels and transport) that have been announced or are foreseeable. In conclusion, the Board agreed that inflation would probably rise during the year 2000, largely because of higher prices of some specific items, and it could even go above the level announced in September if oil prices continue as high as they have been during the past two months. The Board considered that the outlook for inflation in 2001 is more favorable than that for 2000 since inflation will probably drop once the specific price hikes have been fully assimilated. However, price pressures and the consolidation of economic recovery increase the risk of inflation rising beyond the medium-term target. The economic reactivation apparent in recent months and the prospect of it continuing make it advisable to moderate the monetary impulse given since June 1999. The Board thus decided to slightly raise the monetary policy interest rate by twenty-five basis points from UF plus 5% to UF plus 5.25% and the liquidity credit lines by the same amount each."
Euroarea,2000-02-03,"the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. At today's meeting the Governing Council decided to increase the ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. As a consequence, the forthcoming main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be conducted as fixed rate tenders at an interest rate of 3.25%, starting with the operation to be settled on 9 February 2000. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be increased from 4.0% to 4.25% and that on the deposit facility from 2.0% to 2.25%, both with effect from 4 February 2000. These decisions were taken on the basis of an assessment of the risks to price stability in the medium term in the context of the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy. Considering the first pillar of this strategy, both monetary and credit growth continue to signal generous liquidity conditions. Monetary growth has consistently been above the reference value and credit to the private sector is continuing to grow at more than 10%. These developments are indicative of upside risks to price stability in the medium term. As for the second pillar of the monetary policy strategy, price and cost increases - including oil and non-energy commodity prices as well as producer prices - have been larger and more protracted than foreseen earlier and hence indicate risks of ""second round"" effects. Such risks, which are of a more enduring nature, are further increased by the fact that the international environment is showing continuous signs of improvement and the prospects of a cyclical upswing in the euro area are very strong. Indeed, internal and external factors reinforce one another and thereby contribute to intensifying the growth of the real GDP of the euro area. The depreciation of the euro which we have witnessed is contributing to increases in import prices. Timely and appropriate monetary policy adjustments should ensure that these risks are kept under control, so that risk premia in financial markets will be diminished. The Governing Council's determination to counter threats of inflation should assure wage negotiators that the prospects for price stability remain favourable. In fact, it will be important to ensure that wage settlements themselves do not constitute a threat to price stability in the medium term. Allow me to give you a more detailed overview of the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary, financial market and other economic developments. Starting with the first pillar, there has been an upward movement in most recent monetary developments in the euro area. Base effects have largely contributed to the fact that the three-month average of the annual growth rate of M3 - covering the period from October to December 1999 - rose to 6.1%, after having stood at 6.0% in the three-month period ending in November 1999. At 10.5%, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector continued to be high in December 1999. Considering the prolonged deviation of M3 growth from the reference value of 4 1/2% throughout 1999, as well as the ongoing strong expansion of credit, monetary and credit developments observed remain an important factor contributing to the upside risks to price stability. Turning to the second pillar, long-term nominal interest rates signal increased expectations of a lasting upswing in the euro area economy. Between the end of December 1999 and the end of January 2000 ten-year government bond yields in the euro area increased further to reach the highest level observed since late 1997. Developments in the exchange rate of the euro are becoming a cause for concern with regard to future price stability. At the end of January the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro stood approximately 11 1/2% below its level in the first quarter of 1999. Given both the magnitude and the duration of this development, import prices can be expected to rise further, thereby increasing the risk that upward pressures on consumer price inflation might materialise in the medium term. It is all the more important to take such risks into account given that the outlook for the world economy has improved further. There are increasing signs that the upturn in world growth has become more broadly based across economic areas. In addition to the US economy continuing to enjoy robust growth, activity is also accelerating in other industrialised countries and the recovery is strong in both Asian and Latin American emerging market economies. Following the acceleration in real GDP growth from the second to the third quarter of 1999, economic activity in the euro area can also be expected to have seen a strong expansion in the last quarter of 1999. Inter alia, the high level of industrial and consumer confidence reached in the last quarter of 1999 and the prospect of ongoing employment growth and further falling unemployment, as reflected in most recent data, all point to ongoing improvements. With regard to consumer price developments, the rate of inflation - as measured by increases in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) - has moved up further. The rise in the annual rate of change in the overall HICP from 1.5% in November to 1.7% in December 1999 was almost entirely due to an annual increase in energy prices. Our expectation is that we shall see higher inflation rates in the next few months. Inflation rates are now approaching higher levels than expected earlier, and larger and more protracted commodity and producer price increases are heightening the risk of second round effects. Against this background it is crucial for wage negotiators to be able to rely on the maintenance of price stability in the medium term. In conclusion, it is the responsibility of the Governing Council to maintain price stability, thereby contributing to ensuring sustainable growth in the euro area. In order to maintain price stability, monetary policy needs to act in a forward-looking manner, counteracting external and domestic risks in a timely fashion. Growth in the euro area is now robust and, in order to maintain favourable conditions for a lasting economic expansion, social partners will need to keep wage increases consistent with price stability, as well as compatible with continued growth in employment. Governments will have to enhance the structural reform process in order to strengthen the economy in a durable manner. Such reforms will not only make a great contribution to the euro area remaining attractive for domestic investors, but will also contribute to increasing its attractiveness for investors located abroad. Overall, consistently acting in line with these responsibilities appears to be most conducive to maintaining price stability at the domestic level and to ensuring robust growth."
South Korea,2000-02-10,"Although the business upswing has continued, inflationary pressures remain subdued. The current account also remains in surplus. January's trade deficit notwithstanding. In the meantime, the financial markets appear to be regaining overall stability. The supply of bank credit has continued to increase, and long- term market rates have shown a gradual decline, while bond market trading, which had long been inactive, has taken off remarkably. In addition the outflow of funds from investment trust companies(ITCs) since up to 95% redemption was allowed on their funds with Daewoo exposure on February 2 has been much less than feared. This has resulted in the soothing of factors making for market instability to a very large degree. On the other hand, the overnight call rate has been kept low to defuse the threat to financial market stability, although long-term interest rates had been rising in response to the rapid expansion of the real economy and fears of financial market instability, thus widening the spread between long-term and short-term rates. A concentration of funds at the short-term end of the market and a reduction in the efficiency of interest rate policy have been among the unfortunate effects. Taking these points into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea has decided to raise its target for the overnight call rate from around 4., 75 percent to around 5., 00 percent in February. It is anticipated that today's increase, which has largely been discounted by the markets, will narrow the differential between long-term and short-term rates since long-term rates have shown an underlying downtrend with the recent soothing of market instability."
Israel,2000-02-21,"February 21, 2000 Monetary program for March 2000 The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for March 2000 today, according to which its interest rate will be reduced by 0.4 percentage points. The Bank of Israel pointed out that this reduction is consistent with attaining the government's inflation target, and hence also supports attaining the government's other targets, without jeopardizing the attainment of the inflation target. The Bank of Israel stressed that attaining the government's inflation target, within the framework of striving for price stability over time, creates the infrastructure necessary for sustainable growth. The Bank of Israel explained that the reduction of the interest rate is a continuation of the process of interest-rate reduction that was implemented recently and that depends on the consolidation of the path of expected inflation for the one- and two-year periods ahead in a way that is consistent with 4 percent for D 7A 1attaining the government's inflation target of an annual rate of 3 the years 2000 and 2001. This consolidation dependson the absence of exogenous shocks in the area of inflation, such as the upward trend of global interest rates and its implications for capital flows, on the one hand, and for the management of the public's portfolio of assets and liabilities and repercussions on Israel's financial markets, on the other. In this context, the Bank of Israel noted that in view of the current currency composition of the foreign-currency assets and liabilities held by the public, as well as of the capital flows to and from Israel, the dollar interest rate is the main substitute for local-currency interest, and hence referring to interest-rate spreads means referring to the spread between dollar and local-currency interest <i>plus the risk premium for Israel-as measured in the international capital markets-and exchange-rate risk. The Bank of Israel pointed out that the interest-rate spreads, as referred to here, are narrowing. The Bank of Israel stressed that the assessment of expected inflation for an horizon of one and two years is the basis for making decisions regarding the interest rate, in view of the government's decisionregarding the inflation target for the next two years. The assessment of inflationis based primarily on analyzing the various inflation forecasts for a period of a year or more, which are based on various indicators, e.g., inflation expectations, exchange-rate developments, the rise in the money supply, price trends abroad, the nature of fiscal policy, and the level of real economic activity. In this context, the Bank of Israel noted that the analysis of the data published in the various fields for a given month-including the last one-is relevant for the decision regarding the monthly interest rate only if it can affect the assessment of the inflation rate forecast for a one-and two-year horizon. The monthly data themselves do not constitute an adequate basis for assessing inflation for this horizon, or for making the monthly interest-rate policy decision. Monetary program for March 2000 The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for March 2000 today, according to which its interest rate will be reduced by 0.4 percentage points."
Chile,2000-02-24,"Santiago. February 24, 2000 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to leave the monetary policy interest rate at its current level of UF plus 5.25%. The Board carried out a detailed analysis of developments of recent weeks and the outlook for the next 24 months. Figures available since the previous meeting in January point to the inflationary pressures of fuel price rises and the effect they will also have on public transport and transport in general. If the higher international prices are maintained and depending on the outcome of ongoing negotiations, inflation could rise above forecasts. However, although cost pressures imply price rises this year they are considered to be temporary. Similarly, domestic demand remains within the foreseen limits and there are expectations of only modest inflation following the monetary policy interest rate rise in January. The Board therefore decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at its current level of UF plus 5.25% and the liquidity credit lines at their present levels. However, the Board indicated that price rises originating from cost pressures will be accompanied by a stricter monetary policy if such pressures or others jeopardize the medium-term achievement of inflationary targets. The Board will watch the way in which rises in inflation are incorporated into market expectations and adjustment mechanisms of managed prices. The Bank will remain attentive to how domestic demand evolves and also to developments in exchange and financial markets at home and abroad, considering that monetary policy still maintains an expansive position."
Euroarea,2000-03-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today's meetings of the General Council and the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of the outlook for price developments in the euro area. After reviewing the evidence available from both the first and the second pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem, the Governing Council decided to maintain the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem at 3.25% and the interest rate on the marginal lending facility and that on the deposit facility at 4.25% and 2.25% respectively, i.e. at the levels determined a month ago. The Governing Council also concluded that the balance of risks to price stability in the medium term remains on the upside. These upside risks will need to be monitored and assessed continuously in order to ensure that timely action can be taken, if and when required. The main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary, financial market and other economic developments are as follows. Starting with the monetary indicators covered under the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 for the period from November 1999 to January 2000 was 5.7%, compared with 6.0% in the last quarter of 1999. The reduction was determined by a base effect, since the monthly increase in M3 in January 1999 was exceptionally strong, reflecting the special environment at the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union. At the same time, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector remained high, at 9.5% in January 2000. Overall, the prolonged deviation of M3 growth from the reference value of 4½%, especially when seen in conjunction with the dynamic growth of credit, indicates that liquidity conditions in the euro area remain generous. With regard to the second pillar, as usual, the Governing Council examined a broad range of indicators. Starting with long-term nominal interest rates, there was little change in the course of February. The yield curve remained relatively steep, thus indicating expectations of strong economic growth in the period ahead. Such expectations are partly based on the favourable outlook for the world economy. A key element underlying this positive outlook is the fact that the US economy is continuing to grow at a high rate, but the strong recovery and the acceleration of growth in other areas also support this view. The strongest level of performance is currently being recorded in emerging market economies in South-East Asia, while the broad outlook in Japan remains uncertain. There is also further evidence that economic activity in the euro area continued to expand strongly after the third quarter of last year. While euro area estimates for the fourth quarter of 1999 are not yet available, data for individual Member States point to continued robust output growth. In addition, area-wide industrial confidence increased further around the turn of the year and consumer confidence remained at the high level reached in the last two months of 1999. The cyclical upswing should extend well into 2000 and continue thereafter. This is also confirmed by available forecasts, which point to real GDP growth of slightly over 3% in 2000. As for 2001, the economic expansion in the euro area is generally expected to continue at a similar pace. Developments in the exchange rate of the euro, which do not reflect the underlying strength of the euro area economy, remain a cause for concern. Their upward impact on import prices is having a negative effect on the price climate and is thereby increasing the risks to price stability in the medium term. With regard to most recent developments in consumer price inflation, as measured by annual increases in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the upward movement has continued. In January 2000 the annual rate of HICP inflation was 2.0%, up from 1.7% in December 1999. As in earlier months, the latest upward movement is the result of the increase in energy prices, which, on an annual basis, reached 12.0% in January. Excluding the more volatile components, namely energy and seasonal food. HICP inflation in January increased slightly to 1.1% on account of somewhat higher price increases for non-energy industrial goods. While it is likely that annual inflation rates will fall again in the course of 2000, owing to base effects related to the price of oil, monetary policy-makers need to look beyond developments over the next few months, i.e. policy will need to focus on the risks to price stability in the medium term. Indeed, whereas most forecasts still point to average inflation of below 2% in 2000 and 2001, they are based on rather favourable assumptions and generally seem to imply a pattern which is characterised first by decreasing rates of inflation in the course of this year and then by more fundamental upward tendencies later on. Against this background, the Governing Council concluded that vigilance is required and pointed to several factors. First, developments in monetary and credit aggregates will need to be analysed continuously in order to assess upward risks to price stability. Second, in view of the improving economic conditions, the potential spillover of large and protracted increases in import and producer prices into consumer prices will need to be assessed carefully. In this context, developments in the exchange rate and in oil prices will play a major role. It will be essential, both for maintaining price stability and for reducing the high level of unemployment, that wage settlements remain moderate and do not themselves contribute to inflation expectations, which would also endanger the sustainability of the current upswing. Fiscal policies can make a substantive contribution to maintaining favourable economic conditions by using the current upswing as an excellent opportunity to proceed swiftly towards fulfilling the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact. Economic conditions and perspectives in the euro area appear to be better at present than at any time in the past decade. Growth is strong, employment is expected to increase further and the still very high level of unemployment should continue to fall. Remaining vigilant to counter upside risks to price stability and pursuing structural reform is the foundation for a sustained period of strong economic growth and a lasting process of job creation. Finally. I should like to draw your attention to two items not directly linked to today's meeting of the Governing Council. First. I should like to inform you that on 30 March 2000 the Governing Council will meet for the first time outside Frankfurt, namely in Madrid. It is our intention that Governing Council meetings will be held in other euro area Member States twice a year. In the second half of this year it is envisaged that the Governing Council will meet in Paris. Second, on 2 and 3 November 2000 the ECB will hold its first Central Banking Conference. The topic of the conference will be ""Why price stability?"" and it will take place in Frankfurt. The ECB's Central Banking Conference, which will be organised biennially, will bring together invited participants from central banks, international and European institutions, academia and the press. As of today, regularly updated information, including a preliminary programme, will be provided on the ECB's Web site. The final programme for the conference and all the papers, comments and a summary of the discussions will be made available on the ECB's Web site in due course."
South Africa,2000-03-02,"The main conclusions made at the Monetary Policy Committee meeting of 1 and 2 March 2000 are summarised in this statement. The growth in money supply accelerated strongly in the second half of 1999. The rate of increase over twelve-month periods in the broadly defined money supply (M3) increased from a low of 5,5 per cent in August 1999 to 10,2 per cent in January 2000. Although low growth in money supply is no longer an intermediate objective of monetary policy, it remains an important indicator of financial stability and will still be monitored closely by the central bank as one of the important variables in the determination of monetary policy. The yields on domestic bonds have moved to slightly higher levels since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, probably in response to higher short-term interest rates in the main international markets. Activity on the bond and share markets remained buoyant, but was lower in the fourth quarter of 1999 in comparison with the high figures of the preceding quarter. For the year 1999 as a whole, turnover in the secondary bond market increased to R8,8 trillion from the very high R8,5 trillion in 1998. The value of shares traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange came to R448 billion in 1999, or to 40 per cent more than in 1998. Share prices rallied to a new record level on 17 January 2000, before declining again by 13½ per cent until 29 February. The real estate market continued to recover in the closing months of 1999. The positive international economic outlook reported after the end of the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee continue to prevail. Global growth prospects remain favourable, although there are some signs of an acceleration of inflation in industrial countries. Since the beginning of 2000 most of the member countries of the OECD, with the notable exception of Japan, have increased their official interest rates as a precautionary measure to quell rising inflationary pressures exacerbated by higher commodity prices. In the emerging-market economies, by contrast, there was no dominant trend in the path of official interest rates. In particular, international oil prices moved up further from just below US$23 per barrel on 11 January 2000 to above US$28 per barrel from the middle of February. This upward movement was mainly attributable to the product-cut accord of the main oil producers. The gold price also gained about US$25 per fine ounce early in February primarily because a number of producers bought gold back that was previously sold forward. On 29 February 2000 the fixing price of gold had fallen back again to about US$294 per fine ounce. The upturn in economic activity that was noted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee at the beginning of January 2000, was confirmed by the recently released national accounts data. According to this information the real gross domestic product increased from quarter to quarter at rates in excess of 3 per cent in the second half of 1999. Moreover, the recovery in economic activity became more widespread and the real output of manufacturing enterprises rose at a rate of almost 7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1999. As could be expected under these circumstances, domestic final demand began to pick up. Consumers stepped up their current expenditure in line with lower interest payments on loans and increases in real personal disposable income, without resorting to a large increase in debt for the financing of their outlays. Total gross fixed capital formation still declined in the fourth quarter of 1999, but private-sector fixed investment rose. Real final consumption expenditure by general government continued to decline, while the growth in final demand was supplemented by an increase in total inventories at constant prices. These production and expenditure patterns will, of course, be influenced by the recent floods that have devastated vast areas both in South Africa and Southern Africa. Conditions in the labour market remained relatively depressed, with new jobs only being created in the trade, transport and communication sectors during the first nine months of 1999. Labour productivity increased by 2,7 per cent in the first three quarters of 1999 compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, and helped to contain the growth in nominal unit labour cost to 4,7 per cent over the same period. The low rate of increase in nominal unit labour costs helped to contain the rise in the consumer price index excluding the effect of mortgage rate changes (i.e. in the so-called CPIX in metropolitan and urban areas, which is used to measure inflation in the targets pursued by the authorities). The twelve-month growth rate in CPIX amounted to 7,0 per cent in January 2000. Some inflationary pressures have recently become discernible in the economy due to increases in international oil prices, the prices of transport equipment and, more recently, also in the cost of food. The growth in total credit extended by banks measured over a period of twelve months, which had slowed down from 17,7 per cent in January 1999 to 6,9 per cent in October, increased to 9,8 per cent in January 2000. Reflecting the strengthening in domestic economic activity, this rise in bank credit extension can mainly be attributed to funds made available to private corporations. Households remained reluctant to utilise consumer credit instruments to finance the purchase of durable goods, and banks have become more cautious in the extension of credit. Following the decline in the repo rate of 25 basis points to 11,75 per cent on 14 January 2000, the prime overdraft rate of banks was reduced by one percentage point to 14,50 per cent. The interbank call rate also moved down from 10,25 per cent to 10 per cent on 14 January and 9,50 per cent on 21 January. The changes in other money market rates generally reflected the decline in the prime overdraft rate of the banks. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET. The balance of payments on current account, which had moved into a deficit from the second quarter of 1999, recorded a further deficit in the fourth quarter. This amounted to an estimated seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of approximately R5½ billion, or about ½ per cent of gross domestic product. The appearance of a deficit on the current account at this early stage of a recovery in domestic economic activity was, to a large extent, due to a deterioration in South Africa's terms of trade related to the substantial increase in the price of oil. In the fourth quarter of 1999 the quantity of imports also rose sharply. The financial account of South Africa's balance of payments recorded increasingly positive inflows of capital throughout 1999. In the fourth quarter of 1999 the net inflow of capital is provisionally estimated at R14 billion, which should bring the annual net inflow to about R27 billion. This large inflow of capital consisted mainly of portfolio investments in the form of equity investments. Non-residents' net purchases of shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange amounted to R40,6 billion and their net purchases of bonds to R14,3 billion in 1999. These inflows were offset to some extent by a repayment on foreign loans and investments in foreign financial assets by domestic institutional investors through the asset swap mechanism. In the first two months of 2000, non-residents' net purchases of securities declined to R0,8 billion. The overall balance of payments surplus in the fourth quarter of 1999 led to a further increase in the total gross gold and other foreign reserves from R53,9 billion at the end of September 1999 to R67,5 billion at the end of December. This increased the import cover, i.e. the value of gross international reserves expressed as a ratio of the value of imports of goods and services, to about 15 weeks at the end of 1999. In the first two months of 2000 the gross foreign reserves of the Reserve Bank rose further by R1,6 billion. The net open foreign currency position of the Reserve Bank improved by US$1,9 billion over the same period to US$11,1 billion at the end of February 2000. The exchange rate of the rand was relatively volatile against the US dollar during the first two months of 2000. After having reached a level of R6,06 to the US dollar on 13 January, the rand depreciated sharply to a low of R6,32 at the end of January. During February the rand traded between R6,20 and R6,40 against the US dollar. The depreciation of the rand against the dollar was due to the overall strength of the US currency, as demonstrated by an appreciation of 0,6 per cent in the value of the rand against the Euro in the first two months of 2000. As a consequence the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand declined by only 0,4 per cent from the end of December 1999 to the end of February 2000. Conditions in the banking sector remained stable during the fourth quarter of 1999 and in the first two months of 2000. The gross overdues of the banking sector increased from R28,4 billion in the third quarter of 1999 to R29,4 billion in the fourth quarter. As a ratio of total loans and advances, gross overdues therefore increased slightly from 4,8 per cent to 4,9 per cent over the same period. However, total provisions as a ratio of gross overdues also improved from 53,7 per cent in the third quarter of 1999 to 57,5 per cent in the fourth quarter. This is much higher than the international norm of 40 per cent. The Reserve Bank had deliberately eased liquidity conditions in the money market during the last four months of 1999 to allay fears arising from the millennium change. From the beginning of the new year when it became apparent that no serious Y2K-problems would be experienced, the Bank began to increase the reserve dependency of banks on central bank funding. In order to drain liquidity the Bank entered into foreign exchange swaps with banks, increased the amount of reverse-repurchase transactions and also issued more Reserve Bank debentures. Although these operations were partly offset by a decline in notes and coin in circulation, the liquidity requirement of the banks increased from R2,4 billion at the end of 1999 to R7,7 billion at the end of February 2000. The Reserve Bank provided liquidity to the full extent of the private banks' needs, with the result that only limited use was made of the marginal lending facility during the first two months of 2000. The repo rate of the Reserve Bank at the daily auction remained at a level of 11,75 per cent from 14 January 2000. This constant repo rate probably resulted from the Monetary Policy Committee's conclusion on 13 January 2000 that such a level was regarded as appropriate for South Africa under the circumstances at that time, and that the banks' daily liquidity requirement would be managed in a way which would ensure that the repo rate would remain at or around that level. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, clear signs of increased inflationary pressures have become apparent in the South African economy. Increases in the prices of petrol and diesel, transport equipment and more recently food products have led to accelerated inflation. For example, the imported component of the production price index increased from a twelve-month rate of 7,1 per cent in September 1999 to 13,1 per cent in January 2000, while the rate of increase in domestically produced goods accelerated from 5,2 per cent to 6,5 per cent over the same period. The Monetary Policy Committee will be closely monitoring any second-round effects of these inflationary pressures. Over the medium to longer term, inflation in South Africa is expected to decline again because of monetary and fiscal discipline, international competition, the projected low growth of nominal unit labour costs and excess production capacity in the economy. Given these circumstances, and consistent with the inflation target of 3 to 6 per cent as an average in 2002 as set by the government, the Monetary Policy Committee is of the opinion that the current level of the repo rate is appropriate. In accordance with the decision taken at the previous meeting, the Reserve Bank will therefore continue to manage the banks' daily liquidity requirement in a way that will result in a repo rate at or around 11,75 per cent."
South Korea,2000-03-09,"While the real sector has continued to grow rapidly, the current account surplus has been narrowing faster than originally expected. Consumer prices rose further in February. The underlying inflation rate, however, which is calculated after stripping out non-cereal agricultural products and petroleum-based products from the CPI, remained subdued. The financial markets are showing a relatively stable range of movements. Despite the increase in the target level for the overnight call rate in February, long-term market rates have declined slightly as the bond market trading has become brisk following the clearing up of uncertainties over the redemption of funds from investment trust companies(ITCs). Taking these factors into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea has decided that the overnight call rate will be maintained at around its current level in March. In the meantime, given that imports are rising rapidly due to demand pressures from the continued expansion of the real economy and that wage increases are accelerating, a more careful watch should be kept on the possible future emergence of internal and/or external imbalances."
Chile,2000-03-16,"Santiago. March 16, 2000 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank analyzed the evolution of the economy in recent weeks and the outlook for the next 8 quarters. Going on figures available since the previous meeting in February, the new conditions in international fuel markets have been incorporated into this analysis and now it seems that the drop in prices might not be so much or so fast as had been foreseen. Apart from the direct effects, this heightens the risk of pressures passing through to domestic inflation, particularly during this year, although external pressure should be transitory. On the other hand, the slow growth of domestic demand is an important factor in forecasting lower inflation next year despite the cost pressures already mentioned. Nevertheless, these cost pressures present a threat to achieving the medium-term inflationary target because they could feed expectations of higher inflation that the Central Bank must ensure are not materialized. In order to avoid cost pressures unnecessarily prolonging their effect on inflation, the Board decided to slightly raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points from UF plus 5.25% to UF plus 5.5% and the liquidity credit lines by the same amount. The Board points out that this slight change brings the interest rate to a more neutral position, coherent with the expected recovery of domestic demand in the coming quarters. In this way, the slight economic impulse produced by monetary policy ought not to add to the already existing pressures coming from costs. The Board also points out that, in its analysis, announcements of an austere fiscal policy were considered to be important since such austerity would be an essential factor contributing to the adequate recovery of investment and private consumption by way of a more healthy combination between fiscal and monetary policy in the future. In this context, it adds that there are no reasons at the moment for the monetary policy rate to be raised again."
Israel,2000-03-27,"March 27, 2000 Monetary program for April 2000 The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for April 2000 today, according to which its interest ratewill be reduced by 0.3 percentage points. The Bank of Israel pointed out that this reduction is consistent with attaining the government's inflation targetof an annual rate of 3 - 4 percent for the years 2000 and 2001, and hence, together with previous interest-rate reductions implemented in view of the consolidation of the path of expected inflation in the next one and two years, is consistent with the attainment of that target. The Bank of Israel pointed out that this interest-rate reduction also supports attaining the government's other targets, without jeopardizing the attainment of the inflation target. The Bank of Israel stressed that attaining the government's inflation target, in the framework of striving for price stability over time, creates the infrastructure necessary for sustainable growth. The Bank of Israel also explained that the decision as to changing the rate of change of the interest rate-which is decided each month in accordance with the changing circumstances in the field of assessing expected inflation for the coming one- and two-year periods-reflects several developments this month which implyuncertainty regarding inflation. The Bank of Israel noted in thiscontext the rapidly declining trend of the interest-rate spreadbetween Israel and abroad-against the backdrop of the persistent rise in the dollar interest rate and decline in local-currencyinterest-and its implications for capital flows and the management of thepublic's portfolio of assets and liabilities, as well as for Israel's financial markets. The Bank of Israel pointed out that the dollar interest rate is the main substitute for local-currency interest, in view of the current currency composition of the foreign-currency assets and liabilities held by the public and of capital flows to and from Israel. In addition, the money supply grew rapidly in the last year-beyondthe rate that is consistent with the government's inflation target, there has been an ongoing change for several months in the composition of unindexed local-currency deposits (reflected in the falling share of long-term deposits and parallel rise in that of short-term deposits), and questions have arisen regarding the stability of the foreign-currency market. The Bank of Israel repeated that the assessment regarding expected inflation for the next one- and two-year periods-which constitutes the basis for interest-rate decisions-rests primarily on the analysis of various long-term economic developments rather than on data for a given month, including the last one. The monthly data themselves do not constitute an adequate basis for assessing inflation for the horizon that is relevant for the government's target, or for making the monthly interest-rate policy decision aimedat attaining that target.

Euroarea,2000-03-30,"Ladies and gentlemen, today, the Governing Council of the ECB met for the first time outside Frankfurt. Therefore, let me first of all thank our host. Governor Rojo, for inviting us to meet in Madrid and for the generous hospitality offered to us. The Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. I should like to take the opportunity of this special meeting to take stock of where we stand 15 months after the start of Monetary Union. In January 1999 the euro was successfully launched as the single currency for 11 Member States of the EU. As a result of very careful conceptual and technical preparations, both the monetary policy-making process and the implementation of monetary policy have functioned efficiently right from the start. The challenges involved in setting up a central bank for a currency area as large as the euro area have been enormous. The Eurosystem - which comprises the European Central Bank and the 11 national central banks of the countries which have adopted the euro - has met these challenges with success. This would not have been possible without a strong willingness to co-operate on the part of the actors involved. I should like to take this opportunity once again to thank all the members of the Governing Council and the staff of the Eurosystem for this. From the start, we had extremely productive and open discussions in the Governing Council on monetary policy issues. In this respect, our monetary policy strategy has provided a very useful framework within which to organise our thinking. In our discussions there has always been a clear understanding, based on the Treaty, that the single monetary policy can only focus on maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole. This is based on the simple fact that in a monetary union, there is only one monetary policy, and this must be directed to a single objective. As laid down in the Treaty, each member of the Governing Council is therefore well aware that he or she is not a representative of a country or central bank but acts in a personal capacity in deciding the appropriate conduct of monetary policy for the euro area as a whole. The move to the single currency and the introduction of the euro were based on a degree of convergence towards price stability in participating countries that few observers would have predicted some years ago. In 1999 the average rate of consumer price increases in the euro area as a whole was among the lowest recorded since the Second World War and, at 1.1%, remained fully consistent with price stability. At the same time. Monetary Union does not mean perfect identity of economic conditions in all parts of the euro area. The experience of all larger currency areas shows that some differences in regional price developments and also in regional output growth may exist. As differences in national or regional developments cannot be addressed by the Eurosystem, they require, whenever necessary, country-specific responses. This means, in particular, responsible national wage settlements and appropriate national fiscal policies aimed at counteracting specific national problems. In addition, reforms addressing rigidities in labour and product markets and aiming at enhancing labour and capital mobility are the tools to ensure that market mechanisms will play an increasingly important role in limiting the scope for divergent developments in the euro area. The single monetary policy offers a great opportunity to maintain price stability in the euro area and to create the conditions needed for sustained economic growth. Currently, the prospects for strong economic growth in the euro area are very favourable - indeed, more favourable than they have been for many years. Economic activity in the euro area strengthened markedly in the second half of 1999 and this upswing is expected to continue through 2000 and beyond. Available forecasts point to real GDP growth of slightly over 3% in 2000 and 2001, reflecting both the favourable external environment and strong domestic demand. In line with this positive outlook, employment is expected to increase further and unemployment to come down in this context. At this juncture, it remains, indeed, important that the expected improvements in economic conditions and labour market prospects are not jeopardised by inappropriate wage settlements. In fact, wage moderation, combined with structural reforms in the labour markets, would help both to contain inflation in the euro area and to lead to further progress with employment creation. The contribution of monetary policy to strong and sustained economic growth is to ensure that price stability in the euro area will be maintained in the years to come. The Governing Council has, over recent months, raised ECB interest rates in three steps, in total by 1 percentage point, as a response to signals from both pillars of the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy that upward risks to price stability were increasing. Since the last meeting of the Governing Council, which was held on 16 March 2000, the main new data released relate to monetary developments and HICP inflation in the euro area. With regard to monetary developments, the annual growth rate of M3 in February 2000 was 6.2%, implying a small increase in the three-month moving average of annual M3 growth, to 5.9% for the period from December 1999 to February 2000. The annual rate of change in the HICP in the euro area rose from 1.9% in January 2000 to 2.0% in February 2000, reflecting the anticipated upward pressure on consumer prices stemming from oil price and exchange rate developments. In its review of the economic and monetary situation, the Governing Council also considered the recent developments in the exchange rate of the euro. Such developments need to be carefully assessed in the framework of the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy. The Governing Council regards the present level of the euro as not reflecting the significant recent improvements in the outlook for the euro area economy. At today's meeting the Governing Council decided to leave ECB interest rates unchanged. We shall, however, continue to be vigilant in order to be in a position, if needed, to counter inflationary pressure in a timely manner. There remain, however, also challenges for other economic policies in the euro area. As regards fiscal policies, the current upswing provides, for many countries, a good opportunity to comply more quickly with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact. This will free up resources for private initiatives and will, over time, contribute to increasing the growth potential of the euro area. At this juncture, probably the greatest challenge for the euro area lies in speeding up structural reform in order to reduce the high level of structural unemployment. In this respect, the Eurosystem strongly supports the conclusions of the European Council in Lisbon and calls for their timely implementation. Furthering structural reform is the key to a lasting process of job creation and a sustained period of strong economic expansion. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to present some of the additional topics discussed today by the Governing Council. I should like to draw your attention to the following two items: first, the international financial architecture, an issue which was discussed in preparation for the forthcoming IMF Spring Meetings in Washington. D.C., and, second, the ECB's information campaign for the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. Let me start with the Governing Council's deliberations in relation to the current discussion on the international financial architecture, for which the President was mandated to convey the Governing Council's views to the President of the ECOFIN Council. Through its representation in all-relevant international institutions and fora, the Eurosystem has been able to participate actively in ongoing discussions over the past year. The Eurosystem actively supports those efforts made by various institutions and fora - such as the IMF, the World Bank, the Financial Stability Forum and the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision - to enhance transparency and to improve the soundness both of financial systems and of regulatory and supervisory frameworks. Owing to the fact that unsustainable exchange rate regimes were a factor behind financial crises of previous years, recent discussions have focused in particular on the choice of appropriate exchange rate arrangements. The Governing Council is of the view that such a choice should not be confined to alternative solutions of either a hard peg or free floating. Intermediate regimes, such as adjustable pegs, may suit the needs of emerging market economies, depending on their specific domestic and external conditions. Refocusing the role of the IMF has been central to most recent reform proposals. The Governing Council is of the view that strengthening the key responsibilities of the IMF, namely further enhancing its credibility as a policy adviser and provider of financial assistance to members facing a loss of market confidence, will make an important contribution to international monetary stability. As regards crisis management, the Eurosystem is looking forward to seeing further progress in the complex but crucial area of ensuring private sector involvement in crisis prevention and resolution. Second, the Governing Council approved the overall framework for the EURO 2002 information campaign - a Europe-wide campaign intended to familiarise citizens with the euro banknotes and coins. to recognise the euro banknotes and coins and, in particular, their security features,. to familiarise themselves with the different (and, in many cases, new) denominations of the euro banknotes and coins, and. to inform themselves about the means by which the euro banknotes and coins will be introduced on 1 January 2002. The strategy behind the ECB's campaign is based on the concept of co-operation with ""multipliers"", such as banks, retailers and their associations, as well as educational institutions and governmental authorities, at both a European and a national level. In the first phase, which is about to start, the ""multipliers"" will be approached in order to prepare their own activities with regard to training and the provision of information. In the second phase, scheduled for the second half of 2001, the general public will actively be informed by means of a centralised mass media campaign to ensure the smooth changeover to the euro banknotes and coins. The main communication tools will be television spots and widely distributed printed matter supported by radio spots and both billboard and press advertisements. I should like to stress that due account will be taken of the specific needs of the various groups of vulnerable citizens in the conduct of the campaign. Close co-ordination with the EU institutions and the Member States will ensure the provision of consistent information."
South Korea,2000-04-06,"While the real economy has continued to grow rapidly, the current account surplus has been narrowing fast. Latent inflationary pressures, however, have not yet materialized. For the first quarter of this year, consumer prices and the core inflation rose 1., 5 percent and 0., 8 percent respectively, compared with the same period of last year. In the financial markets, despite ample liquidity, transactions of long- term bonds were still inactive and thus there has been no clear improvement in the concentration of funds at the short-term end of the market. Reflecting this situation, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea has decided that the overnight call rate would be maintained at around its current level in April. The Committee also noted that it was necessary to be on the alert against the possible future emergence of internal and/or external imbalances and to be ready to take action, keeping a careful eye on the movements in the real and financial sectors."
South Africa,2000-04-06,"The Monetary Policy Committee discussed in some detail recent international and domestic economic developments and the current monetary policy stance. The main conclusions of the Committee are summarised in this statement. Information available about economic activity in the current year, indicates a continuation of the broad-based economic recovery of the second half of 1999. Export growth remained healthy and world prices of internationally traded primary commodities rose strongly in the first three months of 2000. Domestic non-gold mining output remained at a high level, manufacturing output growth maintained momentum and the rate of increase in motor car sales accelerated in the first few months of 2000. Bond prices were more volatile in a market with record turnovers. Yields generally shifted upwards in the first three months of 2000 because of a shift of funds away from commodity-based countries to high-tech and manufacturing orientated economies. Moreover, sustained buoyant market conditions in the United States contributed to this shift in funds. As a consequence, non-residents were net sellers of bonds to the amount of R5,6 billion in the first three months of 2000. These developments in interest rates were reflected in a change in the shape of the yield curve. The upward-sloping short end of the yield curve steepened slightly, partly as a result of a shortage of suitable liquid assets which the banks could hold for prudential purposes. The longer end of the yield curve shifted parallel upwards based on higher inflation expectations, international increases in longer-term interest rates and large net sales of South African bonds by non-residents. 2.4 The two elements of financial stability, i.e. price stability and the stability of the financial sector, are closely related. Failure to maintain one of these elements provides an uncertain operating environment for the other, with causality running in both directions. For example, high inflation could lead to tighter monetary policy, higher interest rates, an increase in the non-performing loans of banks and a fall in asset and collateral values, which could precipitate bank and other failures in the financial sector. Conversely, disruptions in the financial system will make the transmission of monetary policy less effective and could materially affect changes in the general price level. 2.5 Financial stability is not an end in itself, but is regarded as an important precondition for sustainable high growth and employment creation. By establishing and maintaining financial stability the monetary authorities make their unique contribution to general economic development in South Africa. If financial institutions and markets are uncertain or unstable it is difficult to produce, consume and invest, and therefore to increase employment. The recent emerging-market financial crisis in 1997 and 1998 has also clearly illustrated that foreign investment can be withdrawn easily and in large amounts from countries that investors perceive as high-risk destinations. Moreover, it is difficult for a country with a high rate of inflation to remain competitive in a global environment where more and more countries have already successfully reduced inflation to low levels. 2.6 Inflation has many other disadvantages, such as:. monitors the financial risks of banks and supports the development of sound and well-managed banking institutions; and. making the objective of monetary policy clear and thereby improve planning in the private and public sectors;. helping to focus monetary policy and enhances the accountability of the central bank to the public; and. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the growth prospects for the world economy have remained positive. The unexpectedly high annualised growth of around 7 per cent in the real gross domestic product of the United States in the fourth quarter of 1999 resulted in a further increase in official interest rates during March. Continued upward pressure on official interest rates is likely to remain the norm as US policy-makers seek to dampen inflationary pressures. The growth performance in the Euro area has been robust and is expected to improve further over the current year. Inflationary pressures induced by higher oil prices and a weaker euro exchange rate brought about a further interest rate increase by the European Central Bank. In contrast to these developments, the Bank of England did not raise its rates in March. In Japan interest rates are being maintained at exceptionally low levels in view of the fact that the country is experiencing negative growth and deflationary tendencies. There are, however, promising signs that the Japanese economy could start recovering during the current year. Economic growth prospects in the developing countries in Africa and Latin America remain good, but growth in Asia slowed down during the second half of 1999. Growth in the aggregate production of the developing countries in Asia is nevertheless expected to average a high rate of 6 per cent in 2000. Inflationary pressures in Africa. Latin America and in the countries in transition seem to be subsiding or remaining constant. The pressure on world inflation induced by higher oil prices was reduced somewhat by the decision of OPEC in March to relax production quotas. This had the effect of reducing oil prices from above US$30 to around US$24 per barrel. The gold price weakened in March and averaged US$286,56 per fine ounce for the month. On 6 April the gold price stood at US$278,85. Despite these indications of economic recovery, there were still no signs of any pick-up in the formal demand for labour by the end of 1999. According to the Survey of Total Employment and Earnings by Statistics South Africa, there was a loss of more than 43 000 jobs in the formal non-agricultural sectors of the economy in the last quarter of 1999. The Monetary Policy Committee is concerned about the high unemployment in South Africa, but remains convinced that the best contribution that monetary policy can make in creating an environment conducive to economic development and employment creation is bringing about and maintaining financial stability. The underutilisation of labour resources apparently slowed down the growth in the earnings of workers during 1999. The year-on-year growth in nominal salaries and wages per worker declined sharply from 7,1 per cent in the first quarter to 3,9 per cent in the fourth quarter of that year. This decline together with productivity increases caused the change in nominal unit labour costs measured over a period of twelve months to turn around from a positive rate of 5,5 per cent in the first quarter of 1999 to a negative rate of 0,7 per cent in the fourth quarter. On average, nominal unit labour costs increased at a rate of 3,5 per cent in 1999. The slowdown in the growth of labour costs has been neutralised by other price increases. Rising costs of imported crude oil, increases in the prices of transport equipment and increases in food prices partly related to the recent floods, caused an upward movement in production prices. The rate of increase in the overall consumer price index in metropolitan and other urban areas, excluding mortgage bond costs, rose from 6,5 per cent in October 1999 to 7,1 per cent in February 2000. The twelve-month growth in the broadly defined money supply (M3) accelerated from single-digit levels during 1999 to 10,2 per cent in January and 13,9 per cent in February 2000. The latter rate was, however, influenced by an exceptionally low base value in the previous year. In contrast, the seasonally adjusted month-to-month growth in M3 was subdued in the first two months of 2000, following brisk rates of expansion in the second half of 1999. Total domestic credit extension continued to expand firmly in the first two months of 2000. The growth rate in this aggregate measured over twelve months accelerated from 6,9 per cent in October 1999 to 11,5 per cent in February 2000. Although the growth in credit extension to the private sector weakened in February, its lack of buoyancy was countered by an increase in the net claims on the government sector by the monetary institutions. Early indications are that conditions in the real-estate market strengthened further in the first quarter of 2000, with increases in property prices and rental values being recorded. Share market turnovers also remained at a high level, but share prices declined somewhat. From an all-time high on 17 January 2000, share prices declined by 17 per cent until 13 March. Subsequently they regained some lost ground, rising by 7,5 per cent until 27 March 2000, but then declined again by 6,1 per cent until 5 April. Money market interest rates remained more or less unchanged since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. The stable money market rates were related to the daily liquidity requirement of banks which was managed in a way to ensure that the repo rate would remain at or around the level of 11,75 per cent. Through various operational procedures the Reserve Bank steered the daily liquidity requirement to a level of between R7 billion and R8 billion during March and the beginning of April, and continued to provide fully in the estimated liquidity requirements at the daily repo auctions. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET. The good export performance in the first two months of 2000 neutralised the effect of the rise in oil prices and increases in the volume of imports. As a consequence, the trade balance in the first two months of 2000 was in surplus. The seasonally adjusted and annualised average monthly value of the surplus amounted to R23,1 billion in January and February 2000, compared with R20,0 billion in the fourth quarter of 1999. This indicates that the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments could have declined somewhat, provided there was no significant increase in net service and transfer payments to the rest of the world. Judging by the net sales of fixed-interest securities and equities by non-residents in the domestic capital markets, there is a strong possibility that the external financial account deteriorated in the first three months of 2000. The gross gold and other foreign reserves of the Reserve Bank accordingly increased by just R3,1 billion from the end of December 1999 to the end of March 2000; in the fourth quarter of 1999 an increase of R6,2 billion was recorded. Despite this slowdown in the increase in foreign reserves, the net open foreign currency position of the Reserve Bank declined by US$1,9 billion in the first three months of 2000 to a level of US$10,3 billion at the end of March, owing largely to the proceeds of a US$750 million bond issue by the government. The external value of the rand against both the US dollar and a basket of currencies continued to decline during March. After stabilising around R6,30 to the US dollar in February, the rand depreciated to an average level of R6,45 in March. At the beginning of April the rand along with other emerging-market currencies came under pressure and depreciated further to R6,60 against the dollar on 5 April 2000. Against a basket of currencies, the rand fell by some 3,8 per cent from the end of 1999 to 5 April 2000. International stock exchanges and exchange rates have been more volatile in recent weeks. For example, the euro depreciated to all time low levels against the US dollar, the Australian dollar has depreciated by more against the US dollar than the rand and the NASDAQ composite index weakened by 16 per cent in just 8 days. The recent net sales of South African securities by non-residents were accommodated in an orderly fashion. The South African markets have reacted in a mature manner to these changes, thereby avoiding large price swings while reflecting underlying market conditions. Conditions in the banking sector remained stable during the first three months of 2000. Profitability was healthy, but the margin between interest rates paid on loans and advances and the funding of the banking sector declined from 3,92 percentage points in December 1999 to 3,37 percentage points in February 2000. The anticipated short-term liquidity mismatch, i.e. the difference between liabilities maturing in the next 31 days and assets maturing during the same period, decreased from 14,0 per cent of total liabilities in December 1999 to 12,6 per cent in February 2000. Recent changes in price indices continued to reflect some inflationary pressures in the South African economy. The secondary effects of oil price increases, rising food prices and a projected increase in domestic demand during 2000, are expected to result in higher inflationary pressures over the short term. The twelve-month growth in money supply also accelerated in the second half of 1999 and reached relatively high levels in the first two months of 2000. However, the high year-on-year growth of money supply in February 2000 was mainly due to technical factors. The month-on-month increases in money supply in the first two months of 2000 actually slowed down significantly. The oil and food price increases are the result of particular events that are not expected to have a permanent effect on the inflation rate. In fact, the oil price started to decline in late March because of a decision by OPEC to increase production by 1,7 million barrels per day. Over the medium to longer term the outlook for inflation still seems to be very promising. In particular, the recent subdued movements in nominal unit labour cost should have a dampening effect on general price increases. Fiscal discipline continues to be applied, and the public sector borrowing requirement, i.e. the deficit before borrowing of the central government, provincial governments, local authorities, non-financial public enterprises and public corporations, averaged 1,7 per cent of gross domestic product in the first nine months of fiscal 1999/2000. Prudent monetary discipline will continue to be pursued. Moreover, there is still excess production capacity in the economy. These factors should, over the medium term, contain inflationary pressures. In view of the above circumstances the Monetary Policy Committee has decided that the current level of the repurchase rate of the Reserve Bank should be maintained. There still seems to be uncertainty about the application of inflation targeting in South Africa despite the explanations given by the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank. The Monetary Policy Committee therefore decided to append to this statement a more detailed explanation of the new monetary policy framework. Statement issued by Mr T T. Mboweni,. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. 1.1 On 23 February 2000 the Minister of Finance announced in the Budget Speech that the government had decided to set an inflation target range of 3 to 6 per cent for the year 2002. The Reserve Bank has therefore formally adopted an inflation- targeting monetary policy framework. This means that the monetary authorities are now targeting the rate of inflation directly instead of following the previously applied ""eclectic"" monetary policy approach in which intermediate objectives still played a prominent role. In this statement the new monetary policy framework is explained in more detail. 2.1 The primary objective of monetary policy is to protect the value of the currency in order to obtain balanced and sustainable economic growth in the country. This objective is articulated in both the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa and in the South African Reserve Bank Act. No 90 of 1989. It requires the achievement of financial stability, i.e. price stability as well as stable conditions in the financial sector as a whole. 2.2 Price stability is achieved when changes in the general price level do not materially affect the economic decision-making processes. Although relative price movements will still have an impact on production, consumption, saving and investment, the rate of inflation or deflation would be so low that it would no longer be an important factor in economic decision making. 2.3 Stable conditions in the financial sector are achieved when there is a high degree of confidence that the financial institutions and financial markets are able to meet contractual obligations without interruption or recourse to outside assistance. Such stable conditions do not preclude the failure of individual financial institutions. A financial institution can fail and be allowed to fail even under stable financial conditions. It is only when the whole, or an important part, of the financial sector is at risk, that the situation can be described as financially unstable. distorting the allocation of resources and often directs the efforts of entrepreneurs and investors into hedging operations instead of productive activity;. discouraging saving: people spend money now rather than save for investment and future consumption if the expected value is much less;. discriminating against fixed salaried workers, pensioners and low-income earners who cannot protect themselves against the impact of inflation; and. usually leading to an even more unequal distribution of income and wealth. 2.7 The new inflation-targeting monetary policy framework is primarily concerned with one element of financial stability, i.e. price stability. For overall financial stability it is important that the Reserve Bank:. ensures the availability of high quality currency in circulation in various denominations to serve as a reliable means to execute financial transactions in the economy;. facilitates the development and maintenance of an efficient national payment, clearing and settlement system;. encourages the development and efficient functioning of the money, capital and foreign exchange markets;. where appropriate acts as lender-of-last-resort assistance providing assistance to solvent banks to safeguard the system from systemic risks arising from temporary liquidity shortages. 3.1 The government decided to set an inflation target as part of a new approach to monetary policy and price stabilisation because of certain advantages that such a framework is expected to have, such as:. forming part of a formalised co-ordinated effort to contain inflation in pursuit of the broader economic objective of sustainable high economic growth and employment creation;. providing an anchor for expectations of future inflation which should influence price and wage setting. 3.2 Inflation targeting is a monetary policy framework characterised by an announcement of a numerical target for the inflation rate that is intended to be achieved over a specific time period. In this definition it is important to note that inflation targeting is a framework not a rule, that the numerical rate is made public and that a definite time horizon is specified. 3.3 Although the achievement of the target becomes the overriding objective of monetary policy in an inflation-targeting framework, the adoption of the new framework does not mean that the central bank must apply rigid rules and is left without any discretion. Exclusive emphasis on inflation goals without a careful analysis of economic conditions can lead to serious distortions in the economy which could result in higher inflation over the long term. A rigorously applied rule deprives the central bank of its ability to deal with unusual or unforeseen circumstances."
Chile,2000-04-11,"Santiago. April 11, 2000 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank analyzed the recent evolution of the economy and the outlook for the next 24 months. This analysis indicates that following the slight monetary policy interest rate rise on March 16, the threats to inflation have diminished. In particular, international fuel prices have gone down which means that further increases of related domestic price are less likely. Moreover, the exchange rate is going down which should also contribute to other prices not increasing. In addition, the market has welcomed the commitment to greater fiscal austerity and the preventive rises in monetary policy interest rate in January and March so inflationary expectations remain in line with the medium-term target set by the Bank. Domestic demand continues to recover slowly, as does economic activity in general. In view of the expected evolution of these variables, based on available information, it is possible to foresee the gap between effective and potential output closing gradually. This allows a forecast of trend inflation over 12 to 24 months in the range of 2% to 4% and centering on an annual 3%, defined as the target. On these grounds, the Board decided to leave the monetary policy interest rate at its current level of UF plus 5.5% and also leave the liquidity credit lines unchanged."
Euroarea,2000-04-13,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council today conducted its regular examination of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area. Following this review, the Governing Council decided to maintain the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem at 3.5% and to keep the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and on the deposit facility at 4.5% and 2.5% respectively. Allow me to give you an overview of the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary, financial market and other economic developments. Let me start with information in relation to the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy. No new monetary data have been released since the last meeting of the Governing Council, which was held in Madrid on 30 March 2000. This implied a small increase in the three-month moving average of annual M3 growth, to 5.9%, from 5.8% recorded for the three-month period from November 1999 to January 2000. M3 growth thus remained around 1 1/2 percentage points above the reference value of 4 1/2%. The picture of generous liquidity conditions in the euro area is also confirmed by the continued strong annual rate of growth of loans to the private sector, which stood at 10.5% in February. With regard to economic developments in the euro area, following strong growth of real GDP in the second half of 1999, most recent production and survey data suggest that the economic expansion also remained strong in early 2000. In particular, both consumer and industrial confidence have now reached levels which are close to the highest observed since the mid-1980s. This picture of strong growth of domestic demand supports the favourable outlook for economic growth in the euro area as depicted in recent forecasts. The positive prospects for euro area activity also benefit from the strong cyclical upswing in the world economy, which has become more broadly based across industrial and emerging economies and which is expected to continue in the years to come. The exchange rate of the euro does not reflect the ongoing improvement in domestic fundamentals in the euro area economy. In nominal effective terms, the euro was around 4% lower in mid-April than at the beginning of the year and approximately 14% below its level in the first quarter of last year. Until reversed, this development will put upward pressure on import prices and will continue to affect the risks for price stability in the euro area. As I have already noted on previous occasions, the rise in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) which we have observed over recent months stems, to a large extent, from the combined effects of both oil price and exchange rate developments. The annual rate of change in the HICP rose to 2.0% in February 2000, from 1.9% in the previous month. The rate of inflation on producer prices also rose further in February 2000, mainly in connection with rising prices for intermediate goods. This has been in line with the assumption underlying currently available economic forecasts, namely that the oil price increases which we observed until March will partially unwind in the course of the year. At the same time, it is most likely that the complete upward impact on consumer prices via import and producer prices of the oil price and exchange rate developments in recent months has not yet materialised. Against this background, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the figure for annual HICP inflation will slightly exceed 2% in the spring of this year, before falling back to lower levels. What matters for monetary policy, however, are the trends underlying the outlook for price stability in the medium term. In this context, the Governing Council again stressed the need for the continuation of wage moderation in the euro area. As noted earlier, monetary and credit developments confirm that liquidity in the euro area is ample. Developments in the exchange rate of the euro also remain a cause for concern with regard to future price stability. In the light of the favourable prospects for strong economic growth, the impact of these developments on inflationary pressures will need to be monitored closely. The Eurosystem will remain vigilant in assessing upside risks to price stability and will take appropriate action if and when required. A forward-looking monetary policy which responds to risks to price stability before they materialise will avoid the need for a costly stabilisation of inflation at a later stage. Such a forward-looking approach is clearly also the best contribution monetary policy can make to ensuring the sustainability of the process of economic growth. This phase of economic growth in the euro area will offer a great opportunity to make further progress in bringing down the high level of unemployment in the euro area. An important means of achieving this will be continued wage moderation, which, in turn, will also help to contain inflationary pressure. This notwithstanding, as I have stressed repeatedly in the past, the key to achieving a sustainable reduction in the level of unemployment will be structural reforms in the euro area, including a lowering of the tax burden and an improvement in the fiscal expenditure structure. Only when labour markets are more flexible and competitive pressures are high will it be possible to prevent bottlenecks from triggering upward pressures on prices at a relatively early stage of an economic recovery. The favourable economic prospects will lead to higher tax revenues. In line with the Stability and Growth Pact, it is not opportune to use these extra revenues for higher spending. Now is the time to speed up fiscal consolidation in order to help to reduce further the debt-to-GDP ratios in the Community and to approach more quickly fiscal budgetary positions in surplus or balance. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to present some of the additional topics discussed today by the Governing Council. I should like to draw your attention to two items: the first reflects the Eurosystem's growing involvement in the EU accession process and relates to the Governing Council's position with regard to the appropriateness of euro-based currency board arrangements (CBAs) as a strategy to be used by accession countries with regard to adopting the euro; the second relates to a further enhancement of the ECB's transparency policy. Let me start with the Governing Council's deliberations on CBAs. We concluded that the appropriateness of CBAs will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, the Governing Council neither encourages nor discourages the adoption of euro-based CBAs. In any event, such arrangements cannot be regarded as a substitute for two years' participation in ERM II. Accession countries which have operated a euro-based CBA deemed to be sustainable might not be required to go through a double regime shift in their strategies to adopt the euro. Thus such countries may participate in ERM II with a CBA as a unilateral commitment augmenting the discipline within ERM II. However, it should be clearly understood that a common accord would have to be reached on the central parity against the euro. With a view to further enhancing the ECB's transparency policy, the Governing Council has today decided to publish all non-confidential legal instruments governing the relationship between the ECB and the euro area national central banks in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The release of these legal instruments in all 11 official Community languages will give interested members of the public an opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge about the internal operation of the Eurosystem. The members of the Governing Council regard the transparency of the decision-making process as an appropriate means by which to strengthen the democratic nature of the institution and to increase the public's confidence in its administration. This decision is in line with the general policy towards increased transparency in the decision-making process currently being pursued at the Community level."
Israel,2000-04-24,"April 24, 2000 Monetary program for May 2000 The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for May 2000 today, according to which its interest rate will be reduced by 0.3 percentage points. The Bank of Israel noted that this reduction of theinterest rate is consistent with attaining the government's inflation target ofan annual rate of 3 - 4 percent for the years 2000 and 2001, and hence alsosupports attaining the government's other targets, without jeopardizing the attainment of the inflation target. The Bank of Israel stressed that attaining the government's inflation target, within the framework of striving for price stability over time, creates the infrastructure necessary for sustainable growth. The Bank also noted that there are dangers in the area of inflation that areinfluenced inter alia by the rapidly declining trend of the interest-rate spreadbetween Israel and abroad-against the backdrop of the reduction of local-currency interest and rise in dollar interest-and its implications for capital flows and the management of the public's assets and liabilities portfolio, and thus on Israel's financial markets. The Bank of Israel pointed out in this context that the dollar interest rate is the main substitute for the local-currency interest rate in view of the current currency composition of the foreign-currency assets and liabilities held by the public, as well as of capital flows to and from Israel. The Bank of Israel noted that while recent developments in international capital markets-especially in the U.S.-increase uncertainty and the level of financial risk in the securities and foreign-currency markets, they do not at present have implications for expected inflation inIsrael for the next one- and two-year periods, or for its direction-and hence for the policy required today in order to attain the government's inflation target. The Bank of Israel will continue, as in the past, to monitor these developments, primarily in order to analyze their implications for inflation and the economy. The Bank of Israel also explained that a significant part of the exceptional rise principally of current D 7A 3in the money supply (M 1) in the first quarter of 2000 because some of the commercial banks D 7A 3deposits, which constitute part of M 1 have begun to offer institutional investors (e.g., mutual and provident funds) current deposits bearing a daily interest-rate equivalent to that on SROs, which are not part of M 1. The Bank of Israel noted that the significant recent increase in the resort to this financial instrumentis connected primarily with the large deposits implemented by the public in thelocal-currency mutual funds-which direct daily balances from the money accrued in them to these deposits. The banks' reports to the Bank of Israel on current deposits have not noted this component to date, and the Bank of Israel has made preparations for obtaining reports which will make it possible to publish an approximation of current developments in M 1, without these deposits. The Bank of Israel repeated that the assessment regarding expected inflation for the next one- and two-year periods-which constitutes the basis for interest-rate decisions-relies mainly on an analysis of the various economic developments and their long-term implications. Datasuch as the Consumer Price Index, exchange-rate shifts, fluctuations in the capital markets, and inflation expectations-which are correct for a given week or month, including the most recent one, and certainly for several retroactively-are not a sufficient basis for assessing inflation for the coming year or two, and hence are not relevant for monthly decisions regarding the interest-rate policy, unless they embody clear repercussions for the path of inflation for the coming year or two.

South Korea,2000-05-04,"Although the current account surplus has been narrowing faster than expected due to a sharp surge in imports corresponding to the continued rapid growth, inflationary pressure has not yet materialized as is evidenced by the month-on-month decline in consumer prices in April. In the financial markets, while overall liquidity has increased significantly, the concentration of funds at the short-term end of the market has persisted. Despite ample liquidity, however, the uncertainties induced recently by the problems related to the ailing investment trust companies(ITCs) remain as latent factors with the potential to destabilize the financial markets. Reflecting such real and financial sector situations, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea has decided that the overnight call rate would be maintained at around its current level in May. In the meantime, the MPC noted that it would remain well-prepared to take monetary policy actions in order to manage aggregate demand while keeping a close eye on the economic developments, since the chances were growing that the internal and/or external imbalances would emerge in the future. Along with this, it also noted that it was essential to establish a clear-cut plan for the restructuring of the troubled ITCs as soon as possible, which would serve to dispel market uncertainties."
Chile,2000-05-09,"Santiago. May 9, 2000 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at its current level of UF plus 5.5% and that liquidity credit lines would also remain unchanged. The Board analyzed recent economic developments and the outlook for the next 24 months in the light of available data. The Board considers that given a scenario of 6% economic growth a year for the next two years there is every likelihood of inflation stabilizing at around the middle of the target range, that is around 3% in a range of 2%-4% within 12 to 24 months. In the short term, inflation might exceed the upper limit of that range but underlying inflation would stand within the range. The path of inflation during these 24 months could be variable but the risks are essentially balanced for the relevant horizon and monetary policy will be vigilant and flexible enough to face such risks."
Euroarea,2000-05-11,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem was left at 3.75% and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were maintained at 4.75% and 2.75% respectively. Allow me to give you an overview of the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary, financial market and other economic developments. In March 2000 the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 - covering the period from January to March 2000 - rose to 6.0%, compared with 5.9% in the period from December 1999 to February 2000. Consequently. M3 growth remained 1 1/2 percentage points above the reference value of 4 1/2%. The annual rate of increase in credit to the private sector also rose, to 10.9%, compared with 10.4% in the previous month. These figures confirm our earlier assessment, namely that liquidity continued to be ample in the euro area in early 2000. As regards economic developments, recent information confirms the very positive outlook for strong growth in the euro area. All available indicators and forecasts seem to point to a phase of continued economic growth, following the upturn observed in the second half of 1999. Industrial production rebounded in February and this, together with further increases in capacity utilisation and industrial confidence up to April, suggests an ongoing strengthening in industrial activity. In addition, with consumer confidence remaining at an all-time high and unemployment continuing to decline, the recent strength of private consumption should be sustained. Looking at the world economy, the upturn in growth has become more broadly based, pertaining to both industrial and emerging economies, and most forecasts indicate that current growth differentials between economic areas are in the course of narrowing. Notwithstanding the strong growth performance and favourable outlook for euro area economic activity, the exchange rate of the euro has continued to decline over the past few weeks and has thereby moved further out of line with the increasingly positive economic fundamentals of the euro area, as well as international balance of payments positions. In March consumer price inflation, as measured by increases in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), rose to 2.1%, up from 2.0% in the previous month. This was due to developments in both oil prices and exchange rates. A moderation in 12-month inflation rates can be expected in the course of 2000, reflecting the decline in oil prices from around mid-March and base effects dampening the increase in inflation rates compared with the same month a year earlier. However, what matters for monetary policy are the trends underlying the outlook for price stability in the medium term. In this respect, the depreciation of the exchange rate of the euro, until it is reversed, will increase the risks to price stability in the medium term. These risks have to be taken seriously in the light of the current strong upswing. Other important factors which will have a crucial impact on the outlook for price stability over the medium term are a continuation of currently moderate wage developments, a further fiscal consolidation in line with the Stability and Growth Pact and the further implementation of structural reforms in product and labour markets. The Governing Council would like its message to be very clear: price stability in the euro area will be maintained and, as I already said last week, the citizens of Europe can be confident that their savings and pensions will keep their value over time. Price stability will help to turn the current upswing into a long period of high economic growth and falling unemployment, and it will strengthen the currency. Finally. I should like to inform you about two items related to the field of statistics. First, the Governing Council has decided in the near future to publish a comprehensive description of the statistical information collected and compiled by the ESCB, mainly in the areas of money and banking statistics, securities issues, interest rates, balance of payments and financial accounts, with pointers to possible developments in these areas. Second, the Governing Council has adopted a revised Guideline and a revised Recommendation on ""the statistical reporting requirements of the ECB in the field of balance of payments statistics, the international reserves template and international investment position statistics"". Both the Guideline and the Recommendation will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in due course."
South Africa,2000-05-19,"The Monetary Policy Committee meeting over two days made a detailed assessment of recent economic and financial market developments. The main conclusions of the Committee are summarised in this statement. International economic indicators that have become available since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee confirm that a strong recovery is taking place in the world economy. According to the latest forecast of the International Monetary Fund, world economic growth is projected to rise from 3,3 per cent in 1999 to 4,2 per cent in 2000. This is expected to be accompanied by a decline in world inflation, despite an acceleration in the average inflation rate of advanced economies. In the United States the first quarter growth rate amounted to a robust 5,4 per cent, the labour market remained tight, and rising labour costs fed through to higher inflation rates. The year-on-year consumer price inflation was in excess of 3 per cent in recent months, putting upward pressure on interest rates. On 16 May the Fed funds rate was therefore increased by a further 50 basis points to 6,5 per cent. The rising interest rates continue to attract significant capital flows into the United States, with a consequent loss of capital in other developed and developing economies. In addition, the volatility and generally downward tendency in United States share prices impacted negatively on other stock exchanges, particularly those in the emerging-market economies. Good growth prospects in the euro area did not prevent the euro from depreciating to record low levels against the dollar and sterling. The weaker euro, combined with strong credit demand, increased pressures on prices and caused the European Central Bank to raise its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points on four occasions since August 1999 to 3,75 per cent. On 11 May 2000 the Bank, however, decided to keep its rate unchanged. The Bank of England has maintained an unchanged repo rate since the beginning of February 2000, as the impact of the strong exchange rate is expected to offset inflation pressures emanating from domestic demand growth and the tight labour market. Deflationary conditions continued in Japan with further decreases in consumer prices in the beginning of 2000. Japanese credit demand is weak and businesses are reducing debts as part of balance-sheet restructuring. Economic growth prospects in Asia and Latin America remain good, although their stock markets were hit hard by the Wall Street correction. Inflation pressures in emerging-market economies have subsided. In the first few months of this year, economic conditions in Sub-Saharan Africa were influenced to a large extent by political events in some of these countries. Oil prices recorded a new six-week high on 19 May 2000 amid a combination of bullish fundamentals and speculative buying. Since the beginning of April, gold has traded within a range of $270 to $285 per fine ounce. Initial indications are that the growth in real gross domestic production seemed to have slowed down in the first quarter of 2000. This development in the economic recovery process occurred despite further growth in the tertiary sectors. Agricultural output probably declined and the growth of manufacturing production may have levelled off. Real domestic expenditure was affected by a decline in real consumption expenditure of general government, but nevertheless appears to have expanded further because of increases in household consumption expenditure, fixed capital formation and inventories. The Monetary Policy Committee noted the release of comprehensive labour statistics by Stats South Africa, which indicates that total employment rose over the period 1996 to 1998. Little new information on the labour market has become available which would give reason to believe that formal-sector employment increased in the first four months of 2000. The slowdown in the growth of labour costs during 1999 was neutralised by other price increases. As a result, the twelve-month rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas, excluding interest rates on mortgage bonds, (CPIX mu) continued to rise from 6,5 per cent in October 1999 to 7,8 per cent in April 2000. Rising oil and food prices were the main driving forces behind this acceleration in inflation. Measured from quarter to quarter, the annualised rate of increase in this index also rose from 6,4 per cent in the third quarter of 1999 to 8,7 per cent in the first quarter of 2000. The twelve-month rate of increase in the broadly defined money supply (M3) increased from a low of 5,5 per cent in August 1999 to 13,9 per cent in February 2000, before declining to 10,0 per cent in March. The quarter-to-quarter seasonally adjusted and annualised growth rate in M3 slowed down from 19,1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1999 to 10,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2000. The year-on-year growth in bank credit extended to the private sector receded from 9,6 per cent in January 2000 to 8,3 per cent in March. Mortgages, instalment sales and leasing finance picked up during the first quarter of 2000. In contrast to the pattern of the preceding three years, the increase in credit extension to the private sector in the first quarter of 2000 was concentrated in the household rather than the corporate sector. Financial market activity generally remained buoyant in the first 4½ months of 2000, but share market turnover per trading day receded somewhat in April and the first half of May. Share prices fell by 28 per cent from a peak on 17 January 2000 to a low on 17 April, but on balance strengthened again by 12 per cent up to 18 May. Prices and turnover in the property market firmed appreciably during the first quarter of 2000. Capital-raising activity in the primary capital markets was rather subdued in the first quarter of 2000, owing mainly to the substantial reduction in the public-sector borrowing requirement. The secondary market in bonds continued to suffer from selling pressures which started in mid-April. Regional events, adjustments in US security markets and higher international interest rates weighed heavily on the bond market and led to large net sales of securities by non-residents. Having been net investors in South African bonds to the amount of R16,5 billion from the beginning of 1999 until the end of January 2000, non-residents became net sellers and their sales totalled R17,0 billion up to 18 May 2000. Although these net sales by foreigners impacted negatively on bond yields, the weakening of approximately 115 basis points from the beginning of March was muted when compared with the magnitude of swings in bond yields over the past decade. The adverse developments in the bond market were reflected in a change of the shape of the yield curve. The level of the yield curve shifted higher across the full maturity spectrum, while a more pronounced upward movement at the longer end led to a steepening of the curve. Despite this upward movement in rates, the inflation-adjusted yield on long-term bonds rose only marginally. Money market rates remained stable throughout April, but moderate increases in the rates of some money market instruments, such as negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances and forward rate agreements became apparent in early May. Through operations such as foreign exchange swaps, reverse repurchase transactions and the issuing of debentures, the Reserve Bank steered the daily liquidity requirement of banks to a level of between R7,1 billion and R9,1 billion during April and the first half of May, and continued to provide fully in the estimated liquidity requirements at the daily repo auctions. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET. The overall balance of payments position remained healthy in the first quarter of 2000. Trade figures indicate that the current account deficit probably decreased somewhat. A substantial increase in the value of imports was offset by a strong export performance. The increase in exports was mainly the result of higher export values of mining and manufactured products. A decline in the volume of oil imports was neutralised by an increase in international oil prices, leaving the value of oil imports at more or less the level of the second half of 1999. The rise in imports during the first quarter of 2000 was mainly due to imports of manufactured goods. On the financial account of the balance of payments the already mentioned large net sales of bonds by non-residents were more than offset by net purchases of South African equities and other capital inflows. This enabled the Reserve Bank to reduce its net open foreign currency position by US$2,8 billion in the first four months of 2000 to a level of US$10,2 billion at the end of April. Despite the fundamentally sound overall balance of payments, the exchange rate of the rand together with currencies in Europe. Australia. New Zealand and a large number of emerging-market economies in Asia and Latin America, came under considerable pressure. From the beginning of the year the rand depreciated against the US dollar from a level of R6,15 to the dollar to more than R7,00 to the dollar from the first week of May 2000. The rand also depreciated somewhat against the United Kingdom pound and Japanese yen, but faired better against the euro. The weighted average value of the rand accordingly declined by about 7½ per cent from 31 December 1999 to 18 May 2000. This decline in the rand was largely related to the strength of the US dollar and perceptions about the effect of developments in some Sub-Saharan countries. Conditions in the banking sector remained stable during the first quarter of 2000. Improvements in the efficiency of banks and their short-term liquidity mismatch, slightly higher returns on assets and equities, as well as a lower dependency of banks on wholesale deposits for funding contributed to overall stability. In addition, total gross overdues of banks decreased from R29,2 billion in the fourth quarter of 1999 to R28,7 billion in the first quarter of 2000, or by 1,7 per cent. The quarterly decrease recorded in total overdues was evident in all three types of overdue accounts, i.e. in mortgages, instalment credit and other loans and advances. Provisioning by banks for bad and doubtful loans and advances remained adequate. Total provisions as a percentage of gross overdues rose from 58,6 per cent from the fourth quarter of 1999 to 60,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2000. International best practice suggests that the ratio of total provisions to total gross overdues of 40 per cent is adequate. The South African situation clearly indicates that our position is solid and sound. The problems experienced by FBC Fidelity Bank have been resolved in a manner that is good for both depositors and the banking sector as a whole. FBC Fidelity Bank was placed in curatorship in October 1999 when it experienced a liquidity crunch. Nedcor's takeover demonstrates that a bank can successfully be taken out of curatorship. The immediate upside risk for inflation in South Africa has increased as a result of the recent volatility in currency markets, the depreciation of the rand and a renewed increase in the oil price. The secondary effects of oil price increases, the higher rand values of imports and rising food prices during 2000, are expected to result in inflation pressures over the short term which will be monitored meticulously by the Reserve Bank. Domestic economic conditions, however, remain sound and indications are presently that the inflation rate will be in the targeted band as set for the year 2002. The recent depreciation of the rand despite a healthy overall balance of payments position, could be followed by a correction in the trade-weighted value of the rand over the coming months, especially if a reversal should occur in portfolio outflows. There are a number of other factors that bode well for the medium to longer-term outlook for inflation. These include amongst others relatively modest increases in nominal unit labour costs, the discipline applied by government in expenditure allocations and the progress made with revenue collections. The excess production capacity in the economy and modest growth in money supply and bank credit extension in the first quarter of 2000 are also very important. Moreover, a prudent monetary policy will continue to be pursued by the authorities in the coming months. If signs appear that stronger inflationary pressures are building up in the economy, the Reserve Bank will not hesitate to take appropriate measures. Taking all the above circumstances into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to maintain its current policy stance."
Israel,2000-05-29,"May 29, 2000 The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for June 2000, according to which its interest rate will remain unchanged. The Bank of Israel noted that the decision to leavethe nominal interest rate unchanged is consistent with the attainment of the government's inflation target of an annual rate of 3-4 percent for the years 2000 and 2001. The Bank of Israel again stressed that attaining the government's inflation target, within the framework of striving for price stability over time, creates the infrastructure necessary for sustained growth. The Bank explained that the decision regarding the rate of interest for June is based mainly on the convergence of expected inflation for a one- and two-year horizon with an environment consistent with the target of 3-4 percent a year. This contrasts with the developments in this area in recent months, when expected inflation and various inflation forecasts for one and two years forward were in an environment which appearedto be below that required to meet the inflation target. This background enabled the process of reducing the rate of interest in the last few months to take place. The Bank of Israel emphasized that there are dangers in the area of inflation that are influenced inter alia by the trend of a rapidly declining interest-rate gap between Israel and abroad, essentially between interest on local currency and that on the dollar (with dollar interest continuing to rise recently), and by the slowdown in the raising of capital in the US capital market by Israeli companies, in the light of the trend change in that market. These developments have implications for capital flows and for the management of the public's assets and liabilities portfolios, as well as for Israel's financial markets. The Bank of Israel again pointed out in this context that the public considers the dollar interest rate as the main substitute for the local-currency interest rate, and this is reflected in the current dollar share in the currency composition of the foreign-currency assets and liabilities held by the public, as well as of capital flows to and from Israel. The Bank added that activity in the domestic foreign-currency market is likely to be affected inter alia by assessments of the effects expected to result from the proposed reform of taxation of individuals. The reform includes changes some ofwhich may have long-term effects on the relative rate of return on investment in foreign-currency assets-financial and other- compared with that on investment in local-currency assets. The extent to which these factors persist over time, and the degree to which they do so, as well as the development of the money supply and of signs of recovery in real activity in the economy, all these constitute part of the assessment of whether the current nominal rate of interest is appropriate, also for the future, to the achievement of the inflation target. The Bank of Israel noted that the effect of interest-rate policy on the inflation path is not confined to the framework of a calendar year. Thus,decisions on the rate of interest are based on the assessment of expected inflation for the next year and two years-and not for the current or any other calendar year-an assessment derived mainly from an analysis of various economic developments and their long-term implications. The Bank stressed that these decisions on the rate of interest are aimed solely at achieving the inflation target determined by the government, and not at achieving any level of the NIS exchange rate or any change in it. Data such as the Consumer Price Index, changes in the exchange rate, fluctuations in the capital markets, and inflation expectations, for any particular week or month including the most recent one, and certainly for the last few months, do not per se provide a sufficient basis for assessing inflation for the next year or two. They are therefore not relevant to the monthly decisions on interest-rate policy, unless they haveclear repercussions on the inflation path for that period.

Chile,2000-06-08,"Santiago. June 8, 2000 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at its current level of UF plus 5.5% and that liquidity credit lines would also remain unchanged. As usual, the Board analyzed recent economic developments and the outlook for the next twenty-four months, based on May's Monetary Policy Report. Data gathered during recent months indicate that domestic demand, economic activity and employment are all following a path of moderate growth with no significant risk to price stability. This situation is confirmed by the favorable evolution of underlying inflation. On the external front, international financial markets continue highly volatile but news in the past few weeks confirms that the United States economy is gradually adjusting and that international interest rates should start to rise slowly. Finally, the most relevant change over the past month is that international fuel prices have risen more than what is reflected by domestic prices and if they continue to go up, domestic prices will also have to rise. All these considerations led the Board to leave the monetary policy interest rate unchanged. The Board reiterates its commitment to price stability, with inflation centering on 3% a year within a range of 2% to 4%. It will therefore maintain a flexible monetary policy stance in order to face any threats to achieving the inflation target."
Euroarea,2000-06-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meetings of the General Council and the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council took the following monetary policy decisions:. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be raised by 0.50 percentage point to 4.25% and applied in the two operations (which will be conducted as fixed rate tenders) to be settled on 15 and 21 June 2000. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be raised by 0.50 percentage point to 5.25%, with effect from 9 June 2000. The interest rate on the deposit facility will be raised by 0.50 percentage point to 3.25%, with effect from 9 June 2000. Starting from the operation to be settled on 28 June 2000, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be conducted as variable rate tenders, applying the multiple rate auction procedure. The Governing Council has decided to set a minimum bid rate for these operations equal to 4.25%. This is the same rate as that which will prevail for the two fixed rate tenders to be implemented following today's decision. Let me start by commenting on the reasons for this rise in interest rates, before the Vice-President says a few words about the move to a variable rate tender procedure. Over recent months the risks to price stability in the medium term have clearly continued to increase. This assessment has been supported by the information from both the first pillar and the second pillar of the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy. With regard to the first pillar, strong growth of money and credit throughout 1999 and the pronounced expansion of money and credit aggregates over the first four months of 2000 have strengthened the view that liquidity conditions are ample. As for the second pillar, in a phase of strong growth upward risks to price stability currently relate mainly to the spillover of rising import prices to consumer prices, owing both to the lagged effects of the exchange rate depreciation and to rising oil prices. In fact, most inflation forecasts have been revised upwards over recent months. Today's increase in ECB interest rates is a decisive step to address these upside risks to price stability and it will contribute to the continuation of non-inflationary growth in the euro area. Allow me to give you a more detailed overview of the main elements of our assessment of monetary, financial market and other economic developments. Let me start by addressing the latest monetary developments in the euro area. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, covering the period from February to April 2000, was 6.3%, i.e. significantly above the reference value of 4 1/2%. Thus, the most recent M3 data confirm that the liquidity situation in the euro area continues to be very generous. M3 growth deviated from the reference value in 1999 and growth rates increased further in early 2000. This picture of very generous liquidity conditions in the euro area is complemented by the rapid expansion of credit to the private sector, which remained close to or above 10% throughout 1999 and exceeded 11% in April 2000. Taken together, such developments would clearly point to upside risks to price stability over the medium term, if not counteracted in time. Turning to the second pillar, we have to consider economic and financial market developments as well as consumer price developments. Looking at economic developments, the outlook for growth in the euro area has improved markedly over the past few months. Overall, indicators for economic activity released since the end of last year point to continued strong growth, following the upturn in real GDP growth in the second half of 1999. All the forecasts currently available from major international organisations and private institutions now project real GDP growth to be above 3% this year and next year, which is significantly higher than expected at the end of last year. This positive outlook reflects favourable domestic and external conditions for growth. On the domestic side, expansion of private consumption and investment should benefit, in particular, from ongoing employment growth and higher rates of capacity utilisation. Domestic demand is also supported by high business and consumer confidence. On the external side, the upturn of growth in the world economy appears to be stronger, faster and more broadly based than was expected at the end of last year. Financial market developments also support the view that the economic expansion in the euro area is set to continue at a fast pace. Moreover, the exchange rate of the euro appreciated at the end of May and in the first few days of June, also reflecting expectations that robust economic growth will continue in the euro area. Notwithstanding the recent appreciation of the euro, the extent and duration of its previous depreciation will still exert upward pressure on consumer prices. Against this background, the outlook for consumer price developments had become less favourable prior to today's meeting. In April 2000 inflation - as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) - was 1.9%, following 2.1% in March. In the immediate future, the strong rise in oil prices in May 2000 is pointing to renewed short-term upward pressures. Looking further ahead, all available forecasts for consumer price inflation for this year and next are now higher than they were at the end of 1999. Current projections of a rate of inflation of around 2% in 2000 and 2001 are clear warning signals. In conclusion, with today's decisions the Governing Council has acted in a forward-looking manner in order to contribute to the maintenance of favourable conditions for a lasting, non-inflationary economic expansion. This should help other economic actors to rely firmly on the maintenance of price stability in the medium term. They are also called upon to contribute to price stability and growth by means of appropriate wage settlements compatible with employment growth, structural reform and fiscal consolidation. At the current juncture, they are especially encouraged to press ahead with structural reform, and governments are particularly urged to avoid a pro-cyclical loosening of fiscal policies. This is particularly important in those countries where there is a risk of overheating. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to say a few words about the decision to implement a variable rate tender procedure as from the main refinancing operation to be settled on 28 June 2000. The switch to variable rate tenders in the main refinancing operations is not intended as a further change in the monetary policy stance of the Eurosystem. The new tender mechanism is a response to the severe overbidding which has developed in the context of the current fixed rate tender procedure. For the purpose of signalling the monetary policy stance, the minimum bid rate is designed to play the role performed, until now, by the rate in fixed rate tenders. This change does not in any way rule out the option that, in the future, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem may be conducted in principle as fixed rate tenders. A press release setting out a comprehensive description of the new tender procedure will be issued during the course of next week. Turning to today's other meeting, the General Council considered public finance developments in the EU. The General Council also carried out its first annual review of the functioning of the ERM II, in accordance with Article 16 of the ERM II Agreement. Finally, let me draw your attention to the calendar for meetings of the Governing Council and General Council in 2001. A separate press release listing the dates as well as the related dates for the press conferences will be made available to you this afternoon. In this context. I should also like to point out that the press conference previously announced for 3 August 2000 has been cancelled."
South Korea,2000-06-08,"With the continued expansion of the economy, the current account surplus has been narrowing faster than expected. Consumer prices, however, have remained subdued. The financial markets have been recovering from the apprehension following Hyundai Group's liquidity problems. Due to the increased uncertainties surrounding the corporate and financial restructuring, though, financial institutions have become very sensitive to corporate credit risk and their attitude to lending to the corporate sector has become more conservative. This might bring about a weakening of financial intermediation. Reflecting such real and financial sector situation, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea has decided that the overnight call rate would be maintained at around its current level in June. In order to maintain financial market stability, the confidence of domestic and foreign investors needs to be restored. This could be done only by carrying out the restructuring promptly."
South Africa,2000-06-15,"At its meeting of 14 and 15 June 2000 the Monetary Policy Committee analysed recent international and domestic economic developments and reviewed the monetary policy stance. The main conclusions drawn at this meeting are summarised in this statement. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee there have been indications that economic growth in the United States of America may have slowed down. For instance, the private sector shed 116 000 jobs in May 2000, leading to an increase in the unemployment rate of 0,2 percentage points. As a result, financial markets rallied as fears of a further monetary tightening in the United States receded. It is still too early to tell whether recent data reflect a sustained trend, but it is widely anticipated that it could affect the future monetary policy stance. However, there is a possibility that higher share prices may reinforce the wealth effects that underlie much of the demand pressure in the United States. Clearer signs of an economic recovery in Japan are emerging. Recently released data show that the real gross domestic product of Japan rose at a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 10 per cent in the first quarter of 2000, compared with a decline to over 6 per cent in the fourth quarter of the preceding year. Real production in the euro area increased at a weaker-than-expected growth rate of 2,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2000. However, growth is expected to be higher in the second quarter owing to strong increases in industrial production. The United Kingdom's preliminary first quarter production figures were weaker than projected, with declining growth in manufacturing production. The process of monetary tightening, which had generally been pursued in most of the industrial countries during 1999, continued in 2000. Interest rates were increased when it became apparent that inflation rates were rising. Sharp increases in oil prices put upward pressure on other prices, which in an environment of relatively high growth, made it necessary to apply stricter monetary discipline. The performance of emerging-market economies improved considerably during the first months of 2000. Many of the world's poorest countries, including some in Africa, are recording good growth rates in production. Unfortunately, the political developments in some sub-Saharan African countries impede economic growth in this region. The rate of inflation in emerging-market economies has declined, but the recent depreciation in the currencies of many of these countries, if sustained, may result in an acceleration of inflation. The recently released national accounts statistics confirm that growth in the South African economy slowed down markedly in the first quarter of 2000. Adverse agricultural conditions were to a large extent responsible for the lower growth. The growth in non-agricultural production nevertheless also declined from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 2½ per cent in the last two quarters of 1999 to 2 per cent in the first quarter of 2000, largely because of a levelling off in manufacturing output. This does not bode well for the already poor capacity of the economy to create employment and decrease the unemployment rate. The growth in aggregate domestic demand weakened somewhat in the first quarter of 2000, owing to a fall in the real consumption expenditure of general government. This contributed to a further large increase in inventory accumulation. In contrast to the development in overall demand, the growth in real final consumption expenditure by households accelerated from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1999 to 3½ per cent in the first quarter of 2000. However, consumers avoided financing this expenditure by excessive increases in debt. Household debt as a percentage of personal disposable income therefore declined from 59½ per cent in the first quarter of 1999 to 57 per cent in the first quarter of 2000. Gross fixed capital formation, which had declined in 1999, rose modestly in the first quarter of 2000. The rise in fixed investment was confined to the private sector, while capital expenditure by public corporations and general government contracted further. The level of fixed investment at 14½ per cent of gross domestic product is well below the level required to support economic growth at a rate high enough to lift the employment-creating capacity of the economy. The broadly defined money supply (M3) at the end of April 2000 was close to the value that it had reached at the end of December 1999. In fact. M3 contracted at an annualised rate of 0,2 per cent in the first four months of 2000, whereas it had increased at a rate of 18,9 per cent in the second half of 1999. Moreover, the decline in the money supply in the first four months of 2000 was mainly concentrated in short-term deposits of the non-bank private sector, i.e. in deposits reflecting the transactions demand for money. Mainly because of the statistical carry-over of strong growth in the money supply during the second half of 1999, the twelve-month growth rate in M3 amounted to a relatively high 10,8 per cent in April 2000. Bank credit extension to the private sector expanded slowly during the first four months of 2000. The seasonally adjusted and annualised growth rate in such credit amounted to 5,7 per cent from the end of December 1999 to the end of April 2000, compared with a rate of 8,0 per cent recorded during the last six months of 1999. In April 2000 the twelve-month rate of increase in credit extension to the private sector came to 8,9 per cent. Public finances were characterised by continued discipline in the first four months of 2000. The public-sector borrowing requirement amounted to only 1,3 per cent of gross domestic product in the fiscal year ended 31 March 2000, compared with 3,4 per cent in the preceding fiscal year. Lower capital expenditure by public corporations and a smaller national government deficit made the major contributions to this reduction. Financial market activity remained brisk throughout the first five months of 2000 and share prices on the whole declined up to mid-April and bond prices up to mid-May. Market sentiment then started to change. Share prices rose by 16,6 per cent from a low point on 17 April 2000 to 14 June, while long-term bond yields declined by 70 basis points from a peak value on 10 May 2000 up to 14 June. Foreign investors remained net sellers of South African bonds up to the last week of May, but from 25 May 2000 to 14 June became net purchasers to the amount of R0,8 billion. From the beginning of the year until 14 June their net sales still totalled R15,6 billion. Non-residents have purchased R4,4 billion of equities so far this year, compared with R11,9 billion during the first five months of 1999. In the money market the Treasury bill and bankers' acceptance rates started to rise marginally in April and showed a distinct upward trend during most of May, probably reflecting expectations that the Reserve Bank will react to the weaker rand and higher oil prices. After the beginning of June both these rates began to decline again. Other market-determined rates, such as forward rate agreements and rates on negotiable certificates of deposits, displayed similar patterns. The recent developments in the money and capital markets were also reflected in a change in the shape of the yield curve. The yield curve flattened somewhat with the upward sloping short end reflecting the rise in shorter-term rates and the longer end of the yield curve the decline in longer-term yields. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET. The overall balance of payments was in surplus to the amount of R3,6 billion during the first quarter of 2000. This was the combined result of a surplus of R0,5 billion on the current account and a net inflow of capital not related to reserves of R3,1 billion. After making adjustments for seasonal factors, the current account of the balance of payments was in deficit to an annualised amount of R4,7 billion, i.e. at a slightly lower value than the R5,6 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 1999. Exports of goods continued to perform well and neutralised increases in merchandise imports and net service, income and transfer payments to non-residents. Despite the large net sales of domestic securities by non-residents, a further although considerably smaller surplus was recorded on the financial account of the balance of payments. This was largely the result of net inward direct investment into South Africa and the proceeds obtained from an international bond issue of the government. There was also a further but smaller inflow of foreign equity portfolio capital and inflows arising from trade finance and bank deposits. Despite the overall surplus on the balance of payments, the exchange rate of the rand came under pressure. The weighted value of the rand against a basket of currencies declined by about 7½ per cent from the end of 1999 until the middle of May 2000. This decline in the rand was probably related to the strength of the US dollar and perceptions about the effects of developments in some sub-Saharan African countries. Towards the end of May and in the first two weeks of June 2000 the US dollar weakened considerably on international foreign exchange markets, resulting in a moderate appreciation in the external value of the rand against the dollar. However, the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand declined further to a level on 14 June 2000 that was 8 per cent lower than at the beginning of the year. In view of the weakness of the rand, the Reserve Bank did not reduce its net open foreign currency position during April and May. At the end of May 2000 the net open foreign currency position of the Bank therefore remained at US$10,2 billion. The additional information that has become available since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee about developments in the banking sector, reaffirmed that banks are managing risks in an efficient and sound way. Gross overdues on advances have declined in absolute and relative terms. In addition, banks have made adequate provision for bad and doubtful loans. These provisions, at more than 60 per cent of total gross overdues, are currently well above the international norm of 40 per cent. However, there are signs that the profitability of the banking sector as a whole is coming under some pressure. Lower income combined with increased operating expenses, resulted in marginally lower returns on assets and equity during the first four months of 2000. Consumer and production price indices indicate that inflationary pressures are increasing in South Africa. The rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and urban areas excluding the interest costs on mortgage bonds, i.e. the so-called CPIX which is used as the benchmark for inflation targeting, has continued to accelerate from the fourth quarter of 1999. The higher rates of consumer price inflation were mainly due to increases in the prices of energy and food. If these prices are excluded from the CPIX, the twelve-month rate of increase in this index actually declined from a peak of 7,9 per cent in March 1999 to 6,7 per cent in April 2000. The secondary effects of recent oil and food price increases, as well as the weakness of the rand, therefore seem quite muted or simply not yet fully reflected in an acceleration in the underlying rate of price increases. Moreover, it is possible that the temporary upward pressure exerted by these external shocks may be tempered by fundamental domestic economic factors, such as the modest growth in money supply and bank credit extension; the excess production capacity in the economy; fiscal and monetary discipline; and a slowdown in the growth of nominal unit labour costs. According to projections made by the Reserve Bank, the inflation outlook for South Africa is still positive. Given the effects of external shocks, the growth in the overall CPIX is likely to increase into the second half of 2000, but price increases may then start to slow down and the average growth in CPIX should be within the target band of 3 to 6 per cent for the year 2002. Taking the above circumstances into account, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to maintain the current monetary policy stance."
Israel,2000-06-26,"June 26, 2000 The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for July 2000, according to which its interest rate will remain unchanged The Bank of Israel noted that the decision to leavethe nominal interest rate unchanged is consistent with the attainment of the government's inflation target of an annual rate of 3 to 4 percent for the years 2000 and 2001. Since interest-rate policy affects prices with varying lags, and in order to limit interest-rate fluctuations and subsequent inflation-rate volatility, the Bank of Israel administer interest-rate policy on a monthly basis while assessing expected inflation for the next 12 and 24 months. Consequently, the Bank of Israel explained that one Consumer Price Index (CPI) has no intrinsic significance (whether positive or negative) other than in its ability to alter expected inflation for the policy horizon, i.e., the next 12 or 24 months. The same applies to short-term fluctuations in exchangerate and inflation expectations. This approach is consistent with the framework of striving for price stability over time, and creates the infrastructure necessary for sustained growth. The Bank explained that the decision not to change the rate of interest for July is intended to ensure that expected inflation for a one- and two-year horizon, which rose slightly of late, is consistent with the target range of 3 to 4 percent a year. This is because in the first few months of the year inflation expectations and forecasts for one and two years ahead were in an environment below that required to meet the inflation target. This development has enabled the Bank of Israel to lead a process of interest-rate reduction in these months. The Bank of Israel emphasized that there are dangers to the price stability process that derive inter alia from development on the foreign-currency markets and on money and capital markets. The trend of a rapidly declining interest-rate gap between Israel and abroad, essentially between interest on local currency (which has been reduced) and that on the dollar (which has been rising in the last twelve month), the fall in capital raised by Israeli companies in the US capital market in foreign investment in Israel all affect capital flows and the management of the public's assets and liabilities portfolios. The Bank of Israel again pointed out in this context that the public considers the dollar interest rate as the main substitute for the local-currency interest rate, and this is reflectedin the current dollar share in the currency composition of the foreign-currency assets and liabilities held by the public, as well as of capital flows to and from Israel. The Bank added that the long-term development of the money supply, medium-term macroeconomic targets set in the framework of the discussions on the budget for 2001 with regard to the continuation of the process of reducing both the budget deficit and inflation, and the signs of recovery in Israel's real economic activity, constitute part of the basis for evaluating whether the current nominal rate of interest is appropriate, also for the future, to the achievement of the inflation target.

Euroarea,2000-07-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Mr. Papademos. Governor of the Bank of Greece, to whom the Governing Council has extended a standing invitation following the EU Council's decision on Greece's adoption of the euro on 1 January 2001. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of recent monetary and economic developments and their implications for the risks to future price stability in the euro area. Subsequently, it decided to keep the interest rates on the Eurosystem's monetary policy instruments unchanged. Thus the minimum bid rate in the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem was left at 4.25%, and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were kept unchanged at 5.25% and 3.25% respectively. Allow me to give you an overview of the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary, financial market and other economic developments. In the context of the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, let me start with the latest monetary developments in the euro area. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, covering the period from March to May 2000, stood at 6.3%, which was unchanged from the period from February to April 2000. At 6.3%. M3 growth was substantially above the reference value of 4 1/2%. This deviation of M3 growth from the reference value, combined with the strong growth of both M1 and credit to the private sector, indicates that liquidity conditions continued to be ample in the euro area through May. The increase in ECB interest rates on 8 June - in conjunction with the interest rate increases made since November 1999 - exerts a moderating influence on both money and credit growth. Turning to the second pillar of our strategy, considering real economic developments, recent data indicate that the euro area economy has continued to grow at a robust pace. The first estimate of real GDP growth in the first quarter of this year was 0.7%. Although this was slightly below the average observed in the second half of last year, other indicators all point towards strong growth of the domestic economy. The rate of growth of industrial production, for example, not only increased in April, but also incorporated an upward revision for the first quarter. Industrial and consumer confidence both remain at, or close to, record high levels. At the same time, external developments are continuing to provide a positive stimulus to economic growth in the euro area. Reflecting favourable domestic and external conditions for growth, the outlook for euro area growth continues to be positive. There have not been any major changes in bond and foreign exchange markets since the decision of the Governing Council on 8 June to raise the ECB interest rates. Current bond market yields continue to show market expectations of a period of sustained economic growth in the euro area. At the same time, the accumulated depreciation of the exchange rate of the euro remains a cause for concern and has to be taken into account in the assessment of the risks to price stability. As regards consumer price developments, inflation in May 2000, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), remained at 1.9%. A lower year-on-year change in services prices offset relatively strong rises in other prices, in particular energy and unprocessed food prices. Over the coming months the rate of increase in consumer prices could continue to be affected by lagged effects of the increase in import prices. For the outlook for price stability in the medium term, it is essential that these short-term movements of inflation do not become protracted and translate into second round effects. Overall, the outlook for price stability will be affected by several factors, which will need to be monitored carefully. First, strong monetary growth and ample liquidity conditions call for continuous monitoring. In addition, it will be important, in the current phase of strengthening economic growth, for wages to continue, on average, to grow at rates compatible with the objective of price stability. This, together with structural reform in the labour market, will be important to sustain the process of non-inflationary growth and to reduce unemployment in the euro area. Developments in import prices, which are influenced by the evolution of the exchange rate of the euro and the price of raw materials, may affect the outlook for prices in the period ahead. Finally. I should like to stress that a pro-cyclical loosening of the fiscal policy stance could also add to upward risks to price stability. In this respect, when looking at the euro area as a whole on a consolidated basis, current fiscal budget plans are not sufficiently ambitious in view of the favourable economic prospects. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to say a few words about other issues discussed by the Governing Council. First. I should like to address the euro banknote-related issue concerning the determination of the number of banknotes to be printed before the launch date of 1 January 2002. The latest forecast shows that there will be a need to put 14 billion euro banknotes into circulation, compared with last year's estimate of 13 billion. The increase can be attributed to three main factors: a higher than expected figure for national banknotes in circulation, which forms the basis of estimates of the launch stocks; a higher forecast for the use of low-denomination banknotes; and a somewhat slower than previously expected development in the use of electronic money. Second, the Governing Council also had an exchange of views on recent developments in the EU banking industry. The discussion was based on preparatory work by the Banking Supervision Committee. The Governing Council is well aware that the current process of consolidation is no longer confined to small and medium-sized banks - as it was in the past - but that now it also covers the larger banks at the national level and cross-border mergers and alliances are on the increase. The role of the euro as a factor encouraging this process of consolidation via further integration of money and capital markets is important. The consolidation process is welcome in general since it allows efficiency gains to be achieved in the banking sector. On the other hand, it affects the competitive environment in which banks operate, as well as their risk profile. Therefore, a careful monitoring on the part of the public authorities responsible for prudential supervision and financial stability is required. The Governing Council decided that a report on mergers and acquisitions involving the EU banking industry be prepared for publication in the autumn."
South Korea,2000-07-06,"While the economy has continued its expansion, the current account has continued to be in surplus. Consumer prices have risen significantly in June due to a hike in prices of petroleum-based products and farm-livestock- fisheries products. In the financial markets, the indications of a credit crunch, which had mainly affected several of the large enterprises whose financial position was relatively weak, seemed to be gradually calming down. However, the apprehension resulting from the uncertainties surrounding corporate and financial restructuring still permeated the markets. Taking these factors into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea has decided that the overnight call rate would be maintained at around its current level in July. It was noted that it would be essential to pay closer attention to price developments and to carry out corporate and financial restructuring consistently so that the instability in the financial markets can be resolved fundamentally at its sources. In a related decision, it was resolved that the lending rate on the new Liquidity Adjustment Loans, which are scheduled to be introduced by the Bank of Korea on August 1, 2000, would be set at 4., 5 percent per annum."
Thailand,2000-07-18,"Monetary Policy Board's Decision on 18 July 2000 The Monetary Policy Board met today and concluded that the Thai economy has shown an overall improvement propelled by exports and fiscal expenditures and reinforced by expansion in private consumption and investment. Nevertheless the prevailing excess supply and industrial capacity underutilisation reflected a recovery process which is not yet sufficiently broad based. The agricultural sector still experienced a drop in farm income. number of small and medium enterprises still had not recovered, and a number of corporates were still undergoing debt restructuring. In light of these factors, recent inflation rates have therefore been low, notwithstanding the rising trend of world crude oil prices. Inflation and core inflation were projected to increase moderately but remain below 35 percent in the next 8 quarters, except in quarter 4 of 2001 if VAT is raised from 7 to 10 percent in October 2001. Uncertainty in the external economic conditions, especially the US economy, may affect Thai export and the economy, while the economic recovery at the business sectoral level still poses some pockets of fragility, contributing to reducing pressure on prices. In light of these factors, the Monetary Policy Board today decided to maintain the 14 day repurchase policy rate at 15 percent per annum in order to support the recovery of the economy. The Board will continue to monitor closely the economic conditions and inflationary trend, and will stand ready to adopt an appropriate stance for monetary policy to maintain price stability conducive for sustainable economic growth. Re: Monetary Policy Board's Meeting on 23 May 2000 The Monetary Policy Board met on 23 May 2000 and decided on the following: 1. The MPB sets the target for core inflation (consumer price index excluding raw food and energy) for the years 2000-2002 at 0-35 per cent after considering various factors including inflation trend of Thailand's major trading partners and recent economic conditions in Thailand. The MPB views that the set target would increase Thailand's export competitiveness and help lead to a stable currency. This target will also provide a conducive environment for the nation's economic expansion. The MPB will use the 14-day repurchase rate as the key policy rate in signalling monetary policy stance. The closing rate at the end of day will not be allowed to depart from the policy rate by more than +/- 1/16 percent. Other repurchase rates such as 1-day, 7-day, and 16 month will be determined by market conditions and their movements will have no implication on signalling future monetary policy stance. In this meeting, the MPB decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 15 per cent per annum. The MPB will meet to decide the key policy rate every six weeks. The next meeting will be held on 18 July 2000 and the first inflation report will be released on 25 July 2000."
South Korea,2000-08-03,"The economy has maintained its expansion and the current account has continued in surplus. In July, however, consumer prices rose at a relatively high rate due to rises in prices of public services and farm- livestock-fisheries products. Moreover, there are many underlying factors such as additional rises in wages, prices of public services and raw materials, that could further push the prices up. In the financial markets, financial intermediation contracted due to mounting apprehensions as Hyundai Group's liquidity problems reemerged in late July while some large enterprises still have difficulties in issuing corporate bonds and commercial paper. Should financial instability prove prolonged, it may have a negative impact on the real sector by way, for example, of a decline in business and consumer confidence. Although there seems to be a need to take control over aggregate demand as imbalances in the real sector enlarge, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea has decided that the overnight call rate would be maintained at around its current level in August focusing on stability of financial markets. Although it is urgent to first stabilize the financial markets at present, the signs of higher inflation are becoming more evident. Therefore, consistent and rapid restructuring efforts have to be made in both the corporate and the financial sectors to create stable conditions for more flexible macroeconomic policies."
Chile,2000-08-10,"Santiago. August 10, 2000 Press release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at its current level of UF plus 5.5% and that liquidity credit lines would also remain unchanged. The Board analyzed recent economic developments and the outlook for the next twenty-four months, based on May's Monetary Policy Report. The data examined points to economic activity continuing along the growth path foreseen in May, based on dynamic external demand. Domestic demand and employment growth have both slowed in recent months whereas underlying inflation has remained stable. World economic growth continues to strengthen and there is less likelihood of any brusque change in the United States economy. Internationally, there is a persistent scarcity of liquidity and oil prices continue volatile. In the past thirty days, a set of more expansive monetary conditions already identified in the previous Board meeting has consolidated: medium- and long-term interest rates have continued to fall and the peso has further depreciated. Domestic demand, economic activity and employment can thus all be expected to grow faster at least within the projection horizon. However, there are no apparent inflationary risks given the idle installed capacity and employment."
South Africa,2000-08-11,"At a meeting on 10 and 11 August 2000 the Monetary Policy Committee reviewed economic conditions and the monetary policy stance. The main conclusions of the Committee are summarised in this statement. 1.1 Global economic conditions remain favourable. In the United States the growth in real gross domestic product improved from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 4,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2000 to 5,2 per cent in the second quarter. This strong growth was fuelled primarily by business investment and federal government spending. Over the same period, the inflation rate rose further largely due to increases in energy and food prices. 1.2 Growth in the euro area is robust and is expected to average more than 3 per cent in 2000. However, the euro remains under pressure, and the weaker currency together with higher oil prices led to an inflation rate of 2,4 per cent in June 2000. This is considerably above the inflation reference rate of 2,0 per cent. In the United Kingdom, real gross domestic product grew by a stronger than expected 3,6 per cent in the second quarter of 2000. Inflationary pressures also arose because of increases in the price of petrol and oil. 1.3 The Japanese economy has recovered somewhat since the beginning of 2000, despite the weak consumer demand. The Policy Board of the Bank of Japan is of the opinion that the downward pressure on prices stemming from insufficient demand is abating. The Board has decided at its recent meeting to terminate its zero interest rate policy. 1.4 Growth in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America is still strong with no signs of undue inflationary pressures. The performance of African economies has varied considerably, with some parts of sub-Saharan Africa being affected by political and social developments. Some corrective measures are being put in place, as demonstrated by the recent devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar by about 24 per cent against the United States dollar in order to improve the price competitiveness of Zimbabwe's export sector. 1.5 In recent weeks the oil price has declined from levels above US$30 per barrel to between US$26 to US$28 following a decision by OPEC to increase production. If these lower levels are sustained, inflationary pressures will be reduced internationally. 2.1 Economic activity in South Africa expanded during the first half of 2000, but at a considerably slower pace than in the second half of 1999. From preliminary information it appears that the more subdued economic growth was mostly concentrated in the primary and secondary sectors of the economy. This was reflected in considerable underutilisation of production capacity in manufacturing. The real value added by the services sectors seems to have grown at a solid rate in the first six months of 2000, led by growth in the trade, transport and communication sectors. 2.2 Preliminary estimates indicate that aggregate final demand continued to expand during the first six months of 2000. In particular, growth in real final consumption expenditure by households remained firm, largely because of increased expenditure on durable and semi-durable goods. However, inventory accumulation was cut back, partly in response to some involuntary inventory build-up in previous quarters, causing a decline in real gross domestic expenditure in the second quarter of 2000. 2.3 Labour absorption in the formal non-agricultural sectors of the economy remained weak in the first three months of 2000. The latest information about the labour market is nonetheless more positive, showing that unemployment declined from 25 per cent of the economically active population in October 1998 to 23 per cent in October 1999. Total employment increased over this period, not least owing to strong growth in informal-sector employment. Another positive factor in the labour market is the low year-on-year increase in the cost of labour per unit of real output, rising by only 0,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2000. 3.1 Reflecting the subdued growth in economic activity, the level of the broadly defined money supply (M3) at the end of June 2000 was virtually the same as at the end of 1999. In fact, the seasonally adjusted quarterly average value of M3 declined slightly from the first to the second quarter of the year. Measured over a period of twelve months. M3 increased by 8,8 per cent in June 2000. 3.2 Bank credit extension to the private sector increased at an average annualised rate of 4,9 per cent in the first six months of 2000. Private-sector businesses were increasingly prepared to satisfy part of their financing needs through non-bank mechanisms, such as issuing share capital or debt securities. This had a dampening effect on credit intermediated via the banking system and on the growth of money supply. By contrast, credit extended to households showed signs of recovery after a period of consolidation. 3.3 The fiscal situation remained sound in the April-June quarter of fiscal 2000/01, with government revenue increasing more rapidly than government expenditure. The accumulated budget deficit for the current fiscal year developed closely in accordance with its typical seasonal pattern. 4.1 Lively trading conditions prevailed in the bond market during the second quarter of 2000, but turnovers declined somewhat from the levels attained in the first quarter. The domestic bond market has been in a strong recovery phase since the last Monetary Policy Committee meeting in June. The yield on the R150-bond strengthened from just above 14 per cent to 12,75 per cent on 10 August 2000. As a consequence, the yield curve became flatter over this period. The difference between the nominal yield on long-term government bonds and the real yield on the inflation-linked government bond has declined significantly since May, tentatively signalling that inflation expectations have moderated. 4.2 Foreign investors became net buyers of South African bonds in July to an amount of R2,2 billion. However, the net sales by non-residents still totalled R13,1 billion in the first seven months of 2000. 4.3 Turnover on the secondary equity market remained high in the first six months of 2000, but share prices were relatively depressed. The all-share price index, on balance, declined from a peak of 9 227 on 17 January 2000 to 8 066 on 10 August 2000, or by 12,6 per cent. Non-residents purchased equities to the amount of R6,8 billion in the first seven months of 2000, compared with R24,7 billion in the same period of the preceding year. August 2000 to date has demonstrated a considerable improvement in net purchases by non-residents of both bonds and equities amounting to R3,1 billion. 4.4 In the money market, the interest rates which respond to changes in the Reserve Bank's repo rate, i.e. the interbank overnight rate, prime overdraft rate and mortgage rates, have remained broadly unchanged since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. Some of the other rates, such as those on Treasury bills and bankers' acceptances, declined only marginally. In contrast, the rates on forward rate agreements displayed significant downward movements from 15 June to 10 August 2000. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET. 5.1 Despite a large oil import bill, the current account of the balance of payments changed from a deficit in the first quarter of 2000 to a healthy surplus in the second quarter. This was the combined result of a decrease in the value and volume of merchandise imports, and a further substantial increase in the value of merchandise exports. The exports of mining and manufactured goods have performed remarkably well during the first six months of 2000, reflecting the weaker external value of the rand and strong international demand. 5.2 Investor sentiment deteriorated in the second quarter, leading to a net outflow of capital from South Africa. To a large extent this consisted of a net outflow of portfolio investments, but some South African companies also sought to diversify their operations into other parts of the world. 5.3 With the surplus on the current account of the balance of payments falling short of the deficit on the financial account, the overall balance of payments showed a small deficit in the second quarter of 2000. The net international reserve position of the country consequently deteriorated somewhat, and the Reserve Bank was able to reduce its net open foreign currency position only marginally to US$10,1 billion at the end of the second quarter. At the end of July the net open foreign currency position was reduced further to US$9,9 billion. 5.4 As could be expected with an overall deficit on the balance of payments, the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand declined by 2,7 per cent from the end of March 2000 to the end of June 2000. Following the improvement in the transactions of securities by non-residents in July and August, the weighted value of the rand rose by 1,4 per cent in this period. On 11 August the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand was approximately 5,0 per cent below its level at the beginning of the year. 6.1 The overall efficiency in the banking sector improved somewhat in June 2000. Not only did growth in capital and reserves remain strong, but the capital adequacy ratio also rose from 12 per cent in the first quarter of 2000 to 12,5 per cent in the second quarter. Liquidity pressures eased somewhat because of a lower dependency on short-term wholesale deposits for funding. An increase in the anticipated liquidity mismatch appeared to be partly of a structural nature and partly a result of some banks' views on future interest-rate movements. Although overdue accounts increased slightly in the quarter ended June 2000, both general and specific provisions increased accordingly. 7.1 The increase in overall consumer prices excluding the interest costs on mortgage bonds for metropolitan and other urban areas (the CPIX) accelerated from 6,5 per cent in October 1999 to 7,9 per cent in June 2000. When omitting the effects of the rise in domestic prices of energy and food (as related to flood damage), the twelve-month rate of increase in the CPIX remained unchanged at 6,9 per cent over the same period. 7.2 For policy purposes the price increases arising from exogenous shocks cannot, of course, be ignored. It is, however, important to note that inflation in South Africa over the past nine months was largely related to supply-side shocks on which monetary policy has little effect over the short run. However, some important counter-inflationary forces were also present in the economy. Unit labour costs, money supply and credit aggregates grew at low rates, the rate of increase in aggregate domestic demand was low and the economy operated well below production capacity. 7.3 From projections made by the Reserve Bank it appears that inflation is near an upper turning point. This is supported by the recent slower rate of increase in production prices, which usually precedes inflation-rate changes in consumer prices. All things remaining the same, the projections of the Bank show that the increase in CPIX should slow down over the next two years and that the average annual rate of increase in the year 2002 should be within the target range of 3 to 6 per cent. The spill-over effect of external inflationary pressures on domestic prices will nevertheless be carefully monitored to ensure that appropriate steps are taken so that the inflation target range is met. 7.4 Taking all the above circumstances into account, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to maintain the current monetary policy stance."
Thailand,2000-09-05,"Monetary Policy Board's Decision on 5 September 2000 The Monetary Policy Board reviewed the economic conditions and inflation trend, and adjusted some of the assumptions regarding external factors. Recent increases in oil prices and the depreciation of the baht against the US dollar do pose some risk to inflation and hence economic growth. Nevertheless the Monetary Policy Board considered the magnitude of these risks to be within the anticipated ranges. Exports which is the main engine of economic recovery continued to expand, underpinned by the economic growth of our trading partners. The US monetary policy has to a certain degree lessened the risk of hard landing of the US economy. The forecast trend of core inflation still remains below 35 percent, which is within the target range. The Monetary Policy Board therefore decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 15 percent per annum in order to continue to accommodate the economic recovery. Bank of Thailand September 5th 2000."
South Korea,2000-09-07,"The economy has maintained its expansion and the current account has continued in surplus, but prices are showing an unstable pattern of movements. Consumer prices have maintained a sharply rising trend over the last three months since June due to a surge of international oil prices and a series of hikes in public service charges. While the major changes have taken place in the domestic and international environments including the steep rise in oil prices, financial market apprehensions have receded. Nevertheless, it is difficult to accept that there has been substantial improvements in the structural fragility of the financial markets. Although the acceleration of the rate of price increases must be addressed urgently, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea has decided that the overnight call rate should be maintained at around its current level in September in view of the mood of uncertainty prevailing in the financial markets."
Euroarea,2000-09-14,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meetings of the General Council and the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council of the ECB today conducted its regular examination of recent monetary and economic developments and their implications for the risks to future price stability in the euro area. Subsequently, it decided to keep the interest rates on the Eurosystem's monetary policy instruments unchanged. Thus, the minimum bid rate in the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem was left at 4.50%, and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were kept at 5.50% and 3.50%, respectively. Allow me to give you an overview of the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary, financial market and other economic developments. As regards the developments in the context of the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB, no new monetary data have become available since our decision taken on 31 August 2000 to raise the main ECB interest rates. After having increased at a very strong pace in the first quarter of 2000. M3 growth has been showing some signs of moderation over recent months. This moderation has mainly been a consequence of lower growth in the most liquid components of M3, which bear little or no remuneration, indicating that the monetary policy measures taken since November 1999 are gradually feeding their way through. At the same time, the average of annual M3 growth rates for the period from May to July 2000, at 5.5%, continued to deviate on the upside from the reference value of 4 1/2%. The pronounced expansion of credit to the private sector up to July also suggested that households and firms continued to regard financing conditions in the euro area as favourable. In the context of the robust expansion of economic activity, continued ample liquidity conditions would constitute a risk to price stability. Turning to the second pillar, real GDP growth in the euro area, according to first estimates published by Eurostat today, reached 3 3/4% (on an annualised basis) in the first half of 2000. Currently available forecasts predict that growth will remain above 3% next year. The strength of the euro area's economic expansion in the past few months is in line with these forecasts. In fact, recent indicators suggest that, following the period of acceleration, the economic expansion may now have settled at a high rate of growth. The overall level of confidence has remained at, or close to, record highs in recent months. Moreover, employment continued to grow strongly in the first half of this year and the rate of capacity utilisation has risen further. Taken together, these factors should underpin the growth of private consumption and investment, and thus that of domestic demand. The positive outlook for the euro area is also supported by external developments. The outlook for growth of the world economy, and thus for growth of euro area exports, has remained favourable. Forecasts of world growth have consistently been revised upwards over the past few months. Expectations of a period of sustained economic growth in the euro area can also be found in euro area bond markets. Overall, longer-term bond yields in the euro area have shown a very high level of stability in the course of this year, with fluctuations being contained within a relatively narrow range. The annual rate of increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) was 2.4% in July 2000. Recent consumer price developments in the euro area have been very much influenced by the strong rise in oil prices and the depreciation of the exchange rate of the euro. While monetary policy cannot address short-term developments in prices, it is imperative for monetary policy that medium-term upward pressure on prices be contained. The risk that the current pressure on the HICP might spill over onto costs and prices determined in the domestic economy must be taken seriously. This holds true in particular in the context of the favourable prospects for economic growth. The Governing Council reacted to this picture by raising the main ECB interest rates at its meeting on 31 August 2000. This step followed a series of interest rate increases implemented since November 1999. The Governing Council will continue to remain alert to emerging risks to price stability. It is a matter of fact that recent oil price increases have caused the terms of trade of the euro area to deteriorate, and thus have also reduced real income. This loss of real income cannot be avoided for the economy as a whole. Attempts to shift the burden of this loss within the economy will risk endangering the continuation of a non-inflationary growth process. For the maintenance of price stability, it will be particularly important, in the current phase of strengthening economic growth, that wages continue, on average, to grow at rates compatible with the objective of price stability. Any attempt for wages to catch up in reaction to recent oil price increases would be highly detrimental to the current favourable growth prospects, since monetary policy would need to react to the resulting upward pressure on prices. Governments also have to play a role in order not to convey the false impression that the costs stemming from the increase in oil prices could be avoided by relaxing budgetary policies. This would not be in line with the needs of establishing budget positions in balance or in surplus and would complicate the fostering of tax reforms conducive to a stronger growth potential of the euro area. I should also like to reiterate that the prospects for a stronger potential for growth in the euro area will depend very much on progress made in enhancing the flexibility of labour and goods markets in the euro area. Although reform efforts in several countries have been heading in the right direction, there is still much to be done when looking at the area as a whole. Finally, let me also say a few words about recent exchange rate developments. I noted earlier that, from a monetary policy point of view, these developments are a cause for concern as they add to the upward pressure on consumer prices in the euro area. These concerns are compounded by the fact that the exchange rate of the euro does not appear appropriate when looking at economic fundamentals. As you are aware, we have been expressing this concern for some time. In the meantime, we have witnessed a considerable improvement in the economic growth prospects for the euro area. At the same time, owing to measures taken by the Governing Council, the outlook for price stability in the medium term in the euro area has remained intact. At present, inflation in the euro area is among the lowest in the world. The fact that the euro has continued to depreciate over recent months is not in line with these strong economic fundamentals in the euro area. Recent global exchange rate developments are also not in line with international balance of payments positions. Our concerns on this issue remain serious and we shall monitor developments closely. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to say a few words about other issues discussed by the Governing Council. First. I should like to inform you that the Governing Council has agreed on a TARGET reimbursement scheme for the benefit of TARGET participants in the event of malfunctioning in TARGET. The scheme will apply whenever the same-day processing of payment orders within TARGET cannot be completed. The reimbursement scheme is intended to compensate participants for certain higher costs they incur in having recourse to the standing facilities of the Eurosystem as a result of a malfunctioning. In order to ensure a level playing-field, the scheme also applies to participants in euro real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems of non-participating national central banks. The legal framework for this reimbursement scheme is reflected in an amended ""TARGET Guideline"" which, in line with the ECB's policy of enhanced transparency, will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and made available on the ECB's website shortly. Second, the Governing Council addressed issues relating to cross-border retail payment services, which are of particular interest for euro area consumers. You may recall that the ECB published a report on this subject a year ago, calling on the banking industry to improve the unsatisfactory service level for cross-border credit transfers before January 2002. Today, on the basis of a Progress Report, we have reviewed the advances of the banking industry against the objectives set by the Eurosystem and we have identified the outstanding issues that need quickly to be addressed. The Progress Report will be available on the ECB's website shortly."
South Africa,2000-09-21,"At a meeting on 20 and 21 September 2000 the Monetary Policy Committee reviewed international and domestic economic conditions and the monetary policy stance. The main conclusions of the committee are summarised in this statement. 1.1 A significant development on the international economic scene has been the continued increase in the oil price. At the time of the previous Monetary Policy Committee meeting, the oil price had responded to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) announcement of output increases by falling from a level above US$30 to below US$26 per barrel. Since then the oil price has moved upwards again to US$37 per barrel in early September. After a decision by OPEC to increase output further, the price has fluctuated between US$30 to US$35 per barrel. In view of the lack of additional refining capacity, the low American oil stocks, a continued increase in world economic growth and with the onset of winter in the northern hemisphere, there is a likelihood of continued pressure on oil prices over the short term. 1.2 As could be expected, the increase in the oil price has contributed to a rise in inflation in most oil-importing countries. For instance, in the United States the year-on-year rate of increase in the all-goods consumer price index has accelerated from levels of around 1,5 per cent at the beginning of 1999 to 3,4 per cent in August 2000. Similarly, the year-on-year rate of increase in consumer prices in the euro area accelerated from 0,8 per cent to 2,3 per cent over the same period. In contrast with these developments. Japan continued to experience deflationary conditions in the first seven months of 2000. 1.3 Up to now, the increase in the crude oil price seems to have had little effect on global economic growth. The second-quarter real growth in the United States, seasonally adjusted and annualised, amounted to 5,3 per cent. However, indications are that the growth rate in the United States is moderating. Growth in consumer spending is slowing down and the labour market is less tight than it had been, a marginal increase in the unemployment rate having been recorded in the second quarter of 2000. Productivity growth amounted to a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 5,7 per cent in the second quarter of 2000, resulting in a decline in unit labour costs and reduced pressure on inflation. 1.4 Economic growth in the euro area is expected to remain robust, despite an increase of 25 basis points in interest rates announced by the European Central Bank at the end of August. According to preliminary official estimates the real gross domestic product of the United Kingdom grew at a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 3,6 per cent in the second quarter of 2000, following an increase of 2,0 per cent in the first quarter of this year. The recovery in Japan has also been stronger than expected at a seasonally adjusted annualised growth rate of 4,2 per cent in the second quarter of 2000. However, consumer spending remains weak in Japan and leading indicators show a mixed picture. 1.5 Growth in the emerging markets of Asia has moderated somewhat in the second quarter of 2000, and some increased inflationary pressure has been observed in Indonesia and Korea mainly as a result of higher oil prices. Growth in most Latin American countries has slowed down. 2.1 From available information it is difficult to determine whether the acceleration in the growth rate of real gross domestic product from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of about 1 per cent in the first quarter of 2000 to 1 and a half per cent in the second quarter, continued in the third quarter. Some indicators point to an improvement in economic activity while others indicate declining output volumes, making it difficult to interpret the overall change in the economy. 2.2 The monthly index of manufacturing production apparently resumed its upward movement towards the end of the second quarter of 2000. Moreover, manufacturing capacity utilisation picked up slightly, electricity generation was rising solidly, real wholesale sales showed strong growth, buildings completed and new building plans approved continued to recover, and new vehicle sales remained firm. Higher and more sustainable economic expansion was also reflected in increases in new company registrations, and declines in company liquidations and insolvencies of individuals and partnerships. 2.3 Contrary to these developments, signs of a deceleration in economic activity were given by a decline in mining output and a levelling off in the rate of increase in transactions in the real-estate market. Taking into account an expected increase in agricultural production due to the harvesting of summer crops in the third quarter, conditions seem to indicate continued moderate growth in the third quarter of 2000. 3.1 The level of the broadly defined M3 money supply has declined somewhat since the end of 1999. Over the seven-month period to the end of July 2000. M3 recorded an annualised rate of decline of 1,4 per cent. This reflected fairly subdued economic activity, lower absolute and relative returns on deposits, some disintermediation, and in July in particular, a build-up of government deposits with the banking sector. 3.2 Credit extension to the private sector recorded an annualised rate of increase of 8,3 per cent over the seven months to the end of July 2000. In July it grew at a high annualised rate of almost 22 per cent. However, a large part of this sudden increase resulted from changes in accounting practices. 3.3 The public-sector borrowing requirement amounted to R7,7 billion in the April-June quarter of 2000, against R10,6 billion in the corresponding quarter of 1999. The cumulative budget deficit for the current fiscal year is well contained and closely follows the typical seasonal pattern. Treasury bills and foreign loans have so far been the main instruments used to finance the deficit. 4.1 Turnover in the bond market, share market and futures market picked up in August 2000, having not been quite as brisk in July and during most of the second quarter of the year. 4.2 Bond rates were relatively volatile during the third quarter of 2000. At first they generally drifted lower during July and August and declined markedly towards the end of August, probably owing to the reinvestment in bonds of the larger part of the coupon interest of R10,1 billion paid on government debt at month-end. Subsequently, yields rose somewhat due to the increase in the oil price and a stronger dollar. At the same time non-residents became net sellers of bonds, after they had purchased bonds on a net basis of R2,8 billion in July and August. 4.3 Share prices continued to recover during the third quarter of 2000. These prices have now increased by 25 per cent from their recent trough on 17 April 2000 to 19 September 2000. Non-residents contributed to this recovery, having been net buyers of South African shares since April 2000. Their total net purchases of shares from the beginning of April 2000 up to 19 September 2000 amounted to R13,0 billion. 4.4 Money-market interest rates continued to move sideways in the third quarter of 2000. There were, however, slight increases in the rates on forward agreements and shorter-term negotiable certificates of deposit towards the end of August. 4.5 The tendency displayed by the yield curve to flatten at the short end and to shift downwards at the long end, was reversed recently. Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the short end of the yield curve has become steeper and the longer end of the curve has shifted upwards parallel to the previous position. This probably reflected the market's uncertainty of the possible impact of the high oil price on inflation and interest rates. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET. 5.1 The trade account registered a further but considerably smaller surplus in July 2000. This decline in the trade surplus was mainly due to a decrease of nearly 10 per cent in the seasonally adjusted value of merchandise exports. This decrease could be seen in nearly all the main categories of export goods. More particularly, a sharp decrease was recorded in the exports of base metals, agricultural products, chemicals, and machinery and electrical equipment. Despite this decline in merchandise exports during July, the three-month moving average value of exports continued to rise. 5.2 The seasonally adjusted value of merchandise imports declined by about 3 per cent in July. A sharp increase in the imports of petroleum products was offset by declines in the value of manufactured goods imported. The three-month moving average value of imports increased further, probably in line with signs of economic recovery. 5.3 The gross gold and other foreign reserves of the Reserve Bank increased by R1,1 billion in July and August to a level of R52,1 billion at the end of August. Over the same period the net oversold forward position in foreign currency of the Reserve Bank was reduced by US$0,2 billion to US$9,7 billion at the end of August 2000. 5.4 After the external value of the rand had strengthened markedly from the end of May until the end of August 2000, it started to come under pressure early in September. The recent weakness of the rand was mainly a reflection of the strength of the US dollar. Since the beginning of the year, the rand has depreciated by about 19 per cent against the dollar. The general weakness of currencies against the dollar is demonstrated by depreciations of 21 per cent for the euro, 16 per cent for pound sterling and 22 per cent for the Australian dollar over the same period. The nominal effective exchange rate of the rand has therefore declined by only 6 per cent from the end of 1999 up to 20 September 2000. 6.1 Conditions in the banking sector remained stable during July. Growth in total assets improved marginally, while capital and reserves rose strongly. Although the profitability of banks declined in July, liquidity improved. The anticipated short-term liquidity mismatch as a percentage of total funding declined significantly, whereas wholesale deposits as a percentage of total funding declined slightly. 7.1 The increase in the oil price and the damage to agricultural crops caused by adverse weather conditions were the major factors responsible for the continued rise of consumer price inflation in metropolitan and other urban areas, excluding mortgage interest cost (CPIX). The year-on-year increase in the CPIX has accelerated from 6,5 per cent in October 1999 to 8,2 per cent in August 2000. If fuel and food prices are excluded. CPIX inflation declined slightly from 6,8 per cent to 6,6 per cent over the same period. 7.2 For the same reasons as those stated for the acceleration in consumer price inflation, the year-on-year increase in production prices also accelerated from 5,7 per cent in September 1999 to 10,1 per cent in April 2000, before declining to 8,6 per cent in July. However, if energy and food prices are omitted, the year-on-year increase in production prices has continued to accelerate from a low of 3,2 per cent in November 1999 to 4,8 per cent in July 2000. This upward trend was mainly due to increases in the prices of imported goods, while domestically generated inflation has remained low and has shown a downward tendency from April 2000. 7.3 The domestic fundamental factors for containing inflation remain favourable. These include low growth in nominal unit labour costs, surplus production capacity in the economy, no signs of excessive growth in demand, sluggish growth in money supply and bank credit extension, prudent fiscal and monetary policies and increased competition arising from tariff reforms. On top of this, the rate of increase in food prices seems to be levelling off. 7.4 In view of these circumstances the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to maintain the current monetary policy stance. However, the Monetary Policy Committee will continue to closely monitor the possible second-round effects of the depreciation in the exchange rate and continued high prices of petroleum."
Israel,2000-09-25,"September 25, 2000 The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for October 2000, according to which its interest rate will be reduced by 0.3 percentage points. The Bank of Israel notes that the decision to lowerthe nominal interest rate for October by this amount is consistent with the inflation target set by the government for the next few years, and thus also supports the attainment ofthe government's other targets without endangering the achievement of the inflation target. The government decided that interest policy should focus on attaining the inflation target of 2.5 to 3.5 percent for 2001, 2 to 3 percent for 2002, and 1 to 3 percent-arange which is defined as price stability-from 2003 onwards. Setting an inflation target with such a time scale, which reflects a commitment to maintaining long-term price stability, helps interest-rate policy achieve its objective to bring inflation into the range defined as price stability and maintaining it at that level while minimizing fluctuations in the rate of interest on the one hand, and on the other to sustain and provide afirm basis for the current export-led economic growth which depends to a large extent on conditions of economic stability. The Bank of Israel stresses that the interest rate cannot also be used as an instrument with which to achieve other goals such as ensuring a specific path or particular level for the exchange rate, unless they happen to derive from the inflation target determined by the government. The Bank again states that fluctuations in the exchange rate may sometimes be significant due to external factors, and this must be borne in mind by policy makers and by market players. The Bank of Israel notes again that the assessment of the inflation path for one and more years ahead-currently between 2 and 3 percent a year-is based as always on the Bank's forecasts of inflation, on inflationexpectations derived from the capital market, and on the predictions of various private forecasters. In this context, it is estimates of inflation for the next 12 months and beyond that are significant, and not any single Consumer Price Index, whether it happens to be relatively high or low, nor estimates for any period shorter than one year (for instance for the four months till the end of the year 2000). Similarly, short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate or in inflation expectations also hold no significance, unless they incorporate elements that may alter the assessments of inflation within the policy horizon-the following 12 months and beyond. The Bank adds that changes in the money supply overtime, the development of real economic activity with a relatively rapid rise in wages, and fiscal developments, all these also form part of the basis for assessing current and future interest-rate policy which is aimed at achieving the inflation target. The Bank of Israel notes once again that the process of price stabilization is still facing dangers which arise inter alia from the fluctuations in fuel prices and the reduction in the interest-rate differentials between Israel and overseas taking into account the risk premium which international capital markets attribute to Israel's economy (currently estimated at between 0.8 percentage points for the short term and 1.9 percentage points for the long term). The contraction of interest-rate differentials has implications for capital flows and the management of the public's assets and liabilities portfolios, and thus for Israel's financial markets. The Bank of Israel again points out in this context that the dollar interest rate is the main substitute for the local-currency interest rate, because of the present currency composition of the public's foreign-currency assets and liabilities and of capital flows to and from Israel.

Euroarea,2000-10-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The following decisions were taken today:. The minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 4.75%, starting from the operation to be settled on 11 October 2000. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 5.75%, with effect from 6 October 2000. The interest rate on the deposit facility will be raised by 0.25 percentage point to 3.75%, with effect from 6 October 2000. Including today's adjustment, since November 1999 we have raised ECB interest rates by a total of 225 basis points, with the objective of sustaining price stability in the euro area over the medium term. Today's decisions continue to aim at ensuring that upward pressures on consumer prices stemming from oil prices and the foreign exchange rate of the euro do not translate into more permanent inflationary tendencies. It is important to address these risks adequately in order to preserve steady GDP and employment growth in the medium term. Let me explain our decisions in greater detail by reporting on our regular examination of recent monetary, financial and economic developments and their implications for monetary policy aiming to maintain price stability in the medium-term. Starting with the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB, the three-month average of annual M3 growth declined to 5.3% in the period from June to August 2000, from 5.5% in the period from May to July 2000. As had been indicated earlier, in August the preparations of telecommunications firms to transfer the funds due in early September to purchase licences in the German UMTS auction appeared to have a temporary upward impact on M3 growth. Taking this special factor into account, short-term developments in monetary aggregates seem to be more moderate than the August data would suggest. This notwithstanding, from a medium-term point of view, liquidity conditions continue to be ample in the euro area. This assessment is based on the protracted deviation of M3 growth from the reference value since the start of Stage Three of EMU, coupled with the still relatively high growth of loans to the private sector. Hence, risks to price stability stemming from monetary developments remain on the upside. Turning to the second pillar, we had a thorough discussion on the main factors of relevance to the outlook for price stability at the current juncture. One important factor under examination was the price of oil, which reached new peaks in mid-September before falling to some extent more recently. Contrary to earlier expectations, energy price developments did not moderate but rather continued to put considerable upward pressure on HICP inflation rates. The low external value of the euro has heightened the risks of increases in import prices gradually being passed on to consumer prices. As you are aware, the recent movements in the exchange rate of the euro gave rise to concerns, which the ECB shared with the governors and ministers of finance of all the G7 countries, that it might have adverse implications for the world economy. In order to address these concerns, on 22 September, at the ECB's initiative, the monetary authorities of the United States. Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada joined the ECB in a concerted intervention in the foreign exchange markets. The ECB and its partners will continue to monitor developments closely and to co-operate in foreign exchange markets as appropriate. Within the euro area, data are pointing to strong real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2000, confirming our previous positive expectations for this year and for 2001. While the possibility cannot be ruled out that the increase in oil prices as such may temporarily dampen growth dynamics over the short term, the forces underlying solid growth in the medium term remain in place. These relate to external demand, which is supported by a strong world economy, as well as to domestic demand, which is supported by both continued favourable financing conditions and strong employment growth. Today's decisions should contribute to maintaining these overall prospects by preventing the emergence of expectations for inflation in the medium term. In fact, when monitoring bond market developments we saw our policy confirmed by continued expectations of lasting price stability and robust growth. Monetary policy continuously needs to ensure that current inflation rates do not affect inflation expectations and thereby both price-setting and wage formation. It is particularly important that this message be understood in an environment in which oil price and exchange rate developments may lead to HICP inflation rates remaining above 2% for a more protracted period than earlier expected. We are currently seeing the direct effects of such external developments on the HICP rate of inflation, with 2.3% in August and, most likely, a higher rate in September. Earlier expectations that the high annual increase in energy prices would gradually moderate in the course of 2000, owing to a levelling-off or even decline in energy prices, have not materialised thus far. Hence, it will be some time before HICP inflation returns to rates below 2%. The action which we have taken today should be understood as a means of maintaining confidence in price stability over the medium term. As I said at our previous press conference, higher oil prices imply a loss of income for the economy as a whole. In a market economy, the rise in the price of energy is to be reflected in relative price adjustments, so it should affect supply and demand in relation to both particular sources of energy as well as other goods and services. It will be important for social partners to continue to act as responsibly as they have done in the recent past. Wage moderation has made an important contribution to the progress in job creation and in reducing unemployment observed so far. A continuation of this attitude will be a key factor in contributing to non-inflationary growth at a robust pace and should ultimately result in higher employment and the preservation of real income growth for wage earners as well as in sustainable conditions for companies. The governments of the euro area countries can help the economy to adjust smoothly to the increase in energy prices in several ways. One way is to step up efforts towards structural reform aimed at enhancing the functioning of labour and product markets. This will increase the resilience of the economy to adverse shocks, increase competition and ensure appropriate price-setting by companies. Governments must avoid the mistakes of the past, when fiscal policies were relaxed in response to the effects stemming from increases in energy prices. At the current juncture, fiscal policies should avoid any pro-cyclical bias and should aim at reaching sustainable fiscal positions in the medium term more quickly."
South Korea,2000-10-05,"While the economy has maintained its expansion and the current account has continued in surplus, signs of price instability are now becoming more evident. Consumer prices have maintained a sharply rising trend over the four months since June mainly due to the surge in international oil prices and rises in public service charges and in prices of farm-livestock-fisheries products. The financial markets showed large fluctuations at one stage due to a combination of factors including a rapid rise in international oil prices, the drop in semiconductor prices, and the breakdown of the planned deal for Daewoo Motor Company. Market apprehensions, however, have subsided somewhat following the blunting of the surge in international oil prices and the recent publication of the plan for corporate and financial restructuring. Meanwhile, despite the price rises in an expansionary phase of the economy, the overnight call rate has been kept low as the emphasis has been placed on financial market stability. There is concern that keeping the overnight call rate at its current level would give rise to an undesirable bunching of funds at the short term end of the market and generate inflationary expectations in future. Taking price movements and the situation of the financial markets into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise its target for the overnight call rate from 5., 00 percent to 5., 25 percent. In a related decision, the lending rate on Liquidity Adjustment Loans is to be kept at its current level."
Chile,2000-10-10,"Santiago. October 10, 2000 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at its current level of UF plus 5% and that liquidity credit lines would also remain unchanged. As usual, the Board analyzed recent economic developments and the outlook for the next twenty-four months, based on September's Monetary Policy Report. As expected. September's twelve-month inflation rate (4.2%) exceeded the upper limit of the target range of 4%. This is transitory, coherent with the inflation projection given in September's Monetary Policy Report. It should also be pointed out that most of the increase in inflation this year is related to international oil prices which pass through to domestic prices and is not directly connected with demand, as can be seen by the indicators of underlying inflation which remain within the target range. Moreover, the return to normal of international oil prices and the stability of real exchange rate are part of the central scenario considered by the Monetary Policy Report in September and should lead to inflation falling as from the first half of 2001. The latest data confirms the set of projections given in September's Report, especially the forecast of inflation around 3% within the period and economic activity recovering without generating inflationary pressures. However, the same threats considered a month ago still persist: fuel price volatility, slowdown of the United States economy and domestic demand still growing slowly. The Bank will maintain its flexible monetary policy stance in order to face any threat to achieving the medium-term inflation target."
South Africa,2000-10-16,"A special meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee was convened today to review the effect of recent developments on the outlook for inflation in South Africa. At the end of its previous meeting (21 September 2000), the Committee expressed concern about the second-round price effects of the depreciation in the exchange rate of the rand and the continued high prices of petroleum. Trade statistics that have been released since the last meeting indicate that the surplus on the current account of the balance of payments in the second quarter of 2000 could have changed to a deficit in the third quarter. At the same time non-residents again became net sellers of South African bonds, signalling a possible shortfall on the financial account. As a result of these changes and the continued strength of the US dollar, downward pressure was exerted on the rand with concomitant import price increases, raising the risk of higher inflation. These tendencies were aggravated by continued high levels of international petroleum prices. In view of the likely effects of these changes on future price developments and expectations, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to revise its monetary policy stance. It was concluded that a modest increase in interest rates at this stage may avoid later steep increases in rates in order to meet the inflation target. Consequently, the Committee decided to marginally under-provide in the liquidity requirement of the banks at the daily auction of repurchase transactions tomorrow, 17 October 2000. The Committee is of the opinion that these steps may lead to an increase of approximately 25 basis points in the repurchase rate, but the actual increase will be determined at the repo auctions. The outcome of this position will be evaluated at the next scheduled meeting of the MPC."
Euroarea,2000-10-19,"Welcome address by Jean-Claude Trichet. Governor of the Banque de France. Today, the Governing Council met for the second time outside Frankfurt. Therefore, let me first of all thank our host. Governor Trichet, for inviting us to meet in Paris and for the generous hospitality offered to us. Our meeting was also attended by the President of the EU Council. Mr. Fabius, and European Commissioner Solbes. As usual, we conducted our regular examination of recent monetary, financial and economic developments and their implications for a monetary policy aiming to maintain price stability in the medium term. Following this review, the Governing Council decided to leave the ECB interest rates unchanged. Moreover, we exchanged views on achievements so far and the challenges ahead. Let me briefly report on developments since the last meeting of the Governing Council before turning to our more general assessment. As regards the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, no new data on monetary developments have become available since 5 October. Turning to the second pillar, oil prices and exchange rates remained two important factors under examination. Before coming down somewhat, oil prices had surged again as markets were concerned about the impact of political tensions in the Middle East. Meanwhile, real GDP growth over the four quarters up to mid-2000 has proved to have been very strong. As mentioned at our last meeting, some uncertainty about short-term growth dynamics stems from oil price developments, as is reflected in survey or confidence data. While these indicators have weakened somewhat in recent months, overall they remain at high levels and underlying forces for continued robust growth remain favourable. This is also reflected in little changed bond market developments. As foreseen at the time of the Governing Council meeting two weeks ago, energy price developments have had a strong impact on inflation rates; in September the HICP rate ofinflation rose further to 2.8%, compared with 2.3% in August and 2.4% in July. This development did not come as a surprise and was already taken into account in our considerations on monetary policy action on 5 October. Overall, latest developments underpin the message we stressed on 5 October, namely that monetary policy continuously needs to ensure that expectations remain firmly anchored in the maintenance of price stability, despite current inflation rates. In addition to commenting on more recent developments. I should like to take the opportunity offered by this special meeting to make a few remarks on where we stand almost two full years after the start of Monetary Union and where we see the main challenges. First, the process of monetary policy-making and its implementation has functioned efficiently. Our policy intentions to maintain price stability in the medium term are increasingly well understood by the general public. Second, the euro area economy impressively overcame the negative mood prevailing in early 1999 and has recovered to a state of affairs not seen for more than a decade. Not only has real GDP grown by more than 3 1/2% over the past four quarters, but employment has also increased and unemployment has decreased considerably. Clearly, the external value of the euro stands in sharp contrast with this very positive picture. The undervaluation of the euro is giving cause for concern that it might have adverse implications for the world economy, including the risk to price stability in the euro area that it entails. Adhering to its mandate and following its forward-looking strategy, however, the Governing Council will ensure that price stability can be maintained over the medium term. The confidence of investors in the internal stability of the euro and the positive outlook for euro area growth are contributing to the attractiveness of investing in the euro area and will support a stronger external value of the euro. Looking forward, there are indeed challenges to be taken up by means of appropriate and determined action, but there are good reasons for remaining confident. Monetary policy will ensure that risks stemming from import price developments will not translate into more permanent inflationary tendencies, thereby also helping to preserve steady GDP and employment growth in the medium term. Governments have increasingly come to recognise the benefits of sound public finances and adequate policies over the long term so as not to overburden future generations. While overall budget positions have improved significantly, this has been helped considerably by the relatively low level of interest rates and the strong upturn in growth. These favourable conditions should be used to intensify the process of fiscal consolidation. Governments should demonstrate their commitment to structural budget consolidation by accompanying the forthcoming tax reforms with spending restraint. Governments have also acted in the field of product markets in order to make them more competitive to the benefit of consumers. A favourable impact on prices, growth and employment of opening up sectors to competition has become clear with regard to the telecommunications and energy sectors. The challenge is now to further reduce the level of regulation so as to stimulate activities in other sectors of the economy, too. Governments and social partners have started initiatives to enable labour markets to function more efficiently. The remarkable performance in employment growth in the past few years also reflects an increasing proportion in part-time employment and points to some improvements in labour market flexibility. Further improvements in labour markets can be supported from many sides. The social partners will play a key role by adhering further to a path of moderate wage increases, in line with price stability, and taking into account both productivity developments and the need to reduce the level of unemployment further. Moreover, there is a broad consensus that the larger part of the still high level of unemployment is of a structural nature; this challenge needs to be addressed continuously by policies which remove structural rigidities from the labour markets and which diminish adverse incentives provided by tax, benefit and pension systems. Ongoing structural reform will be particularly important with regard to the changing character of jobs in an economy which needs to be open to rapid advances in new technologies and globalisation. The Governing Council feels that the first 22 months of Monetary Union have been very successful. It is determined to continue addressing the challenges related to monetary policy and is confident that other policy areas will play their part in the overall policy framework of the Community and the euro area. Laissez-moi vous dire combien je suis heureux et fier que la Banque de France ait ete la seconde banque centrale après la Banque d'Espagne à accueillir le Conseil des gouverneurs de la Banque centrale europeenne et son president en notre sein. Nous venons de tenir cette reunion du Conseil des gouverneurs et je voudrais vous dire que nous avons le sentiment, mes collègues et moi-même, et je crois parler au nom de mes collègues qui se sont reunis ce matin ici à la Banque de France, nous sommes très, très fiers d'appartenir à l'equipe monetaire de l'Europe.

Nous formons une equipe très unie, chaleureusement unie avec le sentiment d'une responsabilite importante, chaleureusement unie derrière notre president Wim Duisenberg. Donc. Wim, je voudrais te remercier une nouvelle fois d'avoir, au nom de nous tous, accepte cette invitation, te dire combien nous sommes fiers et heureux, d'avoir pu être les hôtes de cette reunion et combien nous souhaitons t'ecouter maintenant puisque tu viens de presider nos travaux."
Israel,2000-10-23,"October 23, 2000 The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for November 2000 * according to which its interest rate will bereduced by 0.2 percentage points. The Bank of Israel explains that underlying the decision to lower the nominal interest rate for November by this amount was the assessment that inflation in the next few years is in line with the long-term inflation target set by the government, and the decision thus also supports theattainment of the government's other targets without endangering the achievement of the inflation target. It will be recalled that the government decided that interest policy should focus on attaining the inflation target of 2.5 to 3.5 percent for 2001, 2 to 3 percent for 2002, and 1 to 3 percent-arange which is defined as price stability-from 2003 onwards. Setting an inflation target with such a time scale reflects a commitment to maintaining long-term price stability, as part of the strategy of integrating into the global economy. In so doing, it also helps interest-rate policy achieve its objective of bringing inflation into the range defined as price stability and maintaining it at that level, while providing a firm basis for current growth and ensuring its continuity. At the same time it minimizes fluctuations in the rate of interest and maintains economic stability. The Bank draws attention to another aspect connected with the assessment of stability of the inflation environment, and that isthe wide monthly volatility of prices of goods and services, which despite the recent decline in inflation has not changed significantly in the last few years. Thus, for example, the difference between the greatest and the smallest monthly change in the CPI in any given year has remained between 1.3 percentage points and 1.5 percentage points since 1993 (except for 1980) (Table 2). Such high volatility brings with it risks of possible fluctuations in inflation, especially when the annual inflation rate is expected to be relatively low. In this context the Bank of Israel explains that price stability is not only long-term low inflation but also low volatility of monthly changes in the CPI. The Bank again stresses the importance of keeping aclose watch on the risk premium which international capital markets ascribeto Israel's economy-this has risen recently and is currently estimated at between 1.4 percentage points (for half a year) and 2.2 percentage points (for 10 years). The rise in the risk premium, particularly in the light of the continued reduction in interest-rate differentials between Israel and overseas, can have implications for capital flows and the management of the public's assets and liabilities portfolios,and thus for Israel's financial markets. The Bank of Israel again points out in this contextthat the dollar interest rate is the main substitute for the local-currency interest rate because of the present currency composition of the public's foreign-currency assets and liabilities and of capital flows to and from Israel. The Bank of Israel notes again that the assessment of the inflation path for one and more years ahead-currently between 2 and 2.5 percent a year, approximately-against the background of the long-term horizon of the inflation target, is based as always on the Bank's forecasts of inflation, on inflation expectations derived from the capital market, and on the predictions of various private forecasters. In this context, it is estimates of inflation for the next 12 months and beyond that are significant, and not anysingle Consumer Price Index-whether it happens to fall or rise relativelysteeply or by a small amount-nor estimates for any period shorter than one year. Similarly, short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate or in inflation expectations also hold no significance, unless they incorporate elements that may alter the assessments of inflation within the policy horizon-the following 12 months and beyond. The Bank adds that changes in the money supply over time, which are currently consistent with progress towards achieving the inflation target, the development of real economic activity, and fiscal developments, all form part of the basis for assessing current and future interest-rate policy which is aimed at achieving the required convergence towardsprice stability Changes in the Interest Rates of the Central Banks of Israel and the US ISRAEL US Differential between NIS and dollar interest rates* (percentage points) Interest level in December 1998 13.50 4.75 8.75 Changes in interest in 1999 (percentage points) January 0 0 8.75 February 0 0 8.75 March -0.5 0 8.25 April -0.5 0 7.75 May -0.5 0 7.25 June 0 0.25 7.00 July 0 0 7.00 August -0.5 0.25 6.25 September 0 0 6.25 October 0 0 6.25 November 0 0.25 6.00 December -0.3 0 5.70 Interest level in December 1999 (percent, annual rate) 11.2 5.50 5.70 Changes in interest rate in 2000 (percentage points) January -0.5 0 5.20 February -0.4 0.25 4.55 Marce -0.4 0.25 3.90 April -0.3 0 3.60 May -0.3 0.5 2.80 June 0 0 2.80 July 0 0 2.80 August -0.2 0 2.60 September -0.2 2.40 October -0.3 2.10 November -0.2 1.9 Interest level in October 2000 (percent, annual rate) 8.4 6.5** 1.9 * The comparison of interest rates requires reference also to Israel's country risk, which according to international capital markets now ranges from 1.4 percentage points (for half a year) to 2.2 percentage points (for 10 years).

Thailand,2000-10-26,"Monetary Policy Board's Decision on 17 October 2000 The Monetary Policy Board assessed the economic outlook and inflation trend, and expressed its concern on the current Middle East crisis which could have implications on world oil prices. The risk to inflation stems from persistently high oil prices and the baht depreciation against the US dollar. Economic recovery for the year continues due to strong expansion in exports. Current favourable monetary conditions, together with the continuing improvement in the financial sector, will accommodate any pick-up in domestic consumption and investment demand and help sustain the economic growth. Nevertheless compared to the first half of this year, economic growth has slowed down slightly. The MPB projected core inflation to increase in the next 8 quarters due to pressure from rising production costs. However given that the economic recovery is not yet sufficiently broad- based, core inflation is estimated to remain below 35 percent, except in the fourth quarter of 2001 when it may exceed the target ceiling slightly due to the adjustment in value added tax from 7 percent to 10 percent in October 2001. In light of these factors, the MPB therefore decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 15 percent per annum in order to continue to support the economic recovery. Details regarding the assessment of economic outlook, risk factors, and inflation forecasts will be announced at the Inflation Report press conference on 26 October 2000 at 300 pm. Bank of Thailand 17 October 2000."
Euroarea,2000-11-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. It decided to leave the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem unchanged at 4.75%. The interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were also kept unchanged at 5.75% and 3.75% respectively. Starting with the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB, the three-month average of annual M3 growth stood at 5.4% in the period from July to September 2000, unchanged from the three-month period ending in August 2000. While remaining above the reference value of 4 1/2%. M3 growth, reflecting the increases in ECB interest rates since November 1999, has shown signs of moderation over recent months. A further factor to be taken into account is the fact that the growth rate of credit to the private sector increased to 10.8% in September. However, this was influenced by the financing of payments for UMTS licences. The growth rate of total MFI credit to euro area residents remained broadly unchanged in that month. Turning to the second pillar, one issue under consideration was the likely further development in world economic activity and particularly real GDP growth in the euro area. Overall, the outlook for growth of the world economy remains favourable. In particular, as far as the decline in real GDP growth in the United States in the third quarter of 2000 is concerned, this may be seen as the first sign of an orderly slowdown towards more sustainable levels, in line with the projections currently available. More generally, the extended period of rising and high oil prices has increased the uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of recent growth trends. However, by contrast with previous periods of strong and prolonged increases in oil prices, the world economy is less dependent on oil today and inflationary pressures are still being contained. This should help to avoid any sustained negative effect on confidence, and thereby ensure that the impact of high oil prices on growth remains moderate over the medium term. Euro area real GDP has been growing at a high rate for four consecutive quarters, including the second quarter of 2000. Some monthly indicators which extend into, or cover, the third quarter of this year point to a possible moderation in growth rates. In particular, the pace of growth in industrial production appears to have declined somewhat and some survey data have also indicated that there has been a certain degree of moderation. However, survey data remain at high levels and should be underpinned further by positive factors such as high employment growth. There is thus good reason to remain confident that strong growth will be sustained in the euro area. This picture is broadly supported by bond yields in the euro area. They continue to be compatible with market expectations of strong economic growth in the euro area in the medium term and with developments in consumer price inflation, which are in line with the ECB's definition of price stability. We trust that this assessment will also increasingly be reflected in exchange rates. These have clearly lost touch with economic fundamentals and this is posing risks to the world economy. For the euro area in particular the continued undervaluation of the euro vis-à-vis other major currencies is putting upward pressure on import prices. We shall, therefore, monitor exchange rate developments closely. As regards developments in consumer prices, no additional euro area-wide data on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) have become available since our last meeting. In September 2000 inflation rose to 2.8%, mainly as a result of higher energy prices. As I mentioned earlier, inflation rates may remain above 2% for longer than was expected just a few months ago, owing to unexpected developments in energy prices and the past decline in the euro. In order to maintain price stability over the medium term it is important that economic agents accurately perceive the nature of current price developments. In particular, it needs to be recognised that current upward pressures can be successfully overcome if economic agents see them for what they are - namely, one-off or temporary price increases resulting from external factors - and act accordingly. If oil prices do not rise further, as the markets expect, the effects of past oil price increases will gradually drop out of the annual inflation rate. At the current juncture two main considerations should guide expectations regarding the outlook for the euro area economy. First, the Governing Council is committed to maintaining price stability in the medium term. It will continue to assess thoroughly the outlook for price stability in the euro area. Monetary policy will not accommodate inflationary tendencies in the euro area and in this way will make its best contribution to sustainable growth. Second, euro area countries are now in a much better position to withstand the adverse effects of a sharp oil price increase than they were in the 1970s. The Governing Council remains optimistic with regard to the economic outlook for the euro area. This positive outlook needs to be underpinned by responsible fiscal policy-making and by social partners reacting appropriately to the increase in oil prices. Similarly, continued wage moderation is important in order both to contribute to further decreases in the level of unemployment and to maintain a favourable outlook for price stability. It will be equally important for structural reform to be intensified further in order to allow current high growth rates of real GDP and employment to be sustained into 2001 and beyond, without generating inflationary pressure. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to inform you about two further issues decided by the Governing Council today. I should like to inform you that, in the course of next week, the ECB will release an update of the so-called Balance of Payments Book. This annual publication documents the statistical methodologies applied in EU Member States for the compilation of balance of payments statistics and, as such, improves the transparency of the compilation of euro area statistics. In addition to updated individual country chapters, this version includes two new chapters on the compilation and methodological standards for the euro area balance of payments and international investment position. The Book will be published on the ECB's website and hard copies will be available at the ECB. The Governing Council has today also adopted an ECB Regulation establishing transitional provisions for the integration of Greek credit institutions into the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system, as a consequence of the introduction of the euro in Greece as from 1 January 2001."
South Korea,2000-11-09,"While the upward trend of major economic indicators such as production and consumption has moderated, the current account has continued in surplus. Consumer prices fell a little(-0., 3%) on a month-on-month basis in October mainly due to a decline in the prices of farm products, which has served to offset factors making for an increase including the high oil price and rises in public service charges. Despite the announcement of the results of the credit risk assessment of potentially non-viable corporations on November 3, the presence of factors making for instability in the financial markets has not receded substantially. These include concerns over the liquidity risk of some large corporations, the influence of the liquidation of non-viable corporations, and the uncertainties surrounding the implementation of the second round of financial restructuring. Taking this situation in the financial and real sectors into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea today decided to maintain the overnight call rate at around its current level in November, focusing on supporting financial market stability. Along with this, it also noted that banks would be urged to expand their supply of funds to firms in order to avoid deepening the corporate credit crunch in the course of the recent corporate and financial restructuring. In the meantime, the Bank of Korea will do all it can to avoid fund-raising problems for small and medium enterprises associated with those non-viable corporations whose liquidation had been announced."
Chile,2000-11-14,"Santiago. November 14, 2000 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at its current level of UF plus 5% and that liquidity credit lines would also remain unchanged. The Board analysed recent economic developments and the outlook for the next twenty-four months, based on September's Monetary Policy Report. As foreseen. October's twelve-month inflation rate (4.5%) exceeded the upper limit of the target range of 4%. Rising international oil prices since the middle of 1999 have been determinant in the high rate of inflation. Provided that these prices do not exert any additional pressures, inflation should start to go down from the first quarter 2001 and return within the target range by mid-2001, approaching a level of 3% within the policy horizon. Underlying inflation indicators maintain a controlled path within the target range thanks to the behavior of domestic demand. This is coherent with the growth projections for output, demand and exchange rate given in September's Monetary Policy Report. The external scenario is less promising. On one hand, high fuel prices persist and if this continues world growth could well be less than forecast a few months ago. At the same time, financial markets are now more wary of emerging economies, mainly out of distrust of financial conditions in some Asian and Latin American countries. These factors together with the sluggish growth of domestic demand require a flexible and cautious use of monetary policy. The Central Bank will therefore continue attentive to all threats to the inflationary target."
South Africa,2000-11-16,"At a meeting on 15 and 16 November 2000 the Monetary Policy Committee reviewed current and likely future economic developments to arrive at a decision regarding the monetary policy stance. The main conclusions of the committee are summarised in this statement. 1.1 Oil prices continue to affect international economic developments. International crude oil prices remained at levels above US$30 per barrel despite the release by the US of 30m barrels from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and the increase in output by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which intended to maintain the price of crude oil at between US$22 to US$28 per barrel. Uncertainty in the Middle East and the onset of the northern hemisphere winter are factors maintaining the upward pressure on oil prices. 1.2 There are also signs that economic activity in the United States may have started to slow down. The increase in the real gross domestic product of the United States decelerated from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 5,6 per cent in the second quarter of 2000 to 2,7 per cent in the third quarter. Largely as a result of higher oil prices, the overall consumer price index in the United States increased by 3,5 per cent over the twelve months to September 2000. In addition, the labour market remained tight and unit labour costs rose in the third quarter following an increase in remuneration and a decline in productivity growth. The current account deficit also remains high. A downturn in industrial production in the United States could have a negative effect on international commodity prices in general and South Africa's exports in particular. 1.3 A slight moderation is also expected in the growth of the euro area in the third quarter of 2000 after the economy had performed well in the first half of 2000. High oil prices and a depreciation in the exchange rate of the euro have maintained upward pressure on inflation. The twelve-month rate of increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices accelerated from 2,3 per cent in August 2000 to 2,8 per cent in September. In the United Kingdom, real economic growth appears to have moderated as well, but inflation remains under control. 1.4 Economic growth in the emerging-market economies of Latin America and Asia also seems to have abated somewhat. Most countries in these regions recorded lower second-quarter growth than in previous quarters. Inflation generally appears to be under control, except in Indonesia where significant increases have been recorded over the past few months. Inflation rates in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) continued to diverge significantly. The Common Monetary Area members together with Botswana. Tanzania. Mauritius and Seychelles generally managed to maintain inflation rates below 10 per cent, but in the other SADC countries prices continued to rise rapidly. 2.1 Domestic economic growth, which had been subdued in the first half of 2000, seems to have picked up in the third quarter. Estimates made by the Reserve Bank indicate that the growth in production accelerated in all the major sectors, with agriculture and manufacturing in particular performing well. Agricultural output was pushed to higher levels by the late harvesting of a bumper maize crop in the third quarter, and strong internal and external demand bolstered manufacturing production. 2.2 Preliminary estimates indicate that real gross domestic expenditure increased sharply in the third quarter of 2000, after contracting in the previous quarter. Both final demand and inventory accumulation were responsible for this turnaround. Expenditure on durable goods resulted in continued strong consumer demand and there are signs that households have become more prepared to finance their transactions by incurring debt. Fixed investment in the private sector rose further, indicating a more positive outlook for future growth in demand. 2.3 Despite the growth in aggregate production and some moderation in wage increases. STATS SA reports that employment in the non-agricultural sectors of the economy decreased further by nearly 150 000 jobs in the first half of 2000. The low growth in wages helped to keep the increase in unit labour costs down, and thus to contain price inflation. 3.1 The broadly defined money supply (M3) rose significantly in August and September, after actually declining over the seven-month period to the end of July 2000. This development reflects the stronger performance of the economy in the third quarter, leading to an average annualised growth rate of M3 in August and September of 27,8 per cent. M3 nevertheless continued to register single-digit twelve-month rates of increase in the first nine months of 2000. 3.2 Credit extension to the domestic private sector also increased more rapidly in the third quarter of 2000. In July and September, in particular, credit rose at very high rates. However, this rise was mainly due to changes in the method of reporting investments by banks. After allowing for these technical changes, the adjusted annualised growth rate in credit extension to the private sector still amounted to almost 14 per cent from the end of June to the end of September, as opposed to only about 6 per cent in the first six months of the year. 3.3 The borrowing requirement of the non-financial public sector declined from 4,7 per cent of gross domestic product in the first half of the fiscal year 1999/2000 to 2,4 per cent in the corresponding period of 2000/2001. An increase in the surplus of provincial governments and an improvement in the finances of the non-financial public enterprises led to this decline. The national government's deficit remained well-contained. Although fiscal projections provide for increased expenditure over the next three years, this is not expected to have a significant impact on the government's budget deficit. 4.1 Turnover in the bond, share and futures markets has remained brisk since August 2000, following somewhat subdued conditions in the preceding four months. The depth and breadth of the primary bond market were increased by the introduction of stripped bonds by the private sector in September 2000. 4.2 The decline in the yield on long-term government bonds which had been apparent from May 2000, halted from August onwards. Since then bouts of profit taking and fluctuations in non-residents' transactions in South African bonds have contributed to more volatility in bond yields. From 18 October bond yields generally started to move to lower levels, despite the weakening of the rand and a widening of credit spreads globally. This could perhaps reflect lower inflation expectations as well as the low demand for loanable funds by the government. 4.3 From the end of August up to 15 November 2000 non-residents decreased their holdings of South African bonds by R6,9 billion. However, over the same period they continued to purchase South African equities to the amount of R9,4 billion. This contributed to an increase in share prices over this period. On 15 November 2000 the average price level of all classes of shares was nevertheless still 10,7 per cent below the peak on 17 January 2000. 4.4 Although the banks kept their prime and call rates unchanged after the 25 basis point increase in the repo rate on 17 October, other money market rates generally rose somewhat. The rate on six-month negotiable certificates of deposit, for example, rose by 27 basis points up to 15 November 2000. Expectations of future rate increases also heightened immediately after the increase in the repo rate. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET. 5.1 The Monetary Policy Committee's concern that the current account of the balance of payments would change from a surplus in the second quarter of 2000 to a deficit in the third quarter, was confirmed by the statistics that became available after the special meeting on 16 October 2000. This reversal in the current-account balance was the result of a rise in the volume of imports, weaker exports of agricultural commodities, a deterioration in South Africa's terms of trade and a widening of the deficit on the services account of the balance of payments. 5.2 Fortunately this deficit could at first be funded by means of capital inflows from the rest of the world. There was a sizeable surplus on the financial account of the balance of payments in the third quarter of 2000, essentially due to a turnaround of portfolio capital flows from a net outflow in the second quarter of 2000 to a net inflow in the third quarter. These inflows also brought about a further increase in the country's total holdings of foreign reserves to the equivalent of about 16 weeks' worth of imports of goods and services at the end of September. 5.3 As already indicated, the inflow of portfolio capital seems to have slowed down since the beginning of September. This is also reflected in the spreads at which South Africa's foreign currency debt trades. The ten-year US dollar tap-bond of the government, for example, was trading at a spread of around 365 basis points on 15 November 2000, compared with 321 basis points at the end of August and its original spread of 275 basis points when issued in March 2000. 5.4 This reversal in sentiment towards emerging markets and the deficit on the current account put further pressure on the exchange rate of the rand. The nominal effective exchange rate of the rand accordingly declined by about 5 per cent from 20 September 2000 to 15 November 2000. From the beginning of the year the weighted value of the rand has now declined by no less than 10½ per cent. This could have inflationary consequences if it is not countered by other developments. 6.1 The weakness of the rand, a steep rise in the cost of imported crude oil and an upward shift in food prices, were the main factors responsible for a sharp increase in consumer prices excluding mortgage costs (CPIX). The twelve-month rate of increase in the CPIX rose from 6,5 per cent in October 1999 to 8,1 per cent in September 2000. However, if energy and food prices are excluded from this index. CPIX inflation actually declined from 6,8 per cent to 6,7 per cent over the same period. This indicates that there are still no visible second-round effects on consumer prices, arising from these exogenous shocks. 6.2 A number of positive fundamental factors were probably responsible for this favourable inflation outcome. These include low growth in nominal unit labour costs, surplus production capacity, little evidence of excessive growth in domestic demand, moderate growth in the money supply and bank credit extension, prudent fiscal and monetary policies and increased competition as a result of import tariff reforms. 6.3 However, there are signs that the second-round effects of these external shocks are appearing in production prices. Production price inflation, measured over one year and excluding crude oil and food prices, rose steeply from 3,2 per cent in November 1999 to 5,7 per cent in September 2000. Price increases have been recorded in most of the components of the production price index excluding oil and food prices. This could indicate that CPIX inflation will be affected indirectly by external factors in the coming months because increases in production prices normally precede increases in consumer price inflation. The influence on consumer prices will depend on competitive forces in the economy and will be tempered in the medium term by the prudent fiscal and monetary policies. 6.4 The upside risks for inflation are substantiated by the results of an inflation expectations survey conducted by the Bureau of Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch in October 2000. This survey shows that the inflation expectations of the trade union movement increased from July to October 2000. The inflation expectations of the business and finance sector, however, remained largely unchanged. 6.5 In view of the analysis of the present and probable future price developments, and building on the decision of the special meeting of the MPC of 16 October 2000, the Committee has decided to maintain the current monetary policy stance. However the Monetary Policy Committee will continue to closely monitor any further effects of the depreciation of the exchange rate and the continued high prices of petroleum."
Israel,2000-11-27,"November 27, 2000 The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for December 2000, according to which its interest rate will be reduced by 0.2 percentage points. The Bank of Israel explains that the decision to lower the nominal interest rate for December by this amount is consistent with the long-term inflation target set by the government. The decision was taken against the background of the assessment that inflation in the next few years will be between 2 percent and 3 percent a year, close to the lower limit of the target range for 2001, and in the area of the price-stability target set by the government for the medium term. It thus also supports the attainment of the government's other targets without endangering the achievement of the inflation target. It will be recalled that the government decided that interest policy should focus on attaining the inflation target of 2.5 to 3.5 percent for 2001, 2 to 3 percent for 2002, and 1 to 3 percent-a range which is defined as price stability-from 2003 onwards. Setting an inflation target with sucha time scale reflects a commitment to maintaining long-term price stabilityas a major component in Israel's ability to integrate into the global economy. In sodoing, it also helps interest-rate policy achieve its objective of bringing inflation into the range defined as price stability and maintaining it at that level, while providing a firm basis for current growth and ensuring its continuity. At the same time it minimizes fluctuations in the rate of interest, which helps lower volatility in the money, capital and foreign-currency markets and in the rate of inflation, and maintainseconomic stability. The Bank of Israel points out that the price-stabilization process is still exposed to risks deriving inter alia from increased uncertainty in three main areas: firstly, the downward price trend and volatility in the US capital markets, which has intensified recently, raises questions regarding the long-term characteristic of capital inflow to Israel. As is well known, developments in the high-tech industries, which were reflected in rising stock prices in the US capital market in the last few years, encouraged foreign investment in Israeli companies engaged in that field, and this constituted an important source of capital inflow. Second, there has been concern recently regarding the government's abilityto maintain fiscal control, concern which stems from difficulties encountered in obtaining approval of the budget for 2001 and in the approval of private bills which increase government expenditure irrespective of the budget framework. In this context, it is relevant to note that till now these threats have not been realized in the performance of the budget. Third, the continuation of the recent security-related incidents, which have so far had only a slight affect on the domestic financial markets compared with what mighthave been expected based on similar events in the past, presents a new test of the economy's ability to go on integrating into the global economy. These uncertainty factors, however, have not as yet affected the various assessments of the expected inflation path for the next few years. The Bank again stresses that the risk premium whichinternational capital markets ascribe to Israel's economy is currently estimated at between 1.3 percentage points (for half a year) and 2.1 percentage points (for 10 years), a slight reduction from last month's level. The continued reduction in interest-rate differentials between Israel and overseas, taking the risk premium into account,can have implications for capital flows and the management of the public's assets and liabilities portfolios, and thus for Israel's financial markets. The Bank ofIsrael again points out in this context that the dollar interest rate is the main substitute forthe local-currency interest rate because of the present currency composition of the public's foreign-currency assets and liabilities and of capital flows to and from Israel. The Bank of Israel notes again that the assessment of the inflation path for one and more years ahead, against the background of the long-term horizon of the inflation target, is based as always on the Bank's forecasts of inflation, on inflation expectations derived from the capital market, and on the predictions of various private forecasters. It must be borne in mind that it is estimates of inflation for the next 12 months and beyond that are significant, andnot any single Consumer Price Index-whether it happens to fall or rise relativelysteeply or by a small amount-nor estimates for any period shorter than one year. Similarly, short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate or in inflation expectations alsohold no significance, unless they incorporate elements that may alter the assessmentsof inflation within the policy horizon-the following 12 months and beyond.

Thailand,2000-12-06,"Monetary Policy Board's Decision on 6 December 2000 The Monetary Policy Board met today and assessed that despite the world oil price being higher and the baht being weaker since the last meeting, inflationary pressure remains subdued and less than previously estimated. During October and November 2000, headline inflation did not increase, but declined moderately from an average of 22 per cent during the third quarter to 17 per cent in both months, while core inflation stayed at 07-08 per cent. These reflected the fact that the recovery in the domestic economy was still modest. The latest data also indicated a clearer trend of slowdown in the major industrial economies. This may have adverse effects on the rate of growth of world trade and the exports of Thailand, which, in turn, will lessen the pressure on inflation. In light of these factors, the MPB decided to maintain the key policy rate at 15 per cent to allow the economic recovery to further strengthen and will continue to monitor these external developments closely. Bank of Thailand 6 December 2000."
South Korea,2000-12-07,"The possibility of an economic slow-down is gradually increasing. The growth rate of production and consumption declined in September and October. The growth rate of exports has also shown a decline and the current account surplus has been narrowing. Consumer prices eased on a month-on-month basis in November, mainly thanks to the drop in the prices of farm products. However, there are some underlying factors that could push up prices such as the depreciation of the won, high oil prices and increases in public service charges. In the financial markets, despite the announcement of the results of the credit risk assessment of potentially non-viable corporations, the concern over corporate credit risk has not been dispelled and financial institutions' conservative attitude to lending to the corporate sector has not changed. Nor has the partial corporate credit crunch, mainly affecting large enterprises, subsided. The exchange rate and stock prices have been displaying an unstable range of movements due to the increasing uncertainty surrounding the domestic and international economic environments. Taking this situation in the financial and real sectors into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea today decided to maintain the overnight call rate at around its current level in December. In December, an increase in the year-end demand for funds, enlarged portfolio shifts among financial institutions and the maturity of a number of large issues of corporate bonds are expected. In order to avoid deepening the corporate credit crunch, the Bank of Korea will accordingly show flexibility in the management of liquidity and encourage financial institutions to expand their supply of funds to firms."
Chile,2000-12-12,"Santiago. December 12, 2000 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at its current level of UF plus 5% and that liquidity credit lines would also remain unchanged. As usual, the Board analyzed recent economic developments and the outlook for the next twenty-four months. As foreseen. November's twelve-month inflation rate (4.7%) exceeded the upper limit of the target range of 4% whereas underlying inflation continued controlled and close to the mid- range target of 3%. The difference is explained by the direct effect on total inflation of high oil prices in international markets. Provided that these prices do not exert any additional pressures, inflation should start to go down from the first quarter of 2001 and return within the target range by mid-2001, approaching a level of 3% within the policy horizon, in a scenario of moderate but sustained growth of domestic demand and output. The Bank will maintain its flexible monetary policy stance in order to face any threat to achieving the inflation target."
Euroarea,2000-12-14,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Let me first report that the Governing Council decided to reconfirm the existing reference value for monetary growth, namely an annual growth rate of 4 1/2% for the broad aggregate M3. This decision was taken on the grounds that the available evidence continues to support the assumptions underlying the initial derivation of the reference value in December 1998 (and its confirmation in December 1999), namely those for trend potential output growth and the trend decline in M3 income velocity in the euro area. With regard to the assessment of trend potential output growth, there is still no decisive evidence that measurable and lasting increases in productivity growth in the euro area would warrant a significant upward revision in the assumption for trend potential growth. This notwithstanding, the uncertainties surrounding estimates of the medium-term development of potential output growth in the euro area have become skewed to the upside. Against this background, the Governing Council will carefully monitor further evidence with regard to an acceleration of productivity growth in the euro area. The Governing Council also wishes to emphasise that potential output growth could be strengthened by further structural reforms in the labour and goods markets. Naturally, the ECB's monetary policy will take such changes appropriately into account. The ECB will issue a press release today to provide some background information on the review of the reference value carried out by the Governing Council. The Governing Council also conducted its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. It decided to leave the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem unchanged at 4.75%. The interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were also kept unchanged at 5.75% and 3.75% respectively. Starting with the first pillar, it is fair to say that M3 growth rates have shown signs of moderation over the past few months. However, taking into account the protracted upward deviation of M3 growth from the reference value of 4 1/2% and the still robust growth of credit to the private sector, caution continues to be warranted with regard to the upside risks to price stability stemming from the monetary side. As for key indicators related to the second pillar, the assessment is currently complicated by increased uncertainty. In the first place, this applies to tendencies in the world economy. With regard to the evolution of real GDP growth currently foreseeable for the euro area, the underlying dynamism of growth continues to prevail, although subject to some moderation. Developments in euro area bond markets, characterised by a decline in bond yields in November and December, broadly confirm this assessment of growth. In foreign exchange markets, also reflecting the current outlook for global growth patterns, the euro has appreciated against the currencies of the euro area's most important trading partners. The Governing Council considers this development to be a step in the right direction. Turning to consumer price developments, recent developments have continued to reflect, above all, developments in oil prices, but also previous developments in the euro exchange rate. Over the medium term, the upward pressures from energy prices are expected to disappear gradually, while HICP rates of inflation will increasingly depend on domestic forces. On balance, the Governing Council judges the risks to price stability still to be on the upside. The Governing Council will continue to counteract any risks to price stability in the medium term by responding in a timely manner. At the same time, it does stress the importance of all economic actors responding in an appropriate manner to the current oil price-led increase in consumer price inflation. In particular, social partners can rely on the commitment of monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term and they should continue along the path of wage moderation observed in recent years. In the same vein, fiscal authorities should control expenditure growth, as it could otherwise fuel upward pressures on prices. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to inform you about other issues discussed by the Governing Council. First of all. I should like to provide you with information on several issues relating to the euro banknotes and coins. First, pursuant to the Treaty (Article 106 ), the ECB has the exclusive right to approve the volume of coins issued by the euro area Member States. To this end, the Governing Council adopted an ECB Decision on the volume of coin issuance in 2001. This Decision, which also covers Greece for the first time, will soon be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Second, in order to raise citizens' awareness and to prepare them for the cash changeover at the beginning of 2002, the Governing Council agreed to organise a series of conferences on euro changeover issues in the course of 2001. These conferences will bring together the key parties involved in the euro cash changeover process, both at the national and at the European level, with a view to focusing on the cash changeover preparations. This action should also be seen against the background of the Conclusions of the European Council meeting in Nice on 7 to 9 December 2000. Third, the Governing Council decided that tests on the euro banknotes will be carried out in all euro area countries in 2001. These tests will offer companies an opportunity to check and fine-tune their cash and/or vending machines and sensors with regard to their being able to recognise and accept euro banknotes. They will be organised by the euro area national central banks; the Bank of England will also be invited to participate. The ECB will monitor the test scenario in order to ensure a consistent approach and will act as the contact point for companies registered in a country without a test centre. Fourth, further to the ECB's press release of 3 August 2000, when the decisions of the Governing Council regarding the euro area financial modalities for the 2002 cash changeover were announced, the Governing Council agreed on general principles for the so-called frontloading and sub-frontloading of euro banknotes outside the euro area as from 1 December 2001. Today's decision, which complements the principles agreed with regard to the frontloading and sub-frontloading of euro banknotes inside the euro area, has to be seen as a contribution to ensuring a smooth cash changeover in 2002. You will find further information relating to this decision in a separate press release to be issued this afternoon. With regard to TARGET, the Governing Council decided to establish a long-term calendar of TARGET operating days to be applied from 2002 onwards. The establishment of such a common long-term calendar was deemed necessary in order to reduce uncertainties for financial markets. In addition to Saturdays and Sundays. TARGET as a whole, including both domestic and cross-border transactions, will be closed for a total of six days in the calendar year. You will find further information relating to this decision in a separate press release to be issued this afternoon. The Governing Council also adopted several legal acts related to the field of accounting, which will be published shortly in the Official Journal of the European Communities.These acts relate to the legal framework for accounting and reporting within the ESCB, the annual accounts of the ECB and the allocation of monetary income of the euro area national central banks and losses of the ECB for the financial years 1999 to 2001. Let me also draw your attention to some of the decisions taken by the Governing Council at its previous two meetings. By the end of 2001, the ECB will therefore have approximately 1,100 staff members. Second, in connection with the Bank of Greece's entry into the Eurosystem, the Governing Council adopted several legal instruments on the transfer of foreign reserves from the Bank of Greece to the ECB, the crediting to the Bank of Greece of a corresponding claim on the ECB and the contribution to the capital, reserves and provisions of the ECB by the Bank of Greece. These legal acts will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities shortly. Amendments to several other legal instruments were also adopted. Third. I should like to mention that, following the very positive reaction to last year's ""Helsinki Seminar"", the ECB is organising a second seminar with high-ranking officials from the central banks of the EU accession countries. This seminar will be held tomorrow in Vienna, in co-operation with the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, and will focus in particular on issues related to the price dynamics in accession countries, the role of the central banks in managing the accession process and the co-operation between the Eurosystem and the accession countries' central banks. The ""Vienna Seminar"" will be followed by a press conference at 4 p.m. tomorrow. Finally. I should like to inform you that the Governing Council has decided that its next meeting, which is scheduled for 4 January 2001, will be held by means of a teleconference. The press conference originally planned for that day has thus been cancelled."
Israel,2000-12-25,"December 25, 2000 The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for January 2001, according to which its interest rate will be reduced by 0.2 percentage points. The Bank of Israel explains that the decision to lower the nominal interest rate for January by this amount is consistent with the long-term inflation target set by the government. The decision was taken against the background of the assessment that inflation in the next three years will be between 2.0 percent and 3.0 percent a year, slightly below the lower limit of the target range for 2001, and in the area of the price-stability targetset by the government for the medium term. It will be recalled that the government decided that interest policy should focus on attaining the inflation target of 2.5 to 3.5 percent for 2001, 2 to 3 percent for 2002, and 1 to 3 percent-arange which is defined as price stability-from 2003 onwards. Setting an inflation target with such a time scale reflects a commitment to maintaining long-term price stability as a major component in Israel's integration into the global economy. Setting a long-term target also helps interest-rate policy achieve its objective of bringing inflation into the range defined as price stability and maintaining it at that level in the long run, while providing a firm basis for current growth and ensuring its long-term continuity. At the same time it minimizesfluctuations in the rate of interest, which helps lower volatility in the money, capital and foreign-currency markets and in the rate of inflation, and thus maintains economic stability. The Bank of Israel points out that interest-rate policy must adhere to its long-term objectives, and it is not intended, nor indeed able, to offset short-term fluctuations in the economy's current activity, signs of which have been evident in the last few months. Furthermore, the relative stability which is a feature of Israel's financial markets, particularly in the light of the increased volatility of the US capital markets, has been accompanied by greater economic uncertainty deriving from the domestic situation and possible geopolitical changes. On the one hand, the stability shown by the markets allows the cautious and gradual process of loweringthe rate of interest to continue, but on the other, increased uncertainty against the background of the reduced interest-rate differential between the US and Israel-which has contracted from about 9 percentage points two yearsago to 1.5 percentage points today-calls for great caution to be exercised in the pace at which the interest rate is cut and in the frequency of futurechanges. The Bank again notes that the risk premium which international capital markets ascribe to Israel's economy is currently estimated at between 1.2 percentage points (for half a year) and 2.1 percentage points (for 10 years), a slight reduction from last month's level. The continued reduction in interest-rate differentials between Israel and overseas, taking the risk premium into account, has implications for capital flows and the composition of the public's assets and liabilities portfolios,and thus for Israel's financial markets. The Bank of Israel again points out in this contextthat the dollar interest rate is the main substitute for the local-currency interest rate because of the present currency composition of the public's foreign-currency assets and liabilities and of capital flows to and from Israel. In this context it is relevant to note that there has been significant capital inflow into Israel in the last few years, particularly into high-tech industries, based mainly on the rise in prices of high-tech stock in the US capital market. Falling prices in recent months and greater uncertainty associated with the security-related incidents give rise to the currentassessment that capital imports by nonresidents in 2001 are likely to be below their level in 2000, when foreign investments in Israel reached an unprecedented peak. It is also estimated that the current-account deficit in 2001 is likely to exceed that in 2000. The Bank of Israel notes again that the assessment of the inflation path for one and more years ahead, against the background ofthe long-term horizon of the inflation target, is based as always on the Bank's forecasts of inflation, on inflation expectations derived from the capital market, and on the predictions of various private forecasters. It mustbe borne in mind that it is estimates of inflation for the next 12 months and beyond that are significant, and not any single Consumer Price Index-whether it happens to fall or rise relatively steeply or by a small amount-nor estimates for any period shorter than one year. Similarly, short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate or in inflation expectations also hold no significance, unless they incorporate elements that may alter the assessments of inflation within the policy horizon-which is between one and three years forward.
