Romania,2009-01-06,"In its meeting of January 6, 2009, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board is restating that the central bank will continue to closely monitor domestic developments and global economic evolutions so as to adequately adjust its instruments to ensure the achievement of its objectives related to both price stability and financial stability, in the context of a balanced macroeconomic policy mix. The analysis of the latest macroeconomic developments shows a continuation of the disinflation process and a slowdown of economic growth amid lower investment expansion, especially in the construction sector, diminished industrial output and reduced export orders. The elevated uncertainties related to the magnitude of the impact of the international crisis on the Romanian economy are worth noting. In November 2008, the annual inflation rate dropped to 6.74 percent from a peak of 9.04 percent in July, being still above the upper limit of the variation band around the 2008 target. The adjusted CORE2 inflation - calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) as well as the effect of vice tax - has also slowed, its annual rate falling to 6.4 percent in November. On the other hand, the depreciation of the average annual leu-euro exchange rate (9.3 percent in 2008 compared to the previous year) is fueling inflationary pressures. These pressures are likely to remain high as the correction of the external deficit is ongoing and the adjustment of the domestic demand will proceed gradually. As world financial market turmoil has deepened and investors' risk aversion has increased, the volatility of the leu exchange rate has intensified, in line with developments registered by other currencies in the region. The annual increase in real terms of credit to the private sector has moderated under the impact of reduced access of banks to external financing, of a gradual reduction of the excess liquidity in the banking sector, as well as of increased prudence of banks amid growing uncertainties related to the effects of the global crisis on the Romanian economy. The diminished external financing in the context of heightened global financial turmoil, along with increased public spending in the last months of 2008 have triggered a rise in interest rates, which remain at relatively high levels, well above the monetary policy rate. Therefore, the financing of the public deficit in this period, along with a continuation of the lending process require a gradual provision of adequate liquidity in the banking system in a manner that would not encourage exchange rate volatility. Under these circumstances, the consolidation of disinflation and the ensuring of a sustainable financing of the Romanian economy amid heightened international financial market turmoil, require the maintenance of the present monetary policy stance in support of the formulation and implementation of a balanced macroeconomic policy mix. The implementation of the measures announced by the new government aimed at cutting the budget deficit simultaneously with a reorientation of public spending mainly towards investment and job creation are essential to support continued disinflation and a controlled adjustment of the external deficit, as prerequisites for achieving sustainable economic growth. In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to maintain the monetary policy rate at 10.25 percent per annum, to pursue an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system, through the active use of open-market operations, and to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu-denominated and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board is restating that the central bank will continue to closely monitor domestic developments and global economic evolutions so as to adequately adjust its instruments in order to ensure the achievement of its objectives related to both price stability and financial stability, in the context of a balanced macroeconomic policy mix. The next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled on February 4, 2009, when the quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Chile,2009-01-08,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 8 January 2009 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to reduce the monetary policy interest rate by 100 basis points, to 7.25% (annual). This decision is grounded on the prospects of a significant fall in medium- term inflation, due to the drastic change in the macroeconomic outlook. Internationally, credit conditions remain under stress, although there has been some relief in interbank liquidity while financial volatility has diminished. The latest data confirms a severe slowdown of the global economy in the fourth quarter. Commodity prices have remained at low levels. Domestically, available information for fourth-quarter output and demand reveals significant deceleration. Unemployment is stable and tight lending standards persist. The government announced a sizeable fiscal stimulus program. In December 2008, monthly inflation was negative, beyond expectations. Monthly measures for core inflation showed a reduction. Meanwhile, wage dynamics continue to be in line with historical patterns and inflation expectations have fallen. The Board considers that, in the most likely scenario, a process of monetary easing will continue, whose pace will depend on inflation perspectives. Accordingly, the Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy so as to reduce the current high inflation rates to 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2009-01-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 50 basis points from 3.00% to 2.50%. In a related action, the Committee also lowered the interest rates on Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans by 25 basis points from 1.75% to 1.50%. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 50 basis points from 3.00% to 2.50%. Domestic economic activity is slackening at a rapid pace. The sluggishness of domestic consumption and investment has deepened further and exports have decreased significantly owing to the worldwide economic slowdown. The downside risk to economic growth is considered to have been heightened by the persistent financial market unrest including the credit crunch. Consumer price inflation has been decelerating steadily due to the fall in international oil prices and the impact of the economic downturn and the trend seems set to continue for some time. In the real estate market, prices and transaction volumes have continued to decline. There has been some moderation in the instability of financial market price variables such as the exchange rate and stock prices. Firms are nevertheless having considerable difficulties in fund-raising since financial institutions, wary of credit risk, are very conservative in the operation of their funds. Looking ahead, the Committee will do what is needed to improve liquidity conditions and to ward off the risk of a severe slowdown in economic activity."
Nigeria,2009-01-14,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 60 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. JANUARY 14th , 2009 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) met today. January 14, 2009, and reviewed the developments in the foreign exchange market vis a vis Nigeria's external reserves position and macro economic developments. It noted that the preliminary estimate of the GDP growth rate for the end of 2008 was an impressive 68% compared with 62% in 2007. It also noted that inflationary pressure remained high throughout the year and provisional figures indicate that the end December headline inflation was 146% while estimated core (non-food) Inflation rate was at 92%. It also reviewed the developments in the oil market as well as capital flows into the economy in 2008 and the prospects for 2009. MPC also reviewed the recent developments in the foreign exchange market and the depreciation of the naira in the light of decreased supply of foreign exchange vis a vis increased demand. It noted the uncertainties and the speculative pressures in the foreign exchange market. The MPC noted that while it is desirable to allow the exchange rate to adjust in response to market conditions, the CBN remains determined to restore stability to the market. Consequently the MPC decided as follows: 1. In the meantime, the CBN is reintroducing the Retail Dutch Auction System (RDAS), with effect from Monday. January 19, 2009, and will be conducted on Mondays and Wednesdays. We will revert to WDAS at the appropriate time. Bids for the purchase of foreign exchange under the RDAS must be cash-backed at the time of the bid. Funds purchased from CBN at the Auction shall be used for eligible transactions only, subject to stipulated documentation requirements. Such fund shall NOT be transferable in the inter- bank foreign exchange market. Authorised Dealers shall return to the CBN any unutilised funds within five business days after delivery, at the rate of purchase. Purchases by banks on behalf of their customers will be published in the dailies fortnightly. Interest earned on Letters of Credit established and for which settlement has not been effected, shall be repatriated to the CBN for repurchase at the bid rate at the time the funds were purchased. The foreign exchange Net Open Position (NOP) of banks will be reduced from 10% to 5% with effect from Monday. January 19, 2009. CBN remains committed to Section 15 , of the Foreign Exchange (Monitoring and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1995, which guarantees unconditional transferability of funds in respect of loans, and portfolio and foreign direct investments into Nigeria.

Thailand,2009-01-14,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 14 January 2009 Ms. Duangmanee Vongpradhip. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. The global financial crisis resulted in a significant slowdown of growth in industrial economies, which had a marked impact on exports of regional economies and led to a contraction in Thai exports. In addition, domestic demand continued to soften, both in consumption and investment, partly as a result of fragile sentiment. However the domestic political situation, which began to show signs of increasing stability, should help enable the government to implement its economic stimulus measures going forward. Inflation remained low as a result of the significant decline in oil and commodity prices due to weaker global economic conditions and domestic demand. The MPC thus viewed that monetary policy could be eased further to support the economic recovery, particularly as the economy continued to face numerous negative risks, both on the domestic and external fronts, and the impact of fiscal stimulus would take some time to materialize. The MPC therefore decided to lower the policy interest rate by 075 percent per annum, from 275 per cent per annum to 200 per cent per annum, effective immediately."
Euroarea,2009-01-15,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our first press conference of 2009. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Slovakia as the 16th country to adopt the euro as its currency. Accordingly. Mr Šramko, the Governor of Národná banka Slovenska, became a member of the Governing Council on 1 January 2009. Following the adoption of the euro by Slovakia there are now 329 million citizens using the euro as their currency. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to reduce the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by a further 50 basis points, bringing the total reduction since 8 October 2008 to 225 basis points. Today's decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish, owing in particular to the further weakening in the economic outlook. Looking forward, we continue to expect inflation rates in the euro area to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, thereby supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings. After today's decision we consider risks to price stability over the medium term to be broadly balanced. This takes into account the latest economic data releases and survey information, which add clear further evidence to the assessment that the euro area is experiencing a significant slowdown, largely related to the effects of the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil. Both global demand and euro area demand are likely to be dampened for a protracted period. Monetary expansion is moderating further, supporting the assessment that inflationary pressures and risks are diminishing. All in all, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. The Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective of inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. This supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Since September 2008 the financial market turmoil has intensified and broadened. Tensions have increasingly spilled over from the financial sector into the real economy. As a result, economic activity throughout the world, including in the euro area, has weakened further. In particular, foreign demand for euro area exports has declined, and euro area domestic activity has contracted in the face of weaker demand prospects and tighter financing conditions. The survey data and monthly indicators for November and December that have become available since our last meeting clearly point to a further weakening of economic activity around the turn of the year, indicating the materialisation of previously identified downside risks to activity. Looking further ahead, on the basis of our current analysis and assessment, we continue to see global economic weakness and very sluggish domestic demand persisting in the coming quarters as the impact of the financial tensions on activity continues. At the same time, we expect the fall in commodity prices to support real disposable income in the period ahead. Furthermore, the euro area should over time reap the full benefit from the effects of policy measures announced over recent weeks. In the view of the Governing Council, this outlook for the economy remains surrounded by an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty. Overall, risks to economic growth remain clearly on the downside. They relate mainly to the potential for a stronger impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets, as well as to concerns about the emergence and intensification of protectionist pressures and to possible adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. It is crucial that all parties concerned make their contribution to lay sound foundations for a sustainable recovery. For this to materialise as early as possible, it is of the utmost importance to maintain discipline and a medium-term perspective in macroeconomic policy-making, pursuing a stability-oriented and sustainable approach. The significant measures being implemented by governments to deal with the financial turmoil should help to ensure trust in the financial system and to ease constraints on credit supply to companies and households. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has declined substantially since the middle of 2008, when it peaked at 4.0%. As we have emphasised on previous occasions, the significant decline in headline inflation in the second half of 2008 reflects mainly the sharp falls in global commodity prices over the past few months. Looking forward, lower commodity prices and weakening demand confirm that inflationary pressures in the euro area are diminishing. Owing mainly to base effects stemming from the past behaviour of energy prices, headline annual inflation rates are projected to decline further in the coming months, possibly reaching very low levels at mid-year. However, also owing to base effects stemming from past energy price developments, inflation rates are expected to increase again in the second half of the year. Hence it is likely that HICP inflation rates will fluctuate sharply during 2009. Such short-term volatility is, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Looking over the policy-relevant, medium-term horizon, annual HICP inflation is expected to be in line with price stability. This assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term. Risks to price stability over the medium term are broadly balanced. Unexpected further declines in commodity prices or a stronger than expected slowdown in the economy could put downward pressure on inflation, while upside risks to price stability could materialise particularly if the recent fall in commodity prices were to reverse or if domestic price pressures turn out to be stronger than assumed. It is therefore crucial that price and wage-setters fully live up to their responsibilities. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest evidence confirms a moderating rate of monetary expansion in the euro area. Monetary trends therefore support the view that inflationary pressures and risks are diminishing. In analysing monetary developments it should be recognised that the intensification of the financial market turmoil since mid-September has the potential to affect the evolution of monetary aggregates significantly. Recent money and credit data indicate that this has already had a substantial impact on the behaviour of market participants. Both the broad aggregate M3 and, in particular, the components of M3 that are most closely related to the ongoing financial tensions  such as holdings of money market funds  have shown high month-to-month volatility of late. Overall, however, looking to the extent possible through this volatility, the rate of broad money growth continues to moderate in line with the trend established over the past 18 months, with the intensification of financial tensions since September leading to significant substitution among the components of M3, rather than, at least so far, sharp changes in the trend of M3 itself. Turning to the evolution of bank loans, the tightening of financing conditions resulting from the intensification of the financial tensions has contributed to a slowdown in the flow of monetary financial institution (MFI) loans to the non-financial private sector in recent months. More data and further analysis are necessary to form a robust judgement about the severity and scope of credit constraints and their possible implications for economic activity. To sum up, we decided to reduce the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by a further 50 basis points, bringing the total reduction since 8 October 2008 to 225 basis points. Today's decision takes into account that inflationary pressures have continued to diminish, owing in particular to the further weakening in the economic outlook. The Governing Council recalls its operational decision, taken on 18 December 2008, to widen again the corridor formed by the rates on the Eurosystem's standing facilities as of 21 January 2009. Looking forward, we continue to expect inflation rates in the euro area to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, thereby supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings. After today's decision we consider risks to price stability over the medium-term to be broadly balanced. This takes into account the latest economic data releases and survey information, which add clear further evidence to the assessment that the euro area is experiencing a significant slowdown, largely related to the effects of the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil. Both global demand and euro area demand are likely to be dampened for a protracted period. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms this view. Monetary expansion is moderating further, supporting the assessment that inflationary pressures and risks are diminishing. All in all, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. The Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective of inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. This supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policies, the Governing Council welcomes the European Council's reconfirmation of its full commitment to sustainable public finances. In this respect, the current economic situation calls for particular prudence with regard to the adoption of extensive fiscal stimulus measures, taking into account the particular fiscal situation in each country. The operation of automatic stabilisers will provide a relatively large and powerful fiscal impulse to the weakening economy, in addition to already announced expansionary fiscal policy measures and the government support for the banking sector. Taken together, the additional measures decided so far put a considerable burden on public finances in a large number of euro area countries. If not reversed in due time, this will negatively affect in particular the younger and future generations. It is therefore essential to return to a credible commitment to medium-term budgetary objectives as soon as possible. The significant fiscal loosening and the implied increase in government debt should in any case not risk undermining public confidence in the sustainability of public finances, thereby detracting from the effectiveness of a fiscal stimulus. Turning to structural policies, the ongoing period of weak economic activity and high uncertainty about the economic outlook imply the need to strengthen the resilience and flexibility of the euro area economy. Product market reforms should foster competition and speed up effective restructuring. Labour market reforms should help to facilitate appropriate wage-setting, as well as labour mobility across sectors and regions. The current situation should therefore be seen as a catalyst to foster the implementation of necessary domestic reforms in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition."
Peru,2009-01-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2009 BCRP REDUCES RESERVE REQUIREMENTS BY ONE PERCENTAGE POINT AND MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 6.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to reduce minimum legal reserve requirements by 1 percentage point and to maintain the monetary policy reference interest rate at 6.50 percent. This measure is part of the series of policies that the Central Bank has been implementing since September 2008 to provide liquidity to the economy and to face the international financial crisis in order to preserve the normal functioning of the credit market. Inflation showed a rate of 0.36 percent in December and a rate of 6.65 percent in the last 12 months a level lower than the 6.75 percent rate observed in November. Inflation is expected to continue declining in the next months due to the effect of the recent drops seen in the international prices of food inputs and fuels, thus allowing inflation's convergence to the target. The Board continues to oversee the development of domestic demand and of the national and international economic and financial situation, as well as the evolution of inflation and its determinants. The Board also reiterates that the Central Bank will adopt any necessary measures to lead inflation to gradually converge to the target range and affirms its commitment to providing the economy with the required liquidity through monetary instruments. As long as inflation and inflation expectations continue converging to the target range, the Board will also adopt a more flexible monetary stance. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 7.25 percent. Overnight deposits: 5.75 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 7.25 percent. In 2009, the Board will approve the Monetary Program for the next months in the Board sessions to be held according to the following schedule: February 5 March 5 April 8 May 7 June 4 July 9 August 6 September 10 October 7 November 5 December 10 Moreover, in 2009 the BCRP will publish its Inflation Report on the following dates: March 13 June 12 September 18 December 18."
Romania,2009-01-15,"In its meeting of 15 January 2009, the Board of the National Bank of Romania approved the amendments to Regulation No. 11/2008 amending and supplementing NBR Regulation No. 3/2007 on limiting credit risk associated with loans to households. The NBR Board approved the aforementioned Regulation in August 2008 (implemented starting October 2008) with a view to strengthening the prudential framework and improving risk management in relation to household loans amid the ongoing crisis on global financial markets. Furthermore, the NBR stated that it would assess the impact of the Regulation on lending activity in January 2009. The analysis reveals that default rates are considerably lower among debtors with mortgage collaterals compared to other categories (e.g. unsecured consumer loans). In light of these assessments and in order to limit the fallout of the global crisis on the domestic economy, the NBR Board has deemed appropriate to make a distinction between lending requirements on mortgage-backed loans and those applicable to other loan categories, which requires amending the Regulation. Hence, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided that, based on in-depth analyses, lenders would have the possibility to calculate a higher indebtedness level for the borrowers that would have high-quality real estate assets as collateral for their credits. It should be mentioned that, in its capacity as a regulatory and supervisory authority, the National Bank of Romania defines the general framework for risk management in relation to credit institutions and non-bank financial institutions with a view to safeguarding financial stability. However, it is up to lenders themselves to set the actual lending and risk management conditions via their own lending rules, provided that they comply with the NBR guidelines in this field. Under these circumstances, lending developments hinge mainly on lenders' capability to sustainably raise the necessary financial resources and simultaneously on their compliance with prudential principles. The new provisions will enter into force as of their publishing date in the Official Gazette."
Turkiye,2009-01-15,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 15 percent to 13 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 17.50 percent to 15.50 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. is decreased from 11 percent to 9 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 20.50 percent to 18.50 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 16.50 percent to 14.50 percent. Recent readings indicate that the slowdown in the domestic economic activity has further intensified. Latest forecasts suggest that ongoing problems in international credit markets and the global economy will last longer than previously envisaged. Therefore, downward pressures on both domestic and external demand and inflation will continue. Moreover, significant drops in oil and other commodity prices are having a favorable impact on disinflation. The Committee predicts that inflation will be close to the target by mid-2009, and that the probability of undershooting the target by the end of the year has increased. The Committee has judged that moving forward a sizeable portion of the rate cuts envisaged for the coming months would help offset the tightening in financial conditions. The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective. Uncertainties regarding the impact of the problems in financial markets on the real economy remain at high levels. The extent and the timing of a possible future rate cut will depend on the factors affecting inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Hungary,2009-01-19,"1 At its meeting on 19 January 2009, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and reduced the central bank base rate by 50 basis points from 10.00% to 9.50%, with effect from 20 January 2008. Over the period ahead, the Council expects inflation to be below the medium-term target and the economy to suffer a sharp downturn. Data released over the past month indicate that the outlook for the real economy has deteriorated further. Domestic industrial production fell more sharply than expected; and indicators of global economic activity foreshadow a weaker outlook for external demand. As an effect of these factors, it seems likely that inflation will be lower than previously expected. Monetary policy should continue to take particular attention to preserving the stability of the financial intermediary system and to ensuring that capital flows remain balanced, in addition to focusing on inflation and real economic performance. Risks associated with external financing have recently declined gradually, coupled with an improvement in the ability of the financial intermediary system to absorb stress. However, there remains considerable uncertainty, with limited room for monetary policy manoeuvre. The Monetary Council took its decision to ease policy further consistent with the projections of an economic downturn and a sharp decline in inflation. The base rate may be reduced further in the coming months, if capital flows remain undisturbed and the stability of the financial intermediary system is preserved. 3 The Council's assessment of inflation performance in 2008. Although the consumer price index fell significantly over 2008 as a whole, it stayed consistently above the Bank's 3 per cent medium-term inflation target, and, except in the final month of the year, it even remained outside the ±1 per cent tolerance band. The annual average rate of inflation was 6.1 per cent; however, the consumer price index fell to 3.5 per cent in December. Inflation moved above the tolerance band in the second half of 2008. The high rates of inflation in the years 20062007 had in large part been caused by increases in administered prices, closely related to the fiscal adjustment measures. By contrast, in 2008 high inflation was due mainly to cost shocks of global origin, which, however, moderated in the second half of the year. Food and commodity prices rising at extremely rapid rates and with unpredictable magnitude up to mid-2008 played an important role in inflation moving above target. Monetary policy may influence inflation only with a lag  2008 inflation developments were influenced mainly by the monetary policy actions of 20062007. The inflationary effects of rises in food and commodity prices would only have been fully offset by a rapid and drastic tightening of policy. However, first, there was no scope for such action up to February 2008, due to the intervention band and, second, the Monetary Council saw no reason to do so, because of the significant real economic costs involved. The Council tightened policy in an effort to avoid the second-round effects of cost shocks. But the fall in inflation in the period to autumn 2008 was slower than the Bank expected, even after eliminating the effects of the unforeseen cost shocks. One reason for this was that back in 2007, the MNB thought the prospective decline in domestic demand in the wake of fiscal adjustment would lead to a sharp slowing in the rate of inflation. The eventual fall in demand did reduce inflation; however, the magnitude of the reduction in inflation was smaller than expected. And although the Bank continuously pointed out that the potential rate of growth was slowing, the magnitude of this was greater than expected. Consequently, the decline in demand over the period to autumn 2008 did not lead to a significant increase in spare capacity in the economy, and therefore, the fall in inflation had a less pronounced effect. Labour market developments also contributed to lower-than-expected inflation. In its wage-setting decisions, the private sector did not adjust fast enough to the weaker prospects for economic activity, as suggested by unit labour cost data. The sustained high inflation rates of past years may also have kept economic agents' inflation expectations at high levels. In the Monetary Council's view, the easing in inflation in autumn 2008 will continue, and the inflation target may be met in 2009. The Council will be committed to achieving a sustained reduction in inflation. In the future, economic agents taking their price and wage-setting decision consistent with the Bank's inflation target may contribute to the maintenance of price stability."
Georgia,2009-01-21,"21.01.2009: The NBG maintains its main Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) unchanged at 8 Percent The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on January 21, 2009 and decided to maintain its main policy rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 8 percent. The annual rate of inflation in December has decreased to 5.5 percent. As a result the average annual inflation for 2008 stands at 10 percent. The existing risks to inflation have not changed noticeably since the Committee's last meeting. During the first half of 2009 slowdown in inflation is likely to continue. The annual growth rate of the M3 monetary aggregate has risen slightly since the Committee's last meeting. In addition, bank deposits have increased as well, although growth in lending to the economy has not been observed. According to the survey on foreign investment conducted by the National Bank of Georgia, a certain recovery of foreign inflows is expected in the second half of 2009, which should bolster lending in the country. The outlook for global economic growth remains pessimistic. Uncertainty regarding the price dynamics in international financial and commodity markets persists. The NBG will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets with the objective of achieving the inflation target and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee of the NBG will take place on February 18, 2009."
Malaysia,2009-01-21,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 75 basis points to 2.50 percent with immediate effect. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 2.75 percent and 2.25 percent respectively. The Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) is also reduced from 3.5 percent to 2 percent, effective from 1 February 2009. With the heightened downside risks to growth, the magnitude of the reductions in the OPR and the SRR are aimed to be pre-emptive in providing a more supportive monetary environment for the domestic economy. The international economic and financial conditions have deteriorated much more significantly in the recent period. The major industrial economies are now experiencing a recession and this has significantly increased the risks to global growth. The contraction in global demand and trade, combined with the reduction in global commodity prices, has affected the export earnings of many of the regional economies, including Malaysia. These contractionary factors have been exacerbated by the protracted turmoil in the international financial markets. The sharper deterioration of the global economy is expected to have a greater impact on the Malaysian economy. The large decline in external demand has already led to a contraction in exports and a moderation in the pace of private investment activity. In addition, these developments have also affected labour market conditions. Under these circumstances, the urgent implementation of policy measures will be key towards ensuring that the Malaysian economy continues to experience positive growth in 2009. In an environment of moderating growth and the significantly lower commodity prices, inflation has continued to decelerate to 4.4 percent in December 2008. This deceleration is expected to continue with the weaker demand conditions and lower imported inflation. Given that the Malaysian banking system remains fundamentally sound, the Bank's efforts will continue to be directed towards ensuring access to credit to all sectors of the economy, and that the reduction in interest rates would be reflected in lower borrowing costs.

Israel,2009-01-26,"26.1.2009</td> The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for February 2009 by 0.75 percentage points to 1 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for February 2009 will be reduced by 0.75 percentage points to 1 percent. Background conditions Inflation data:The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined by 0.1 percent in December, a smaller drop than the forecasts, which on average had predicted a decline of 0.4 percent. In 2008 the CPI rose by 3.8 percent. The fall in world energy prices continues to play a major role in the reduction of the index, while housing prices continue their upward trend that started in August 2008. In line with the worldwide situation, food pricesdeclined relatively moderately in December. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Forecasters' inflation expectations for one year ahead averaged 0.4 percent in January, whereas expectations calculated from the capital market, which had shown a downward trend, rose in January, and in the last week reached 0.8 percent, slightly below the lower limit of the inflation target range. Forecasters' average interest rate expectations for the next month are for a reduction of 44 basis points, while expectations derived from the capital market are for a reduction of about 50 basis points for February 2009, no change in March, and a moderate rise from April. Real economic activity: This month's data depict an intensification of the slowdown. The composite state-of-the-economy index dropped by 1 percent in December, mainly due to the decline in the exports and in the trade and services revenue indices. The Bank of Israel Companies Survey for the fourth quarter of 2008 confirms the worsening of the slowdown, and shows expectations that activity will continue to fall in the first quarter of 2009. Exports slumped in the last quarter of 2008, at an annual rate of more than 35 percent in dollar terms. Private consumption, which hitherto had remained stable, recently showed a decline. The Bank of Israel adjusted its forecast of growth in 2009 downwards, to a negative 0.2 percent, compared with its previous forecast of a rise of 1.5 percent. The labor market and wages: : The downward trend in health tax revenues compared with the equivalent period in 2007 continued in November and December, indicating a drop in total wage payments, and hence a slowdown in the labor market. The Employers' Survey of the Ministry of Industry. Trade and Labor shows that the reduction in the number of vacancies accelerated. According to the survey, the number of vacancies fell by 45 percent fromits level in the previous quarter, and the balance of employment was negative for the first time since the end of 2003. National Insurance Institute data to October point to a standstill in employment and a fall in the nominal wage in August-October 2008 compared with that in May-July. On the other hand, unemployment trend data for November indicate that the previous level of 5.9 percent was maintained. Budget policy: Government expenditure increased sharply and unexpectedly in December, and exceeded the path consistent with the achievement of a deficit below the ceiling of 1.6 percent of GDP by NIS 4.4 billion. Thus, 12.7 percent of the total expenditure in 2008 was spent in December. The total deficit in 2008 came to 2.1 percent of GDP, above the ceiling. This resulted from a shortfall of NIS 5 billion in tax revenues. Indirect tax revenues were 10.5 percent lower in the fourth quarter of 2008 than in the fourth quarter of 2007 in real terms. Over the same period direct tax revenues were a real 16.1 percent lower than a year earlier. The foreign exchange market:In the period between the monetary policy discussions of 28 December and 25 January, the shekel strengthened by 4 percent in terms of the index of the effective exchange rate (weighted by the volume of trade) and by 6 percent against the euro. The shekel weakened by 2.5 percent against the dollar, which strengthened against mostof the major currencies by an average of about 6 percent. The capital and money markets: Between the interest rate discussions of 28 December and 25 January, the Tel Aviv 25 and the Tel Aviv 100 share price indices rose by 2 percent and 7 percent respectively, while share indices abroad recorded falls. In this period yields on 10-year unindexed Israel government bonds remained steady at about 5 percent. Yields on US government 10-year bonds rose by half a percentage point to 2.6 percent, so that the yield gap between the Israeli bonds and US government bonds contracted somewhat to 2.4 percentage points. Prices of Israeli corporate bonds continued to rise. The Tel-Bond 20 index rose by 5 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 15 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, rose by 0.25 percentage points to 1.9 percent, while the CDS spreads of emerging market countries showed mixed trends. The world economy: Despite some indications of an easing of the situation last month, the recovery of the global financial system seems further away. The large injection of capital by governments into the banking systems in the US, the UK and other countries has not yet stabilized the financial system, nor has it yet led to a significant renewal of credit activity or stimulation of economic activity. Financial statements starting to appear substantiate previous concerns. Economic activity: In the last month already pessimistic growth forecasts continued to decline, and the expected time of recovery is receding. The most recent data indicate rising unemployment and a sharp fall in consumers' and businesses' confidence. The earlierassessment that the emerging market countries would make up for the slowdown in the advanced economies is not being realized, as the forecasts regarding their economies are also becoming much more pessimistic. In order to deal with the recession, governments world wide are undertaking fiscal expansion, with significant increases in their deficits. Inflation: Inflation in the US in 2008 was 0.1 percent, and in the eurozone, 1.6 percent. The ECB and the Bank of England cut their interest rates by half a percentage point this month, and the markets reflect expectations of further cuts. The interest rates of the Fed and the Bank of Japan are at zero levels. The main considerations behind the decision The reduction of the interest rate for February by 0.75 percentage points will help strengthen the economy's ability to cope with the effects of the global economic crisis, the major ones being the impact on demandfor Israel's exports and production, and the significant slowdown in economic activity. The decision serves to encourage real economic activity, contributes to the stability of the financial system, and serves to moderate the downward pressure on prices that threaten to pull inflation below the target range of price stability. The main considerations behind the decision are: Forecasts of growth in the global economy have been reduced significantly in the last month. The effects of the global crisis on real economic activity in Israelare evident, with the data indicating a marked decline in demand and economic activity. World trade, which exerts a major influence on domestic activity, has dropped, and is expected to fall further. Against this background the Bank of Israel has revised its forecast of growth in 2009 to a negative 0.2 percent. Inflation continues to fall. The CPI declined by 0.1 percent in December, the second month in succession with a negative change in the index. Prices of imported commodities, the main cause of the rise in inflation in the first half of 2008, continue to moderate, and some are actually falling. The average of forecasters' inflation expectations for the next twelve months and expectations calculated from the capital market average are below the inflation target range of 1-3 percent a year. Many central banks have cut their interest rates to unprecedentedly low levels, and the capital markets expect further cuts in a number of leading economies. The reductions in the interest rate combined with the other programs being activated by the Bank in the monetary sphere are intended to support financial stability, help cut the cost of credit, and strengthen the economy's ability to handle the fall in demand. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments closely, and will employ whatever additional instruments are necessary to achieve its objectives and thus support the stability of thefinancial system and encourage employment and growth. 26.1.2009</td> The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for February 2009 by 0.75 percentage points to 1 percent. The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for February 2009 by 0.75 percentage points to 1 percent. The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for February 2009 will be reduced by 0.75 percentage points to 1 percent. Background conditions. Inflation data:The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined by 0.1 percent in December, a smaller drop than the forecasts, which on average had predicted a decline of 0.4 percent. The main considerations behind the decision. The reduction of the interest rate for February by 0.75 percentage points will help strengthen the economy's ability to cope with the effects of the global economic crisis, the major ones being the impact on demandfor Israel's exports and production, and the significant slowdown in economic activity. The main considerations behind the decision are:. Forecasts of growth in the global economy have been reduced significantly in the last month."
India,2009-01-27,"Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy - Press Statement by Dr.D. Subbarao. Governor ""This Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy of the Reserve Bank is set in the context of a deteriorating global economic outlook and heightened uncertainty about the global financial sector. In fact, there has been a rapid and marked downturn in the global economic outlook since the Reserve Bank's Mid-term Review in October 2008. The continued bad news from large international financial institutions on a regular basis renews concerns as to when the global financial sector might attain a semblance of stability. India has rapidly integrated into the global system and has linkages with the rest of the world not just through trade channels, but also through two-way movements of capital and finance. As an integral part of a globalising world. India cannot be expected to remain immune to a global crisis of this nature and magnitude; and in responding to the crisis. India has to share the uncertainty on the way forward just like the rest of the world. The Indian economy experienced a cyclical moderation in growth accompanied by high inflation in the first half of 2008-09. There is now distinct evidence of further slowdown as a consequence of the global downturn. The knock-on effects of the global financial crisis, economic slowdown, and falling commodity prices are affecting the Indian economy in several ways. Capital flow reversals intensified in September and October 2008 though they have stabilised since then; international credit channels continue to be constrained; capital market valuations remain low; industrial production growth has slackened; export growth has turned negative during October-November 2008; and overall business sentiment has deteriorated. On the positive side, the headline inflation has decelerated, though consumer price inflation is yet to show moderation; and the domestic financial markets are functioning in an orderly manner. Although bank credit growth has been higher than during the previous year, rough calculation shows that flow of overall financial resources to the commercial sector in the current financial year has declined marginally as compared with the previous year. This was on account of decline in other sources of funding such as resource mobilisation from the capital market and external commercial borrowings. Both the Government and the Reserve Bank have acted to protect the economy from the adverse impact of the crisis since mid-September 2008. While the Government has announced two major fiscal stimulus packages, the endeavour of the Reserve Bank has been to provide ample rupee liquidity, ensure comfortable dollar liquidity and maintain a monetary policy environment conducive for the continued flow of credit to productive sectors. Towards this endeavour, the Reserve Bank has adopted both conventional measures such as, for example, reduction of the cash reserve ratio (CRR), as well as unconventional measures such as, for example, the dollar swap facility for banks.2 Measures aimed at expanding rupee liquidity included significant reduction in the CRR, a special repo window under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) for banks for on-lending to mutual funds (MFs), non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies (HFCs), and a special refinance facility that banks can access without any collateral. The Reserve Bank is also unwinding the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) securities roughly synchronised with the government borrowing programme in order to manage liquidity. In addition, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) is being set up to provide liquidity support to non- banking financial companies (NBFCs). Measures aimed at managing forex liquidity included upward adjustment of the interest rate ceilings on the foreign currency non-resident (banks) [FCNR(B)] and non-resident (external) rupee account [NR(E)RA] deposits, substantially relaxation of the external commercial borrowings (ECB) regime, allowing NBFCs/HFCs access to foreign borrowing and allowing corporates to buy back foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) to take advantage of the discount in the prevailing depressed global markets. The Reserve Bank has also instituted a rupee-dollar swap facility for banks with overseas branches to give them comfort in managing their short-term funding requirements. Measures to encourage flow of credit to sectors which are coming under pressure included extending the period of pre-shipment and post-shipment credit for exports, expanding the refinance facility for exports, counter-cyclical adjustment of provisioning norms for all types of standard assets barring some exceptions, reducing risk weights on banks' exposure to certain sectors which had been increased earlier counter-cyclically, and expanding the lendable resources available to the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), the National Housing Bank (NHB) and the Export-Import (EXIM) Bank of India. To improve the flow of credit to productive sectors at viable costs so as to sustain the growth momentum, the Reserve Bank signalled a lowering of the interest rate structure by significantly reducing both its key policy rates — the repo rate and the reverse repo rate. The statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) has also been reduced by one percentage point releasing funds to banks for credit deployment. The Government has announced setting up an SPV for addressing the temporary liquidity constraints of systemically important non-deposit taking non-banking financial companies (NBFCs-ND-SI). The mechanism would be as follows: The SPV would issue government guaranteed securities to the Reserve Bank. The SPV will, in turn, use the funds to acquire only investment grade commercial papers and non-convertible debentures of the NBFCs. During its appraisal, the SPV will ensure that the NBFCs use the money only for addressing liquidity constraints and not for business expansion. The total support from the Reserve Bank will be limited to Rs. 20,000 crore with an option to raise it by a further Rs.5,000 crore. The facility will be available for a limited period to address current liquidity concerns of NBFCs. The several measures taken since mid-September 2008 have resulted in augmentation of actual/potential liquidity of over Rs.3,88,000 crore, which has significantly improved the liquidity condition. In addition, the permanent reduction in SLR by 1.0 per cent of NDTL has made available liquid funds of the order of Rs.40,000 crore for the purpose of credit expansion. The liquidity situation has improved significantly following several measures taken by the Reserve Bank. The overnight call money rate, which generally hovered above the repo rate during September-October 2008, has softened considerably and has moved towards the lower bound of the LAF corridor since early November 2008. Other money market rates have also softened in tandem with the overnight call money rate. The yield on 10-year government securities has remained below 6 per cent since mid-December 2008. The LAF window has been generally in an absorption mode since mid-November 2008. The liquidity problem faced by mutual funds appears to have eased considerably.3 The Reserve Bank has acted aggressively and pre-emptively on monetary policy accommodation, particularly through interest rate cuts in terms of both magnitude and pace. In the space of just one quarter, the repo rate has been reduced from 9.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent and the reverse repo rate from 6.0 per cent to 4.0 per cent, thereby bringing down both of them to historically lowest levels. The transmission of the policy interest rate signal has been effective in the money and government securities markets; however, the transmission in the credit market has so far been subdued. From the real economy perspective, however, for monetary policy to have demand inducing effects, lending rates will have to come down. Most banks have reduced lending and deposit rates to some extent, but a few have yet to do so. In the Reserve Bank's view, the policy easing done by it in the last few months allows for considerable room for banks to respond more actively to the policy cues. The Reserve Bank has also assured market participants that it will endeavour to maintain the overnight money market rates within the LAF corridor. The Reserve Bank will continue to pursue this stance of ensuring ample liquidity in the market and maintaining the overnight money market rates within the LAF corridor. In order to do so, the Reserve Bank will, as in the past, employ both conventional and unconventional measures. The demand for credit from the banking sector has increased as other sources of funds to the commercial sector have shrunk. Available information (as on January 23, 2009) suggests that the total flow of resources to the commercial sector from all sources, estimated at about Rs.4,85,000 crore during the fiscal year 2008-09 so far, has been lower than about Rs.4,99,000 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. While bank credit has substituted for the shortfall in other sources of funds to some extent, a complete substitution has so far not taken place. The Reserve Bank's Mid-Term Review of October 2008 had estimated real GDP growth for 2008-09 in the range of 7.5–8.0 per cent. Since then the outlook on real GDP growth has been affected further and the downside risks to growth have amplified because of slowdown of industrial activity and weakening of external demand as reflected in decline in exports. Services sector activities are likely to further decelerate in the second half of 2008-09. Keeping in view the slowdown in industry and services and with the assumption of normal agricultural production, the projection of overall real GDP growth for 2008-09 is revised downwards to 7.0 per cent with a downward bias. Pressures on commodity prices have abated markedly around the world reflecting slump in global demand. In the domestic market, inflation in terms of wholesale price index is already below 7.0 per cent, which was projected earlier for end-March 2009 and, as per current assessment, is expected to moderate further in the last quarter of 2008-09. Keeping in view the global trend in commodity prices and the domestic demand-supply balance. WPI inflation is now projected to decelerate to below 3.0 per cent by end-March 2009. Notwithstanding the projected decline in headline WPI inflation, it needs to be noted that consumer price inflation is yet to moderate and the decline in inflation expectations has not been commensurate with the sharp fall in WPI inflation. However, with WPI inflation having moderated significantly, consumer price inflation would also decline, though with a lag. Towards its policy endeavour of ensuring price stability with well-anchored inflation expectations, the Reserve Bank will take into account the behaviour of all the price indices and their components. Given the uncertain outlook of resource availability from both external and non-bank domestic sources, the Reserve Bank has raised its indicative projection of the total flow of credit from the banking sector to the commercial sector to 24 per cent for 2008-09 from 20 per cent envisaged in the Annual Policy Statement. With a view to enabling banks to sustain the current level of credit flow alongside an enhanced government market borrowing programme, the Reserve Bank's monetary operations will be conducted so as to be consistent with the revised indicative money supply projection of 19.0 per cent for 2008-09, higher than the 16.5- 17.0 per cent envisaged in the Annual Policy Statement.4 To arrest the moderation in economic growth, it is critical that banks expand the flow of credit to productive sectors of the economy and do so at viable rates. At the same time, banks should monitor their loan portfolios and take early action to prevent delinquencies down the road, and safeguard the gains of last several years in improving asset quality. The Reserve Bank appreciates that risk management is a difficult task in normal circumstances; it is even more challenging in an environment of uncertainty and downturn. Towards this shared endeavour of maintaining the flow of credit to productive sectors, the Reserve Bank will take calibrated monetary policy actions as necessary and at the appropriate time. Although the origins of the crisis are common around the world, the crisis has impacted different economies differently. Importantly, in advanced economies where it originated, the crisis spread from the financial sector to the real sector. In emerging economies, the transmission of external shocks to domestic vulnerabilities has typically been from the real sector to the financial sector. Countries have responded to the crisis depending on their specific country circumstances. In particular, while policy responses in advanced economies have had to contend with both the financial crisis and recession, in India, the policy response has been predominantly driven by the need to arrest moderation in economic growth. Our ability to respond has been facilitated by the continued smooth functioning of our financial markets and the well-capitalised and healthy banking system. Thus, even as policy responses across countries are broadly similar, their precise design, quantum, sequencing and timing have varied. This has been the case with India too. While we have certainly studied and evaluated measures taken by other central banks around the world, we have calibrated and designed our responses keeping in view India's specific economic context. In taking a view of the overall outlook, it should be remembered that at the heart of the global financial crisis lie the non-functional and frozen financial markets. In sharp contrast to their international counterparts, the financial system in India has been resilient and stable. Barring some tightness in liquidity during mid-September to early October, the money, foreign exchange and government securities markets have been orderly as reflected in the market rates, spreads and transaction volumes relative to those observed during normal times. India's banking system remains healthy, well-capitalised, resilient and profitable. Credit markets have been functioning well and bank credit has expanded. However, bank credit expansion has not fully offset the shortfall in total flow of resources to the commercial sector. Over the last five years. India clocked around 8.8 per cent average annual growth, driven largely by domestic consumption and investment even as the share of net exports rose. While the benign global environment, easy liquidity and low interest rates helped, at the heart of India's growth have been its growing entrepreneurial spirit and rise in productivity. These fundamental strengths continue to be in place. Nevertheless, the global crisis will dent India's growth trajectory as investments and exports slow. Clearly, there is a period of painful adjustment ahead of us. However, once the global economy begins to recover. India's turnaround will be sharper and swifter, backed by our strong fundamentals and the untapped growth potential. Meanwhile, the challenge for the Government and the Reserve Bank is to manage the adjustment with as little pain as possible. Based on the assessment of the global scenario and domestic economy, particularly the outlook on growth and inflation, the stance of monetary policy for the rest of 2008-09 will be as follows: Provision of comfortable liquidity to meet the required credit growth consistent with the overall projection of economic growth. Respond swiftly and effectively with all possible measures as warranted by the evolving global and domestic situation impinging on growth and financial stability. Ensure a monetary and interest rate environment consistent with price stability, well- anchored inflation expectations and orderly conditions in financial markets.5 Given the uncertain outlook on the global crisis, it is difficult to precisely anticipate every development. The Reserve Bank will continue to maintain vigil, monitor domestic and global developments, and take swift and effective action to minimise the impact of the crisis and restore the economy to its potential growth path with price stability. The response to the Reserve Bank's policy actions over the last several months is still unfolding. As demonstrated in the recent past, the Reserve Bank will act swiftly and decisively as and when evolving external and domestic conditions so warrant. Consistent with the above assessment and the monetary policy stance, it has been decided to maintain the policy rates and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) at the current level. Two liquidity facilities, viz., the special refinance facility under Section 17(3B) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 introduced on November 1, 2008 and the special term repo facility for enabling banks to meet the funding requirements of MFs. NBFCs and HFCs, which are currently available up to June 30, 2009, have been extended up to September 30, 2009."" G. Raghuraj Deputy General Manager Press Release : 2008-2009/1164."
Poland,2009-01-27,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 27 January 2009 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 27 January 2009 The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates by 0.75 percentage points: (cid:131) reference rate to 4.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate to 5.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate to 2.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate to 4.50% on an annual basis. Data that have been released recently confirm that the economic growth in Poland has been slowing considerably. Stronger than previously expected economic slowdown is mainly driven by an unexpectedly strong decline in economic growth abroad, mainly in countries being Poland's major trading partners. This results in deteriorating expectations of economic agents (both enterprises and consumers). Limited credit availability stemming from considerable tightening of banks' lending conditions is also conducive to the economic slowdown. Despite increased excess liquidity of the banking sector, the cost of credit remains at a relatively high level which results from high risk premium incorporated in market interest rates and from increased margins. At the same time, information on labour market developments points to declining employment, increasing unemployment and decelerating wage growth in the enterprise sector which is conducive to diminishing inflationary pressure. Since the Council's meeting in December growth forecasts for the global economy have been further revised downwards. Strong slowdown in the global economy and the accompanying faster than expected decline in inflation, have urged many central banks to further considerably decrease interest rates. The renewed deepening of the banking crisis in the developed countries and the resulting outflow of capital from the emerging economies contribute to further depreciation of those countries' currencies. In December 2008 the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland decreased again (to 3.3%). Inflation remained above the NBP inflation target of 2.5%, yet, in line with expectations, fell below the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. Decline in inflation was mainly driven by falling fuel prices. Yet, the majority of core inflation indices decreased as well. Earlier rises in the prices of energy products and services related to flat maintenance remained major factors contributing to annual inflation persisting at an elevated level. In the Council's assessment, in the coming months inflation will continue to decline to the NBP inflation target. In the medium term stronger than previously expected slowdown in the global economy  in particular, the recession in Poland's major trading partners  and, consequently, the significant decline in domestic economic growth will contribute to lowering the inflationary pressure in Poland. Decreasing GDP growth and the related falling labour demand as well as deteriorating financial condition of enterprises will contribute to further easing the wage pressure. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. Significant tightening of banks' lending conditions will also contribute to curbing the inflationary pressure. Factor limiting the decline in inflation may include significant zloty depreciation observed in the past few months, although its impact on inflation may be limited amidst the economic slowdown. Further rise in regulated prices, mainly the prices of electricity, will also drive price increases. The Council assessed the probability of inflation running below the target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running above the target and decided to lower the NBP interest rates. The easing of monetary policy should contribute to stabilising economic growth around potential output growth which, in the medium term, will support the achievement of the inflation target. The Council's decisions in the coming months will take account of the incoming information on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland and abroad. Maintaining fiscal discipline in the public finance sector may be conducive to easing the monetary policy. The Council will analyse the impact of developments in the domestic interbank market on the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Poland. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts necessary for the euro adoption in Poland. The Council approved The Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland in 2008 Q3."
Philippines,2009-01-28,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to reduce, effective immediately, the BSP's key policy interest rates by 50 basis points to 5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 7 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also adjusted accordingly. This rate cut follows the reduction in policy rates that was implemented in December last year. The Monetary Board based its decision on the latest inflation outlook which shows inflation falling within the target range for 2009 and 2010. The Board noted that the balance of risks to inflation is tilted to the downside due to the softening prices of commodities, the slowdown in core inflation, significantly lower inflation expectations, and moderating demand. However, some upside risks to inflation remain, including the volatility in oil prices and in exchange rates.Given the improved inflation outlook, the Monetary Board believes that there is room for further easing in the monetary policy stance, which should also provide support to financial markets and the real economy. Monetary easing could help promote the smooth functioning of the financial system through easier access to liquidity and credit, and in the process also shore up market confidence. The Monetary Board accordingly encouraged banks to pass on the reduction in policy rates to their lending rates.The Monetary Board also noted that weak conditions in major economies are weighing down on the country's economic performance through their impact on trade, investment and consumption. In this regard, monetary policy easing will complement the fiscal stimulus, which includes accelerated infrastructure spending and targeted social programs. Monetary policy will continue to be focused on the price stability objective, while being mindful of the liquidity and credit requirements of the economy."
United States,2009-01-28,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. Information received since the Committee met in December suggests that the economy has weakened further.Industrial production, housing starts, and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending.Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly.Conditions in some financial markets have improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial institutions; nevertheless, credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight.The Committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, but the downside risks to that outlook are significant. In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months and the prospects for considerable economic slack, the Committee expects that inflation pressures will remain subdued in coming quarters.Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term. The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.The focus of the Committee's policy is to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level.The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the purchase program as conditions warrant.The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.The Federal Reserve will be implementing the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and economic activity and help to preserve price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Charles L Evans; Donald L Kohn; Dennis P Lockhart; Kevin M Warsh; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against was Jeffrey M Lacker, who preferred to expand the monetary base at this time by purchasing U.S. Treasury securities rather than through targeted credit programs."
Romania,2009-02-04,"In its meeting of February 4, 2009, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The annual inflation rate was 6.3 percent at the end of 2008, down from a peak of 9.04 percent in July 2008 and as compared to 6.57 percent in December 2007. However, the annual inflation rate continues to stay above the upper limit of the variation band around the target. The resumption and consolidation of the disinflation process were the result of favourable dynamics of volatile prices (fuel and food items), as well as of the implementation of monetary policy. Nevertheless, the loosening of wage and fiscal policies in the 2008 electoral year along with a depreciation of the national currency amid heightened investor risk aversion have fed inflationary pressures. Thus, the adjusted annual CORE2 inflation rate - calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) as well as the effect of vice tax - stood at 6.3 percent in December 2008. The effects of the global financial and economic crisis are increasingly reflected by the reduction of both exports and external financing, an increased volatility on the domestic foreign exchange market, in line with regional trends and by lack of investor risk appetite. Data analysis show that the impact of these developments is already seen in a slowdown of credit to the private sector with knock-on effects on economic growth, while a high degree of uncertainty regarding their magnitude still persists. The continuation of sustainable intermediation of the economy amid diminished access of banks to external financing and the need to finance the budget deficit required further provision of liquidity in the banking sector, without amplifying the leu's exchange rate volatility. In this context and in line with available data, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 10.00 percent per annum from 10.25 percent. As a result, starting February 5, 2009, the rate on the deposit facility will fall to 6.00 percent per annum from 6.25 percent and the rate on the credit facility (Lombard) will be 14.00 percent per year versus 14.25 percent. Meanwhile, the penalty rate for deficits of leu-denominated minimum reserve requirement, will drop to 21.00 percent starting with February 24-March 23, 2009 maintenance period from 21.25 percent at present. The NBR Board has also decided to continue to pursue an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system through the active use of open-market operations and to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu-denominated and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses the recent macroeconomic environment and the inflation outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The perspectives shows a continuation of the disinflation process, though the outlook is gripped by the persistence of major uncertainties related to the volatility of the internal and external macroeconomic developments. Thus, the consolidation of disinflation amid the starting of an orderly adjustment of the external imbalance in line with the evolution of capital flows, as well as regaining investors' confidence and securing a sustainable financing of the Romanian economy require the configuration and implementation of a balanced and prudent macroeconomic policy mix. The NBR Board is restating that it will continue to monitor domestic and global economic developments so as to ensure, through an adequate use of its available instruments, in order to fulfil its objectives in what concerns attaining and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as safeguarding financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for February 6, 2009, along with a 12-month calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues."
Czech Republic,2009-02-05,"Press Conference of the CNB Bank Board 1st Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 5 February 2009 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided by a majority vote to decrease the CNB two-week repo rate by 0.50 percentage point to 1.75 %, effective 6 February 2009. At the same time it decided to decrease the discount rate and Lombard rate by the same amount, to 0.75 % and 2.75 % respectively. Four members voted in favour of this decision, one member voted for decreasing rates by 0.25 percentage point, and one member voted for decreasing rates by 0.75 percentage point. Message ooff tthhee ffoorreeccaasstt Headline (and monetary-policy relevant) inflation will drop this year towards zero values but it will start rising at the end of the year and approach the 2% inflation target in the first half of 2010. The domestic economic growth will sharply decelerate, forecasted growth is zero or slightly negative this year and around 1% in the next year. The nominal exchange rate will initially correct its depreciation observed at the beginning of 2009 and will be broadly stable thereafter. Consistent with the forecast is a decline in market interest rates. The main aim of this change is to further increase the transparency, clarity and predictability of monetary policy. Identically to the forecast for other key variables, the exchange rate forecast is published as a fan chart. The published trajectory is conditional on the assumptions of the forecast and on information available at the time it was prepared. It can not be considered a commitment or preferred trajectory from the CNB's point of view. Forecast of exports, investment and household consumption is revised downwards accordingly. Compared to the previous forecast, the forecast for both headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation is markedly lower in 2009 whereas in 2010 is roughly the same. Compared to the previous forecast, the interest rate path lies slightly higher in 2009 but, on the contrary, lower in 2010.

Euroarea,2009-02-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, at today's meeting the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. As anticipated in our interest rate decision of 15 January 2009, the latest economic data and survey information confirm that the euro area and its major trading partners are undergoing an extended period of significant economic downturn, and that accordingly both external and domestic inflationary pressures are diminishing. We continue to expect inflation rates in the euro area to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. This assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term. It is also confirmed by the further deceleration in monetary and credit growth in the euro area. Fully in line with its primary objective, the Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in accordance with its definition of price stability, that is inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Reflecting the impact of the intensified and broadened financial market turmoil, economic activity throughout the world, including in the euro area, has weakened substantially. Foreign demand for euro area exports has declined, and domestic factors, notably very low confidence and tight financing conditions, have adversely affected domestic demand. Taken together with other available economic data for the euro area, this points to very negative quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the last quarter of 2008. This information is in line with our current analysis and forward-looking assessment. We continue to see persistent weakness in economic activity in the euro area over the coming quarters, as the financial market tensions have a further impact on the global and domestic economy. At the same time, the very substantial fall in commodity prices seen since the middle of 2008 should support real disposable income, and thus consumption, in the period ahead. Most recently, there have been tentative signs of stabilisation in some survey data, albeit at historically low levels. These indications, however, require confirmation on a broader basis. In the view of the Governing Council, the outlook for the economy remains surrounded by an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty. Overall, risks to economic growth remain clearly on the downside. They relate mainly to the potential for a stronger impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets, as well as to concerns about the emergence and intensification of protectionist pressures and to possible adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. Over time, the euro area should reap the benefit of the effects of significant policy measures that have been decided upon over recent months to deal with the financial turmoil. They should help to restore trust in the financial system and to ease constraints on credit supply to companies and households. In order to ensure that such measures effectively support a sustainable recovery, it is of the utmost importance that they remain focused and temporary in nature so as to maintain a stability-oriented and medium-term perspective in macroeconomic policy-making. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation continued to decline in January 2009, falling to 1.1%, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, from 1.6% in December 2008. While no detailed breakdown for HICP developments in January is available as yet, the decline in headline inflation observed since the middle of 2008 primarily reflects the sharp falls in global commodity prices over this period, owing mainly to weak global demand. Looking ahead, lower commodity prices and the prospect of weak demand confirm our assessment of mid-January that inflationary pressures in the euro area are diminishing. Owing mainly to base effects stemming from the past behaviour of energy prices, headline annual inflation rates are projected to decline further in the coming months, possibly reaching very low levels at mid-year. However, also owing to base effects stemming from past energy price developments, inflation rates are expected to increase again in the second half of the year. Accordingly, it is likely that HICP inflation rates will fluctuate sharply during 2009. Such short-term volatility is, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Looking over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, annual HICP inflation is expected to be in line with price stability. This assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term. Regarding risks to price stability over the medium term, unexpected further declines in commodity prices or a stronger than expected slowdown in the economy could put downward pressure on inflation, while upside risks to price stability could materialise, particularly if the recent fall in commodity prices were to reverse or if domestic price pressures turn out to be stronger than assumed. It is therefore crucial that price and wage-setters fully live up to their responsibilities. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest evidence confirms a continued deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion in the euro area, supporting the view that inflationary pressures are diminishing. In analysing monetary developments it should be recognised that the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil since September 2008 has the potential to affect the evolution of monetary aggregates significantly. It has already had a substantial impact on the behaviour of market participants, as indicated by recent money and credit data. Both the broad aggregate M3 and, in particular, the components of M3 that are most closely related to the ongoing financial tensions  such as holdings of money market funds  have shown high month-to-month volatility of late. Overall, looking to the extent possible through this volatility, the underlying pace of broad money expansion continues to decelerate gradually from the peak seen in early 2007. However, the intensification of financial tensions since September 2008 is leading to significant substitution among the components of M3. Turning to the evolution of bank credit, the flow of MFI loans to the private sector moderated in the course of 2008, largely on account of weakness in loans to households, especially for house purchase. In December, however, outstanding MFI loans to non-financial corporations contracted for the first time since the onset of the financial turmoil, confirming the significant weakening of corporate credit at the end of the year after a long period of dynamic growth. At the same time, the substantial reduction in key ECB interest rates since October 2008 appears to have been passed through to lower bank lending rates, thereby easing financing conditions for companies and households. Moreover, there are some indications that the pace of tightening of bank credit standards is stabilising, albeit at high levels by historical standards. Overall, the incoming information on financing conditions requires continuous close monitoring. To sum up, as anticipated in our interest rate decision of 15 January 2009, the latest economic data and survey information confirm that the euro area and its major trading partners are undergoing a period of significant economic downturn, and that accordingly both external and domestic inflationary pressures are diminishing. We continue to expect inflation rates in the euro area to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. This assessment is supported by available indicators of inflation expectations for the medium term. It is also confirmed by a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis, against the background of a further deceleration in monetary and credit growth in the euro area. Fully in line with its primary objective, the Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in accordance with its definition of price stability, that is inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Turning to fiscal policy, the European Commission projects in its January 2009 interim forecast a substantial rise in the average euro area government budget deficit, to 4.0% of GDP this year, from 1.7% in 2008. This rapid deterioration of the fiscal position is broad-based among euro area countries and is due to the economic downturn, additional revenue shortfalls and the fiscal stimulus measures adopted by many governments. In 2009 seven euro area countries are currently expected by the Commission to exceed the 3% of GDP reference value for the budget deficit. In addition, many governments have assumed large contingent liabilities in connection with the guarantees provided to banks and will need to finance the capital injections in support of the financial sector. To support the public's confidence in the sustainability of public finances, it is therefore essential that governments return to a credible commitment to medium-term budgetary objectives as soon as possible. As regards structural policies, it is important to continue on the long-term reform path foreseen by the Lisbon agenda. At the current juncture, it is essential to pursue economic policies in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition, resisting any protectionist pressure. Moreover, product and services market reforms should foster competition and help to speed up effective restructuring. Labour market reforms should help to facilitate appropriate wage-setting, as well as labour mobility across sectors and regions. This will be particularly important for those areas and sectors hit strongly by the negative demand shock. In several countries, it is also crucial to take measures with a view to addressing competitiveness losses accumulated over recent years."
South Africa,2009-02-05,"Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), domestic inflation has continued on its downward trend. A further decline is expected in the January data when the reweighting and rebasing of the CPI index implemented by Statistics South Africa comes into effect. With respect to economic growth, the domestic economy is being adversely affected by the continuing turbulence in the global economy. The widening domestic output gap and declining international commodity prices are expected to exert further downward pressure on inflation going forward. Nevertheless some risks to the inflation outlook remain and the MPC had to assess these conflicting risks against the backdrop of a highly uncertain and volatile international environment. CPIX inflation (headline inflation excluding mortgage interest cost) has been moderating consistently since August 2008 when it measured 13,6 per cent. In November and December 2008 inflation had declined to 12,1 per cent and 10,3 per cent respectively. Electricity, food, and clothing and footwear prices were the main contributors to the inflation outcomes in these months, having increased at year-on-year rates in excess of 15 per cent. Petrol prices increased by 25,8 per cent in November, but declined by 1,8 per cent in December. If food and petrol were excluded. CPIX inflation would have measured 8,7 per cent in December. Producer price inflation also moderated in the past two months, declining to a year-on-year rate of 11,0 per cent in December. Food price increases continued to moderate: agricultural product prices were unchanged in December, while manufactured food price inflation declined to a year-on-year rate of 12,8 per cent in the same month. The most recent central forecast of the Bank is similar to that presented to the MPC in December. Partly as a result of the reweighting and rebasing of the new targeted inflation index. CPI inflation is expected to decline further and average 7,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2009, and to decline to below the upper end of the inflation target range during the third quarter of the year when it is expected to average 5,2 per cent. Inflation is then forecast to increase again and to breach the upper end of the target range in the first quarter of 2010, mainly as a result of technical base effects. Thereafter inflation is expected to return to within the target range and remain there until the end the forecast period when it is expected to average 5,5 per cent. The simulation results of the model make provision for the most recent trends of actual and preliminary data that have become available from Statistics South Africa since the previous MPC meeting. Market indicators also reflect a moderation in expected inflation. Inflation expectations as measured by the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation-linked bonds have remained within the inflation target range. The Reuters consensus survey conducted in December indicates that analysts expect inflation to average 6,4 per cent in 2009 and 5,8 per cent in 2010. The volatile exchange rate of the rand continues to pose the main upside risk to the inflation outlook. The rand is currently trading against the US dollar at levels similar to those prevailing at the time of the previous MPC meeting. During December 2008 the rand appreciated against the US dollar and reached a level of R9,30 in the first week of January. This move was mainly a result of a weaker US dollar which depreciated to US$1,47 against the euro. Renewed risk aversion in international markets and a stronger US dollar in January resulted in the rand returning to current levels of around R10,00. The rand has appreciated marginally on a trade-weighted basis since the previous meeting. The risks to the inflation outlook posed by oil and food prices appear to have subsided somewhat. Food prices continued to moderate at the production price level but these favourable developments have not yet been seen at the consumer price level. Spot and futures prices of maize and wheat remain well below the average price level in 2008 and some relief at the consumer price level is expected in the coming months. The price of Brent crude oil, which reached a low of US$34 per barrel during December 2008, averaged around US$41 for the month. This, along with the termination of the slate levy, allowed for a further reduction in domestic petrol prices of R1,34 per litre in January. However, international oil prices recovered somewhat in January and averaged almost US$45 per barrel during that month. As a consequence, the domestic price of petrol was increased by 61 cents per litre in February. The outlook for oil prices remains uncertain, but prices are expected to remain relatively subdued as a result of weakening global growth. The domestic economy continues to show signs of slowing, following the 0,2 per cent annualised growth recorded in the third quarter of 2008. The composite leading and coincident business cycle indicators of the Bank point to a continuation of this trend. Other high frequency indicators are consistent with this outlook. The physical volume of manufacturing production declined at a year-on-year rate of 4,4 per cent in November 2008, while the latest Investec/BER Purchasing Managers Index indicates that the outlook for the manufacturing sector remains negative. The utilisation of production capacity in manufacturing declined by 3,4 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 82 per cent. Mining output contracted by 6,1 in November compared to the previous year, while the real value of total building plans approved declined by 25,3 per cent over the same period. Household consumption expenditure also remains under pressure. Real wholesale trade sales increased slightly in the year to November 2008, but real retail sales declined by 4 per cent over the same period. Motor vehicle sales contracted at a year-on-year rate of 35,4 per cent in January, with commercial vehicles sales declining by 41 per cent. Motor vehicle exports, which remained strong in 2008, also moderated and the industry expects larger declines in the coming months. Exports in general are expected to remain under pressure given the adverse global conditions. However preliminary data indicates that the deficit on the trade account of the balance of payments probably contracted during the final quarter of 2008. Household consumption expenditure may also be affected by remuneration trends and employment growth. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the level of wage settlements for the year 2008 amounted to 9,8 per cent, compared to an average inflation rate of 11,3 per cent. Nominal unit labour cost increases in the third quarter of 2008 measured 12,4 per cent. Employment growth has also been impacted by the slowing economy. In the third quarter of 2008, non-agricultural employment increased by one per cent, compared to 3,9 per cent in the first quarter of that year. Private sector employment contracted in the second and third quarters. The subdued trend in household consumption expenditure and the stricter credit criteria applied by banks to both households and corporates have been reflected in a further moderation in the growth of credit extension to the private sector. Growth over twelve months in total loans and advances by banks to the private sector declined to 14,4 per cent in December 2008. Most categories of loans have exhibited declines in growth. High consumption expenditure is expected to remain under pressure from negative wealth effects resulting from adverse asset price developments. The all-share index on the JSE Limited remained volatile in line with global market turbulence. The housing market has also remained subdued, with the various house price indices indicating real price declines. The outlook for the world economy has deteriorated further as a result of the continued difficulties being experienced by the global financial system. The International Monetary Fund significantly downgraded its forecast for global growth in 2009 to 0,5 per cent. Many of the advanced economies are expected to experience negative growth rates in the coming months, while growth prospects of emerging market and developing economies have also deteriorated. As a result of these widening output gaps and declining commodity prices, world inflation pressures have subsided. The Monetary Policy Committee has decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 100 basis points to 10,5 per cent per annum with effect from 6 February 2009. The MPC will continue to monitor domestic and global developments in order to decide on the most appropriate monetary policy stance going forward."
Nigeria,2009-02-09,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 61 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. February 09, 2009 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today. February 9, 2009 and reviewed the current domestic and international economic and financial developments. The Committee, at the outset, noted that the country's present economic and financial situation and its near-term prospects are impacted largely by exogenous factors. The deepening recession in industrialized economies and the slowdown in economic activity of emerging countries, the fall in capital flows into Nigeria through remittances and foreign investments and the drying up of credit lines for Nigerian banks would, in the view of the Committee, impact negatively on Nigeria's external and fiscal positions. The latest estimates of economic outlook of industrialized and emerging economies show that their performance in 2009 would continue to be a major drag on the world economy. The sub-Saharan Africa too is projected to post a lower rate of output growth in the year ahead. On the domestic scene, the Committee noted that macroeconomic outcomes in 2008 weakened slightly relative to the previous year due largely to the global financial crisis and the attendant economic slowdown. Indeed the Committee observed that output growth in 2008 was more or less unchanged from the 2007 level. High food prices throughout the year continued to drive head line inflation. Interest rates trended upwards from the third quarter and remained elevated through November, but moderated in December. The Naira exchange rate was stable through November, but depreciated sharply in December and January 2009 following increased demand pressures. The international developments, in the view of the Committee, present serious challenges to policy making in the short term notwithstanding signs of inherent resilience of the domestic real and financial sectors of the Nigerian economy. Monetary policy in particular has a major role to play in moderating the price variables—interest rates and exchange rates—in a manner that would foster business confidence and economic growth, price and exchange rate stability and financial soundness. Key Macro-economic Developments Inflation The Committee noted that the year-on-year headline inflation rate at end December 2008 was 151 per cent compared with 66 per cent at end- December 2007. Similarly the core inflation trended upwards to 104 per cent in December 2008 from 36 per cent at the end of 2007. The Bank's six month forecast horizon suggests gradual moderation of the year-on-year headline inflation, although may likely remain in the double-digit zone in the first half of the year. Similarly core inflation is projected to moderate during the period. Output The latest estimates of the aggregate output as measured by the Gross Domestic Product at 1990 constant basic prices, provided by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that aggregate output growth for 2008 was estimated at 641 per cent, close to the 645 per cent achieved in 2007. Agriculture contributed 275 percentage points to overall growth. Monetary Aggregates Provisional data for broad money (M2) grew sharply by 5802 per cent in 2008. The MPC noted that the growth in M2 was driven largely by the rise in credit to the private sector, which grew by 5952 per cent. Staff estimates indicate that monetary expansion in 2009 is likely to moderate on account of the expected decline in net foreign assets, complemented by the anticipated deceleration in growth in credit to the domestic economy. Exchange Rate The Committee noted the sharp depreciation in the naira exchange rate that took place in all the segments of the foreign exchange market in December 2008 following the sudden surge in demand, induced largely by the perceived negative impact of the global financial crisis. The reduced inflow to the economy has constrained supply to the market leaving the CBN as the main source of foreign exchange. However with the measures taken in January 2009, the exchange rate depreciation has moderated. External Reserves The MPC noted the recent foreign exchange demand pressure and decline in foreign exchange earnings which resulted from the fall in the international oil price and assured that efforts were being made to forestall the rapid depreciation of the naira and preserve the country's external reserves position in spite of the enormous challenges posed by the current turmoil in the global economy. Capital Market The MPC noted with cautious optimism the improvement in the activities at the equities segment of the Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) since January 30, 2009 against the backdrop of the bearish performance that characterized the market from the second quarter of 2008. With appropriate policy interventions, it is expected that the current positive development would be sustained. Outlook In line with seasonal pattern, growth in broad money is expected to moderate in the first quarter of 2009, owing to the lull in fiscal operations and economic activity during the period. Consequently staff projections indicate that headline inflation would moderate during the first and second quarters of 2009. Conclusions and Decisions The paradox that we face currently is that excess liquidity is co-existing with rising interest rates, which in real terms and in relation to the deposit rate seem to be high. On the one hand we need to tighten liquidity to address inflation and exchange rate concerns; while on the other hand, we would need to address high interest rate by relaxing monetary conditions. Another paradox is that the observed excess liquidity has not translated to commensurate credit creation; in fact credit growth appears to have slowed down. The Committee also noted the currently heightened risk perception and changes in liquidity management, accompanied by uncertainties in the fiscal 4 arena given that the budget for 2009 has not been passed. The outlook for the foreign exchange market is however positive. In the circumstance the MPC is concerned about achieving the multiple objectives of a sound financial system, price and exchange rate stability, as well as ensuring that credit continues to flow to the rest of the economy. Consequently the MPC decided as follows: a. Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) will be kept unchanged at 975 per cent; b. Open market operations will be actively used for achieving effective liquidity management; c. The CBN is seriously concerned about the rising lending rates and especially the re-pricing of existing facilities by banks as well as the wide spread between deposit and lending rates. The CBN will be meeting with the bank chief executive officers to agree on modalities to check excesses, especially in the light of the global economic and financial crisis. To anchor expectations and stabilize the exchange rate. MPC remains committed to managing the exchange rate within a band of +/-3 per cent until further notice. The difference between the CBN buying and selling rates shall not be more than 1 per cent; while that of banks and BDCs will not be more than 1 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively around the CBN rate.

Chile,2009-02-12,"P RESS RELEASE Santiago, 12 February 2009 Monetary Policy Meeting  February 2009* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to reduce the monetary policy interest rate by 250 basis points, to 4.75% (annual). This decision is grounded on the prospects of a significant fall in inflation, and accelerates the convergence of the monetary policy rate to a level consistent with the current macroeconomic environment and its related risks. Internationally, first quarter data shows that the severe global economic slowdown has deepened beyond expectations. Meanwhile, uncertainty persists with respect to when the global financial problems will be resolved. The likelihood of more negative scenarios has increased. Commodity prices have remained low. Domestically, available information for output and demand for the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first of 2009 show a larger widening of the output gap than expected in the latest Monetary Policy Report's. Employment has slowed and tight lending conditions persist. In January, monthly inflation was less than expected. Said surprise is explained primarily by methodological changes to the revised CPI's treatment of seasonal adjustments. In any case, a rapid convergence of inflation to the target is expected. Wage dynamics continue to be in line with historical patterns and inflation expectations have fallen. The Board considers that, in the most likely scenario, the monetary policy rate will follow a path that will run below the one assumed in the Monetary Policy Report's baseline scenario, shortly converging to levels comparable to those implicit in current financial asset prices for mid-year. The Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that projected inflation will stand at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2009-02-12,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release February 12, 2009 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to cut its overnight deposit rate by 100 bps to 105 percent per annu. The discount rate was also cut by 100 bps to 105 percent per annu. In its meeting held on February 12, 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates by 100 bps to 105 percent and 125 percent, respectivel. Annual headline CPI inflation dropped to 143 percent in January 2009 compared to 203 percent and 183 percent in November and December 2008, respectivel. The downward trend in headline inflation comes on the back of the considerable decline in domestic food inflatio. However it is important to emphasize that the sharp retrenchment in international commodity prices, which had begun since August 2008, has not been fully reflected in domestic price levels due to the downward price rigidities in domestic market. The risks to the domestic inflation outlook are lower in light of the deteriorating prospects for global growth in 2009 and given the sharply declining international commodity price. Against this background, the MPC judged that a less restrictive monetary policy stance is required, at this juncture, in order to stabilize economic growth around its potentia. The MPC will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global economic turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objectiv.

South Korea,2009-02-12,"In a related action, the Committee also lowered the interest rate on Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans by 25 basis points from 1., 50% to 1., 25%., (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement., ) The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 50 basis points from 2., 50% to 2., 00%. The pace of the domestic economic slowdown has accelerated. Domestic consumption and investment have slackened off further and exports have decreased rapidly. There is considered to be a greatly deepened downside risk to economic growth, which has been heightened by the worsening worldwide slump and the likelihood of the credit crunch persisting. Consumer price inflation has been decelerating continually due to downwardly stable international oil prices coupled with the impact of the economic downturn and the trend seems set to last for some time. In the real estate market, prices and transaction volumes have continued to decline. Financial market price variables such as the exchange rate and stock prices have shown a generally stable pattern of movements. Firms nevertheless still face considerable difficulties in fund-raising since financial institutions, wary of credit risk, are very conservative in the operation of their funds. Looking ahead, the Committee will do what is needed to improve liquidity conditions and to ward off the risk of a severe slowdown in economic activity."
Peru,2009-02-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2009 BCRP REDUCED THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE TO 6.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to reduce the monetary policy reference interest rate from 6.50 to 6.25 percent. This decision is based on the fact that lower inflationary pressures have been observed in a context of lower global economic growth and a drop in the international prices of food and fuels. The Board continues to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, particularly in terms of the development of domestic demand and of the national and international economic and financial situation. Inflation in January showed a rate of 0.11 percent, the lowest monthly rate observed since November 2007. As a result of this, last 12-month inflation has declined for the third consecutive month, posting 6.53 percent. Given that inflation and inflation expectations are expected to continue declining in the next months, inflation should converge to the target range in 2009. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 7.0 percent. Overnight deposits: 5.50 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 7.0 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the next month on its session to be held on March 5, 2009."
Philippines,2009-02-15,"BSP Governor Amando M Tetangco. Jr. announced that the Monetary Board, at its meeting last week, approved changes that would further liberalize banks' access to the BSP's rediscounting facility, effective 2 March 2009. These changes would provide more liquidity and credit in the banking system to ensure the orderly functioning of financial markets should global financial conditions worsen. The liberalized rediscounting guidelines would enable banks to rediscount more loan papers and therefore have access to additional funds that they can relend to the public. In November last year, the Monetary Board doubled the BSP rediscounting budget to P40 billion for the purpose of preemptively providing ample liquidity to the system against any possible credit tightness that may develop from the ongoing global financial turmoil. Under the revised guidelines, the Monetary Board increased further the peso rediscounting budget to P60 billion. The Monetary Board also increased the loan value of all eligible rediscounting papers from 80 percent to 90 percent of the outstanding balance of a borrowing bank's credit instrument, but not to exceed 70 percent of the appraised value of the underlying collateral. In addition, the rates for the peso rediscounts were also aligned with the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) rate, less 50 basis points. Governor Tetangco noted that the RRP rate is the BSP's main policy lever and, for more effective monetary policy, all BSP monetary policy instruments should be priced off this policy rate. The Monetary Board also raised the ceiling of the NPL ratio requirement to ten percentage points above the latest available industry average from the current ceiling of two percentage points above the industry average. This NPL ratio requirement, which is nonetheless still more stringent than the requirement imposed by other government banks, is meant to improve the access to the rediscounting window. Other revisions to the rediscounting guidelines include the lifting of the requirement to execute a Surety Agreement (SA) by any single stockholder, natural or juridical, owning more than 50 percent of the voting stocks of a bank with approved rediscounting lines with the BSP; and the imposition of a ceiling on the outstanding papers that a bank may rediscount equal to the rediscounting bank's single borrower's limit (25 percent of its net worth) or P3 billion, whichever is lower. The former is intended to facilitate faster processing of rediscounting loans, while the latter is aimed at providing greater access to as broad a number of banks as possible to the rediscounting facility to help address their liquidity requirements. Governor Tetangco said that the BSP remains committed to maintaining both price and financial stability, and noted that the easing inflation outlook provides greater room for monetary policy to support the liquidity and credit requirements of the economy."
Georgia,2009-02-18,"18.02.09: The National Bank of Georgia Lowers its Policy Rate to 7 Percent The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on February 18, 2009 and made the decision to lower its main policy rate (the refinancing rate) by 100 basis points to 7 percent. The annual rate of inflation in January decreased to 4.4 percent. As a result average annual inflation stands at 9.4 percent. According to existing forecasts, the downward pressure to inflation has increased since the Committee's last meeting. Increase in prices on short-term consumer goods is lower than average inflation; this has weakened inflationary expectations for households. The outlook for growth of money aggregates is still negative, which is also affected by low credit activity. The National Bank of Georgia is planning to initiate new monetary policy instruments to supply additional liquidity to the system. Forecasts on world economic growth remain pessimistic. According to updated global economic forecasts of the International Monetary Fund, annual economic growth in 2009 is projected to be 0.5%, which is 1.7 percentage points lower than the forecast made couple month ago. Economic growth outlook has deteriorated substantially in Georgia's neighboring and main trade partner countries. According to current NBG projections, the growth rate for the Georgian economy is also expected to decline to 2% in 2009. The NBG will closely monitor current developments in the economy and the financial markets and will, in due course, act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on March 18, 2009."
Turkiye,2009-02-19,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 13 percent to 11.50 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 15.50 percent to 14 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. is decreased from 9 percent to 7.5 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 18.50 percent to 17 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 14.50 percent to 13 percent. Recent readings indicate that the domestic economic activity continues to slow down. Problems in international credit markets and the global economy persist, suggesting that it will take some time for the economic activity to recover. Therefore, downward pressures on inflation are expected to prevail. Moreover, ongoing declines in oil and other commodity prices are having a favorable impact on disinflation. Looking ahead, the Committee predicts that the fall in inflation will be more significant in the forthcoming period and will reach the target levels sooner than envisaged. Judging that inflation is likely to significantly undershoot the target at the end of the year, the Committee has decided to lower short-term interest rates by 150 basis points. The Committee has indicated that the tightness in financial conditions still persist to some degree despite the recent policy rate cuts. The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective. Uncertainties regarding the impact of the problems in financial markets on the real economy remain high. The extent and the timing of a possible future rate cut will depend on the factors affecting the inflation outlook. Moreover, the Committee has underscored the importance of maintaining the smooth functioning of the financial system and the efficient operation of credit markets, and has reached a consensus on implementing additional measures regarding the foreign exchange liquidity. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Hungary,2009-02-23,"1 At its meeting on 23 February 2009, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at 9.50%. At its meeting, the Council also discussed the February 2009 issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation. Over recent months, global economic conditions and the prospects for growth both have deteriorated more sharply than previously expected. In 2008 Q4, output in the world's major economies fell and growth in emerging economies slowed significantly. Governments of the world's major economies announced substantial fiscal actions; however, so far these have had little practical effect. The sharper-than-expected decline in external demand has led to a significant deterioration in Hungary's growth prospects. The country's exports are comprised mainly of capital goods and production equipment; and demand for these has fallen sharply recently, due to the recession in Europe. Based on available information, conditions in Hungary's export markets are likely to deteriorate significantly in 2009, and consequently, a recovery in exports is unlikely before 2010 at the earliest. The decline in bank lending activity may continue. On the demand side, there has been a fall in debtors' willingness to borrow in response to the continued deterioration in the outlook for business activity. On the supply side, banks' lower appetite to take risk has led to a decline in lending activity. In addition, the domestic financial sector has been forced to reduce its dependence on foreign funding, which may also lead to a curtailment of lending. The tightening of credit standards has been another factor contributing to a decline in lending. That, in turn, may result in reduced household consumption as well as in lower corporate investment and production. The measures recently announced by the government are also likely to lead to a weakening in domestic demand. The government's policy package, aimed at restoring fiscal balance, may contribute to an increase in the economy's potential rate of growth; however, it is only likely to have an effect from 2011. Declining demand suggests that inflation is likely to remain low. As an effect of the government measures, inflation may rise above the medium-term target temporarily; however, the annual rate of inflation is expected to fall significantly below 3 per cent in the second half of 2010. In the recession, the rise in inflation is most likely to have little lasting effect and it is unlikely to put the Bank's inflation target at risk in the medium term. The Hungarian economy must adapt to the recent changes in the financial and economic environment. Monetary policy attempts to mitigate the costs of adjustment using the instruments at its disposal. However, there has recently been a shift in willingness to take risks and in investors' perception of risk associated with the Central and East European region, narrowing the room for monetary policy manoeuvre. The Monetary Council took its decision to maintain interest rates after consideration of the projections for the economy and inflation as well as the need to preserve the stability of the financial intermediary system. The Council will continue to take particular attention to preserving the stability of the financial intermediary system and to ensuring that capital flows remain undisturbed."
Israel,2009-02-23,"23.2.2009</td> The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for March 2009 by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for March 2009 will be 0.75 percent. In addition. The Bank is narrowing the interest rate corridor in the credit window and the commercial banks' deposit window from C 2B 10.5 percent to C 2B 10.25 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined by 0.5 percent in January, close to the average of the forecasters predictions. In the last twelve months the CPI rose by 3.3 percent, and in the last three months it fell by 1.2 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Forecasters' inflation expectations regarding the CPI in February and March are for a drop of one-tenth of a percent in each. Their forecasts for twelve months forward on average are for of a rise of 0.7 percent, while twelve-month expectations calculated from the capital market are for an increase of 0.8 percent. Forecasters expect that that the interest rate will reach an unprecedentedly low level in March, with an average prediction of 0.5 percent. Expectations derivedfrom the capital market are for reductions in the next two months that will bring the interest rate close to zero. The forecasters expect the interest rate to start rising again, and on average predict a level of 0.9 percentone year hence, while according to expectations from the capital market itwill reach a level of 1.3 percent one year from now. Real economic activity: National Accounts data for the last quarter of 2008 show negative growth at an annual rate of 0.5 percent. Exports in the last quarter of 2008 declined by 13 percent, that is to say, at an annual rate of 43.6 percent. Monthly data published last month add weight to the indications of the slowdown that started a few months ago. Further to its falls in the last few months, the January composite state-of-the-economyindex recorded its steepest drop so far, 1.2 percent, with declines in theindices of goods exports, capital goods imports, raw material imports, andtrade and services revenue. The labor market and wages: The downward trend in health tax revenues continued in January, with a real decline of 2.5 percent compared withJanuary 2008, indicating a drop in total wage payments, and hence a slowdown in the labor market. Employment Service data for January show a rise of 3.8 percent in the number of work seekers compared with the number in December, continuing the rise in the second half of 2008. At the same time, various indicators show a decline in the demand for labor. In November-January the real wage fell by 1.3 percent compared with the equivalent period a year earlier, while the nominal wage rose by 3.1 percent. Budget data: The downward trend in tax revenues persisted in January, and they were 19 percent lower, in real terms, than in January 2008, and NIS 1.5 billion lower than the level for the month (0.2 percent of annual GDP) consistent with the forecast seasonal path of tax revenues in 2009. That said, the limitation restricting expenditure to one-twelfth of the previous year's budget until the 2009 budget is approved resulted in a surplusof NIS 1.5 billion on government activity in January. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the monetary policy discussions of 25 January and 22 February, the shekel weakened against the dollar by 4.7 percent, and against the euro by 2.6 percent. In terms of the index of the effective exchange rate (weighted by the volume of trade) the shekel weakened by 2.5 percent. In that period the dollar strengthened against most of the major currencies, albeit more moderately than against the shekel. The capital and money markets: Between the interest rate discussions of 25 January and 22 February, the Tel Aviv 25 and the Tel Aviv 100 share price indices rose by 8.5 percent and 10 percent respectively, mainly due to the steep rise in the shares of oil and gas exploration companies. In this period stock markets around the world showed mixed trends. Following the announcement by the Bank of Israel that it would start buying governmentbonds on the secondary market, yields on 10-year unindexed Israel government bonds fell by 0.62 percentage points to 4.41 percent. Since the last monetary discussions, yields on US government 10-year bonds rose by 0.13 percentage points to 2.79 percent, so that the yield gap between the Israeli bonds and US government bonds contracted to 1.62 percentage points. Prices of Israeli corporate bonds continued to rise, among other things, as a result of the planned Ministry of Finance leverage (investment) funds. The Tel-Bond 20 index rose by 2.6 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 5.7 percent.Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, rose by 0.55 percentage points to 2.4 percent, and the CDS spreads of advanced economies and emerging market countries also widened. The world economy: The crisis in the global financial system continued, and became even more severe. The expansionary measures taken by governments and central banks around the world led to some improvement in the money and credit markets, but this effect was not uniform, and it was confined to the areas in which the authorities intervened. Uncertainty in the financial markets remains at a high level. Economic activity: The slowdown in global growth has intensified, against the background of the sharp fall in demand. Most of the advanced economies are already in recession, which is expected to deteriorate further, to be followed by a slower recovery processthan previously anticipated. The list of countries that have announce rescue plans and a switch to expansionary fiscal policy, with significant increases in budget deficits, is growing. Inflation: Inflation and inflation expectations are falling in light of the persistent slowdown in global demand and the drop in commodity, particularly oil, prices. Last month oil prices fell by 16 percent. The IMF predicts a marked decline in inflation in 2009.Against this background, many central banks are continuing to pursue expansionary monetary policies. However, due to the fact that in some countries the interest rate is close to zero, central banks are actively engaged in examining alternative policy measures. The main considerations behind the decision The reduction of the interest rate for March by 0.25 percentage points and the narrowing of the interest rate corridor will help strengthen the economy's ability to cope with the effects of the global economic crisis. The decision serves to encourage real economic activity, is consistent with the stability of the financial system, and serves to moderate the downward pressure on prices that threaten to pull inflation below the target range of price stability. The main considerations behind the decision are: The effects of the global crisis on real economic activity in Israel are evident in their negative impact on demand for exports and production, and the marked slowdown in economic activity. Central Bureau of Statistics and other data published last month indicate that nearly all sectors of the economy reflectthe negative change in economic activity in the second half of 2008. Thesedata are in accord with forecasts of growth close to zero in 2009. In the last three months the rate of inflation has fallen considerably, and it is expected to continue falling. Most of the components of the CPI show price declines. Forecasts of inflation in the next twelve months, both those of forecasters and those derived from the capital market, are below 1 percent, thelower limit of the price stability target range. Many central banks have cut their interest rates to unprecedentedly low levels, and the capital markets reflect expectations that expansionary monetary policies will continue. At the same time, as part of their expansionary monetary policies, central banks are using additional monetary instruments. With the interest rate now at an unprecedentedly low level, the Bank of Israel will focus on the use of additional instruments that lead to monetary expansion. Concurrently the Bank has narrowed the interest rate corridor in the credit window and the commercial bank deposit window from C 2B 10.5 percent to C 2B 10.25 percent. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments closely, and will employ whatever additional instruments are necessary to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragementof employment and growth and support for the stability of the financial system. 23.2.2009</td> The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for March 2009 by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent.

Malaysia,2009-02-24,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 50 basis points to 2.00 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 2.25 percent and 1.75 percent respectively. The Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) is also adjusted downwards from 2 percent to 1 percent effective 1 March 2009 to reduce further the cost of intermediation. The international economic and financial environment has deteriorated sharply in the recent quarter. The major advanced economies are experiencing a deepening economic contraction, while the regional economies are experiencing a rapid slowdown. The impact of the rapid decline in global demand on trade, production and investment activities in the Asian region has intensified. The turmoil in the international financial markets has also been protracted. While a number of economies have put in place stimulus measures to manage the downturn, their impact on the economy has yet to take effect. The downside risks to the global economic outlook have increased significantly. The Malaysian economy has been adversely impacted by these global developments. Exports and industrial production have declined steeply, while private investment activities have slowed down in recent months as businesses scaled back their spending. Consumer sentiment has also been affected by the weakening conditions in the labour market. The domestic economic conditions are expected to continue to remain challenging in the coming quarters with the continued deterioration in the global economy. While this has raised the risk of an economic contraction in 2009, the prospects remain intact for an economic recovery once global conditions stabilise given that the economy is not overleveraged, the financial system remains sound, and the external position is healthy. With inflation on a moderating trend, the task of macroeconomic policy is to support domestic demand until conditions in the global economy show signs of normalisation. Further measures will be introduced by the Bank to ensure continuous access to credit as well as to minimise the impact of the economic downturn on specific affected groups.

Poland,2009-02-25,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 25 February 2009 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 24 - 25 February 2009 The Council decided to lower NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points: (cid:131) reference rate to 4.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate to 5.50 % on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate to 2.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate to 4.25% on an annual basis. Data that have been released recently confirm that economic growth in Poland has been slowing considerably. Strong economic slowdown, which is mainly driven by recession in Poland's major trading partners, has been spilling over to further sectors of the economy. Similarly to other countries, limited credit availability stemming from increased risk aversion and considerable tightening of banks' lending conditions as well as deteriorating sentiment of economic agents contribute to slowing economic growth. Despite persisting excess liquidity of the banking sector, the cost of credit remains at a relatively high level which results from high risk premium incorporated in market interest rates and from increased margins. At the same time, information on labour market developments points to increasing unemployment and decelerating wage growth in the economy which is conducive to curbing inflationary pressure. The recent period saw a strong depreciation of Central and Eastern European currencies, including the zloty, which was accompanied by a considerable rise in the exchange rate volatility. In the Council's view, the zloty is currently weaker than the equilibrium exchange rate and does not reflect the relatively favourable condition and outlook for the Polish economy. According to GUS preliminary data, in January 2009 the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland decreased further (to 3.1%). Decline in inflation was mainly driven by falling fuel prices, yet the decrease in inflation was mitigated by a strong rise in administered prices (prices of energy carriers and services related to housing) and the depreciation of the zloty. The Council got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP based on the NECMOD model, prepared by the Economic Institute of the NBP, which is one of the inputs into the Council's decision-making on the NBP interest rates. The macroeconomic projection which will be presented in the Inflation Report has been prepared based on data released until 23 January 2009. The annual growth of consumer prices forecasted in the February projection is lower than expected in the October projection throughout the projection horizon. Under constant interest rates, there is a 50-percent probability that inflation will lie within the range of 2.53.9% in 2009 (compared to 3.9 5.7% in the October projection), 0.53.2% in 2010 (compared to 1.94.5%) and 0.92.6% in 2011. According to the February projection, the annual GDP growth will remain, with a 50-percent probability, within the range of 0.31.9% in 2009 (compared to 1.93.7% in the October projection), 1.23.3% in 2010 (compared to 2.74.5%) and 2.54.8% in 2011. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. In the Council's assessment, inflation may temporarily increase slightly in the coming months as a result of rising administered prices, primarily electricity and fuel prices. In the medium term, the recession in the global economy bringing about the decline in the domestic economic growth will contribute to lowering the inflationary pressure in Poland. Banks' tightening of their lending terms and conditions will also be conducive to curbing demand and, consequently, inflationary pressure. On the other hand, the considerable depreciation of the zloty exchange rate, observed in the past few months, will drive price increases. Weakening of the zloty exchange rate increases also the zloty value of liabilities of economic agents (both households and enterprises) denominated in foreign currency, which might lead to lowering domestic demand. The Council assessed the probability of inflation running below the target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running above the target and decided to lower the NBP interest rates. The easing of monetary policy should support the economy returning to the potential growth path, which in the medium term supports the achievement of the inflation target. The Council's decisions in the coming months will take account of the incoming information on the outlook for economic growth, inflation and situation in the financial markets in Poland and abroad and information on zloty exchange rate developments. The Monetary Policy Council pursues the direct inflation targeting under a floating exchange rate. In line with this strategy, the National Bank of Poland may use instruments directly affecting the zloty exchange rate. Maintaining fiscal discipline in the public finance sector may be conducive to easing the monetary policy. The Council will analyse the impact of developments in the domestic interbank market on the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Poland. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts necessary for the euro adoption in Poland. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  February 2009."
Thailand,2009-02-25,"No 6 /2009 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 25 February 2009 Ms. Duangmanee Vongpradhip. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. The on-going global financial crisis resulted in a marked slowdown in world economic growth with high uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. The sharp decline in external demand adversely affected regional countries including Thailand through a marked contraction in exports. In addition, domestic demand remained weak, while the impact of authorities' measures to stimulate the economy would take some time to come into full effect. The MPC assessed that, going forward, risks to growth increased while inflation was expected to decline further. Core inflation could be below the target range during certain periods of this year. The MPC therefore viewed that monetary policy could be eased further to support economic recovery and to safeguard price stability going forward. The MPC therefore decided to lower the policy interest rate by 050 per cent per annum, from 200 per cent per annum to 150 per cent per annum, effective immediately."
Philippines,2009-03-04,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to reduce the BSP's key policy interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also reduced accordingly. These adjustments will be effective immediately. This is the third consecutive reduction in policy rates since December 2008, bringing the cumulative reduction in the BSP's key policy rates to 125 basis points. In its assessment of macroeconomic conditions, the Monetary Board noted that the latest baseline inflation forecasts continue to indicate within-target inflation in 2009 and 2010 based on the latest data on, among others, oil prices, demand indicators, and inflation readings. In addition, inflation expectations remain well anchored. The Monetary Board believes that the global financial strains are likely to persist and pose risks to economic activity. An accommodative monetary policy stance is expected to help ensure greater availability of credit and reinforce market confidence. However, given possible upside risks to inflation, notably the volatility in oil prices and in exchange rates, increases in utility rates, and potential price pressures coming from some agricultural commodities, the Monetary Board decided that a more measured adjustment of policy rates was needed. The preemptive monetary stimulus undertaken thus far, together with the observed ample liquidity and decline in market interest rates, should provide support to economic activity in the months ahead, particularly as crucial fiscal stimulus initiatives are brought on stream. The BSP, while keeping its price stability objective paramount, is prepared to employ its other monetary policy instruments to supply the needed liquidity to the economy and support domestic spending."
Euroarea,2009-03-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided today to reduce the key ECB interest rates by a further 50 basis points. This decision brings the total reduction in the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem since 8 October 2008 to 275 basis points. Overall, inflation rates have decreased significantly and are now expected to remain well below 2% over 2009 and 2010. This outlook for inflation is due to the fall in commodity prices and diminishing domestic price and cost pressures, reflecting the severe downturn in economic activity. Indeed, recent economic data releases and survey information add further evidence to our assessment that both global and euro area demand are likely to be very weak in 2009. Over the course of 2010, the economy is expected to gradually recover. At the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation at rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing. After today's decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. The Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations, which supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil, the world economy has weakened substantially in recent months, affecting increasingly also emerging market economies. In a climate of heightened uncertainty, a severe fall in world trade volumes has been accompanied by a pronounced decline in domestic demand in the euro area. As a consequence, euro area real GDP contracted markedly in the fourth quarter of 2008, by 1.5% on a quarterly basis, according to Eurostat's first estimate. Available data and survey indicators suggest that economic activity in the euro area remained weak in early 2009. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects that both global and domestic demand will decline in 2009 but thereafter recover gradually. This assessment is also reflected in the March 2009 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which place annual real GDP growth in a range of -3.2% to -2.2% in 2009, and between -0.7% and +0.7% in 2010. These ranges represent a downward revision of the December 2008 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. In both 2009 and 2010, the annual GDP growth rate will be significantly reduced by negative carry-over effects from the previous year. The projected gradual recovery in 2010 reflects the effects of the substantial macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as of the extensive policy measures that have been introduced to restore the functioning of the financial system, both inside and outside the euro area. In addition, the fall in commodity prices is expected to support real disposable income and consumption in the period ahead. The outlook for the economy continues to be surrounded by uncertainty. In the view of the Governing Council, the risks to the economic outlook now appear to be more balanced. On the one hand, there may be stronger than anticipated positive effects, also on confidence, stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus under way and reflecting other policy measures taken. On the other hand, concerns relate mainly to the potential for a stronger impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets, as well as to the emergence and intensification of protectionist pressures and to possible adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has been steadily declining since the middle of 2008, when it reached a peak of 4.0%. In February 2009 it was 1.2%, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, broadly unchanged from 1.1% in January. The decline in inflation since last summer primarily reflects the sharp falls in global commodity prices over this period. However, signs of a more broad-based reduction in inflationary risks are also increasingly emerging. Reflecting these trends, the March 2009 ECB staff inflation projections constitute a significant downward revision compared with the previous projections and foresee annual HICP inflation at between 0.1% and 0.7% in 2009. Owing mainly to base effects stemming from the past behaviour of energy prices, headline annual inflation rates are projected to decline further in the coming months, possibly temporarily reaching negative levels around mid-year. Thereafter, annual inflation is expected to increase again, also owing to base effects stemming from past energy price developments. Accordingly, it is likely that HICP inflation rates will fluctuate noticeably during 2009. Such short-term volatility is, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. For 2010. ECB staff project HICP inflation at between 0.6% and 1.4%. This range also represents a substantial downward revision compared with the December 2008 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, mainly reflecting the change in the economic growth outlook. Available forecasts from international organisations have also been revised downwards and broadly confirm an outlook of moderate inflation rates in 2010. As in the case of growth, a considerable degree of uncertainty surrounds the inflation projections. They relate in particular to the risks to the outlook for economic activity as well as to risks to commodity prices. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data and estimates provide further evidence of an ongoing deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion in the euro area. This implies a further reduction in inflationary risks in the medium term. The further deceleration in underlying monetary dynamics has contrasted with the high month-to-month volatility of developments in M3 and its components which has been observed since the financial turmoil intensified in September 2008. This relates in particular to marketable instruments, but also to the significant substitution that is taking place between different categories of deposits included in M3. While annual M3 growth declined further, to 5.9%, in January 2009, the annual growth rate of the narrow aggregate M1, which includes the most liquid assets, rose to 5.2%. Volatility also characterised the flow of MFI loans to the private sector around the turn of the year, with a monthly contraction in the outstanding amount in December followed by a significantly positive flow in January. However, discounting a possible turn-of-the-year effect and looking beyond these latest developments confirms the decline in the growth of bank credit to households and non-financial corporations observed in 2008. At the same time, it appears that the substantial past reduction in the key ECB interest rates is increasingly being passed through to bank lending rates, indicating that, despite the tensions in financial markets, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is not significantly hampered in the euro area. Still, more data and analysis are needed to firmly assess the outlook for credit in the period ahead. To sum up, inflation rates have decreased significantly and are now expected to remain well below 2% over 2009 and 2010. Recent economic data releases and survey information add further evidence to our assessment that both global and euro area demand are likely to be very weak in 2009. Over the course of 2010, the economy is expected to gradually recover. At the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation at rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing. After today's decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. The Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations, which supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding the fiscal policy responses to the economic downturn, the euro area countries' updated stability programmes and recent addenda confirm the prospect of a sharp and broad-based deterioration in euro area public finances. A credible commitment to a path of consolidation in order to return to sound fiscal positions, respecting fully the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, is necessary to maintain the public's trust in the sustainability of public finances, which is important both for the economy to recover and for supporting long-term growth. In this respect, we support the Commission's intention to initiate excessive deficit procedures for several countries. This is crucial to preserve the credibility of the EU fiscal surveillance framework. It is important that clear deadlines are set for correction of the excessive deficits and that consolidation plans are based on firm and well-specified structural measures. As regards structural policies, it remains important to pursue economic policies in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition. In this respect, it is essential that government support measures do not distort competition and delay necessary structural adjustment, and it is of the utmost importance to avoid protectionist measures. Refraining from protectionism will be key to allowing the global economy to overcome the current crisis more rapidly. The successful completion of the Doha round of trade negotiations would also be a milestone towards a more integrated and open world economy for the benefit of all."
Chile,2009-03-12,"P RESS RELEASE Santiago, 12 March 2009 Monetary Policy Meeting  March 2009 * In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to reduce the monetary policy interest rate by 250 basis points, to 2.25% (annual). This decision is grounded on a projected fast decline in inflation, and brings the policy rate closer to a level consistent with the current macroeconomic environment and its related risks. Internationally, the latest data indicate that global growth prospects for this year have deteriorated further, while uncertainty persists with respect to when the global financial problems will be resolved. Although the copper price has increased, commodity prices remain low. Domestically, available information on output for the first-quarter 2009 show negative y-o-y variation, largely due to the drastic deceleration seen in the last part of 2008. Unemployment has increased. Tight lending conditions persist, but are beginning to reflect the impact of the increased monetary stimulus. In February, the set of inflation indicators revealed low inflationary pressures. Wage dynamics continue to be in line with historical patterns. Inflation expectations have fallen and a fast drop toward the target is foreseen. The Board considers that further cuts to the monetary policy rate may be necessary, although their size and frequency will be comparable to historical patterns. Therefore, the Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that projected inflation will stand at 3% over the policy horizon. The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2009-03-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. Domestic economic activity has kept on declining due to the continued decrease in both domestic demand and exports. The downside risk to economic growth is considered to have been greatly heightened by the deepening global economic slump and the international financial market unrest. Consumer price inflation has moved higher under the influence of the won's depreciation, but the weakening of demand-pull pressures owing to the economic downturn will be likely to continue to moderate the pace of the increase. In the real estate market, prices and transaction volumes have continued to decline. Financial market price variables such as the exchange rate and stock prices have shown unstable movements. Meanwhile, lending to the household sector and SMEs has increased in line with some moderation in financial institutions' attitude to lending. Looking ahead, the Committee will do what is needed to ward off a severe slowdown in economic activity and to give support to financial market stabilization."
Peru,2009-03-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2009 BCRP REDUCED THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE TO 6.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to reduce the monetary policy reference interest rate from 6.25 to 6.0 percent. With this decision, the Central Bank continues to loosen its monetary policy stance given that lower inflationary pressures and declining inflation expectations are being observed in a context of lower growth in the global economy. Should this trend persist, the Bank will continue to loosen its monetary policy stance. The Board continues to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, particularly in terms of the development of domestic demand and of the international economic and financial situation. Inflation in February showed a rate of -0.07 percent, as a result of which last 12-month inflation, which has declined for the fourth consecutive month, was 5.49 percent. Inflation and economic agents' expectations about inflation are expected to continue declining in the following months, thus allowing inflation's convergence to the target range in the fourth quarter of this year. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 6.75 percent. Overnight deposits: 5.25 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 6.75 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the next month on its session of April 8, 2009."
Georgia,2009-03-18,"18.03.2009: The NBG Lowers its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) by 50 Basis Points, to 6.5 Percent The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on March 18, 2009 and decided to lower its main policy rate (the refinancing rate), by 50 basis points, to 6.5 percent. The annual rate of inflation decreased to 2.1 percent in January. As a result, average annual inflation stands at 8.7 percent. Since the Committee's last meeting, existing forecasts point towards the increasing influence of factors which should lead to a reduction in inflation. An increase in prices has been particularly sluggish for short- term consumer goods, which reduces the public's inflation expectations. Core inflation has diminished significantly as well. The growth rate in monetary aggregates remains negative, which is likely an indicator of the slowdown in overall economic activity. The rate of lending to the economy remains conservative. According to forecasts, the volume of imports has decreased considerably, a factor which has reduced pressure on the exchange rate. Last week, the National Bank of Georgia introduced a new instrument, the foreign exchange auction which should add increased flexibility to the exchange rate. The NBG will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on April 15, 2009."
United States,2009-03-18,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the economy continues to contract. Job losses, declining equity and housing wealth, and tight credit conditions have weighed on consumer sentiment and spending. Weaker sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories and fixed investment. U.S. exports have slumped as a number of major trading partners have also fallen into recession. Although the near-term economic outlook is weak, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, together with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth. In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued. Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To provide greater support to mortgage lending and housing markets, the Committee decided today to increase the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet further by purchasing up to an additional $750 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities, bringing its total purchases of these securities to up to $1.25 trillion this year, and to increase its purchases of agency debt this year by up to $100 billion to a total of up to $200 billion. Moreover, to help improve conditions in private credit markets, the Committee decided to purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months. The Federal Reserve has launched the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses and anticipates that the range of eligible collateral for this facility is likely to be expanded to include other financial assets. The Committee will continue to carefully monitor the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial and economic developments. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Charles L Evans; Donald L Kohn; Jeffrey M Lacker; Dennis P Lockhart; Daniel K Tarullo; Kevin M Warsh; and Janet L Yellen."
Turkiye,2009-03-19,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 11.50 percent to 10.50 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 14 percent to 13 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. is decreased from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 17 percent to 16 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 13 percent to 12 percent. Recent data releases indicate that domestic economic activity continues to slow down. Problems in international credit markets persist while forecasts of global economic growth are consistently revised downwards, suggesting that the economic activity is not likely to recover anytime soon. Therefore, downward pressures on inflation are expected to continue. Moreover, ongoing declines in oil and other commodity prices are having a favorable impact on disinflation. The Committee has noted that inflation may display a temporary rise in March due to a sharp increase in unprocessed food prices, before resuming its downward trend. The Committee has indicated that the rate cuts have lowered the probability of significantly undershooting the end-year inflation target. However, the tightness in financial conditions still persists to some extent, and uncertainties regarding the impact of the problems in financial markets on the real economy remain high, suggesting that downside risks still remain. The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective. Looking forward, the Committee envisages that the next rate cut may be measured, and that it may be necessary for the monetary policy to maintain an easing bias for a considerable period. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Hungary,2009-03-23,"At its meeting on 23 March 2009, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at 9.50%. Over recent months, international investors' willingness to take risk has declined sharply and sentiment towards Central and Eastern Europe has deteriorated, leading to a significant depreciation of the forint. Any further weakening in the exchange rate would have a harmful effect on the capital position of the domestic financial intermediary system in the medium term. In addition, its expected stimulative effect on output may be questioned. In the Council's judgement, the risk of an even deeper economic downturn than previously expected has increased. Manufacturing and market services slowed significantly in the final quarter of 2008, due to declining external demand and the contraction of lending. Households are adjusting to the shifts in international financing conditions and the deterioration in the prospects for income growth by curtailing consumption expenditures, which, in turn, is acting to reduce Hungary's external financing requirement. Inflation has fallen to a level consistent with price stability in recent months. However, this reflected contrasting developments in the economy. Services price inflation has been falling sharply for several consecutive months, owing to the disciplinary effect on pricing of the economic downturn. However, the pass-through of weaker exchange rates into tradables prices is adding to upside risks to inflation. In the short term, exchange rate depreciation contributes to an improvement in the profitability of exporting firms and the competitiveness of domestic producers against imports; however, its effect on growth may be offset by the fact that economic agents are suffering sizeable losses on their positions taken in anticipation of an appreciation. The depreciation of the forint has led to a slowing in lending by banks, and it may worsen their capital position over the medium term through a deterioration in the loan portfolio. After consideration of the latest developments in the real economy and inflation as well as the need to preserve the stability of the financial intermediary system, the Monetary Council decided to leave interest rates unchanged. The Council will continue to focus on preventing a persistent deviation of financial market conditions from economic fundamentals. To this end, it is ready to use the full range of monetary policy instruments at its disposal."
Israel,2009-03-23,"23.3.2009</td> The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for April 2009 by 25 basis points to 0.5 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for April 2009 will be reduced by 25 basis points to 0.5 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined by 0.1 percent in February, and was slightly below forecasters' predictions of no change. In the last four months the CPI fell by 1.3 percent, and in the last twelve months it rose by 3.4 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The averages of forecasters' predictions regarding the CPI in March and April are for increases of 0.2 percent and 0.5 percent respectively. Their forecasts for twelve months forward on average are for an increase of 0.6 percent in the CPI, while twelve-month expectations calculated from the capital market are for an increase of 0.7 percent. Inflation expectations for two years forward and beyond derived from the capital market rose, and are currently around the middle ofthe inflation target range. Forecasters' expectations regarding the Bank of Israel's interest rate for April range from no change to a cut of 25 basis points. On average, they expect the interest rate to be 1 percent one year hence. Expectations derived from the capital market are on average for a reduction of 20 basis points in the interest rate for April, and interest of 1.8 percent in one year's time. Real economic activity: The data relating to the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 indicate a contraction of economic activity, with a concurrent significant drop in both export and domestic demand. In the firsttwo months of 2009 exports (monthly average) fell at by 8.3 percent compared with the average monthly level in the last quarter of 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2008 private consumption declined by 3.1 percent, annual rate. The composite state-of-the-economy index for February showed a reduction of 1.1 percent, and in the last six months the index has dropped sharply, by 4.5 percent. In light of the negative data relating to Israel's economy and the further downward revisions of forecasts of global growth and world trade by international organizations, the Bank of Israel reduced its growth forecast for 2009 from a negative 0.2 percent to a negative 1.5 percent. The labor market and wages: The Manpower Survey for the last quarter of 2008 shows an increase in the unemployment rate to 6.3 percent, witha steep decline in the number of full-time employees and an increase in the number of those in part-time employment. The number of new claims for unemployment benefits in February was 60 percent higher than in February 2008. The real wage fell by 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, and the nominal wage by 1.2 percent, annual rates. The downward trend in health tax revenues continued in February, with a decline of about 1 percent compared with February 2008. This decline is an indication of a reduction in total wage payments, and hence of a slowdown in the labor market. Budget data: The budget deficit (excluding credit) in January-February 2009 was NIS 1.5 billion, compared with NIS 3.6 billion in the first two months of 2008. Assuming that the government keeps its expenditure at the legally defined ceiling, the deficit in 2009 is expected to be 5.2 percent of GDP, i.e. NIS 37 billion. The downward trend in tax revenues persisted in February and, excluding the effects of changes in tax rates,they were 17 percent lower, in real terms, than in February 2008. This resulted from a decline in both direct and indirect tax revenues. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the monetary policy discussions of 22 February and 22 March, the shekel strengthened against the dollar by 3.3 percent, to NIS 4.02 to the dollar, and weakened against the euro by 5 percent. In terms of the index of the effective exchange rate vis-?-vis the currencies of Israel's trading partners (weighted by thevolume of trade), the shekel weakened by 0.5 percent. In that period the dollar weakened against most of the major currencies by more than it did against the shekel. The capital and money markets: Between the interest rate discussions of 22 February and 22 March, the Tel Aviv 25 and the Tel Aviv 100 shareprice indices fell by 1.9 percent and 2.8 percent respectively. In this period stock markets around the world generally recorded increases. Yields ongovernment bonds, which had fallen steeply following the announcement by the Bank of Israel that it would start implementing its plan to buy government bonds on the secondary market, rose during most of this period. Towards the end of the period they started falling, following the announcement by the Fed that it would buy US government bonds and the rapid decline in yields which it caused. Yields on 10-year unindexed Israel government bonds roseby 0.23 percentage points to 4.63 percent. Since the last monetary discussions, yields on US government 10-year bonds fell by 0.15 percentage points to 2.64 percent. On 19 March the Ministry of Finance successfully launched a bond issue in the United States of $1.5 billion with a yield gap of 2.7 percentage points compared with the yield on US government bonds. Prices of Israeli corporate bonds showed mixed trends. The Tel-Bond 20 index increased by 1.4 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index dipped by 0.5 percent. Israel'ssovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, increasedto 2.45 percent, whereas the CDS spreads of advanced economies and emerging market countries narrowed. The world economy: The crisis in the global financial system continued. Authorities continued with their intervention in the financial markets, with the intention of causing them, and in particular the credit markets, to resume functioning as normal. The Fed and the Bank of England announced purchases of significant quantities of government bonds. There were signs of some reduction in indices of risk aversion, and this led to rises in stock markets around the world. Economic activity: The data relating to last month showed further deterioration in the global recession. The IMFexpects global GDP to increase by 0.5 percent in 2009. Inflation: Global inflation in the next few months is expected to be negative. That said, the recent rises in oil prices are likely to lead to a rise in the inflation rate. The Fed, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan have set interest rates at around zero, and the rates of some other central banks are converging to that level. Together with those zero-level interest rates, central banks are using additional instruments to bring about monetary expansion. The main considerations behind the decision The reduction of the interest rate for April by 0.25 percentage points will help strengthen the economy's ability to cope with the effects of the global economic crisis. This reduction will serve to encourage real economic activity, is consistent with the stability of the financial system, and will serve to moderate the downward pressure on prices that is likelyto pull inflation below the target range of price stability. The main considerations behind the decision are: Data that became available during the last month point to an increase in the severity of the recession in global and domestic economic activity. Forecasts of theextent of global activity and world trade have been revised downwards. In light of these developments, the Bank of Israel revised its forecast of Israel's growth in 2009 to a negative 1.5 percent. The effects of the global crisis are evident, among other things, in declines in exports and in domestic demand. The downward trend in inflation in the last few months continued in February. Forecasters' twelve-month-forward inflation expectations and those calculated fromthe capital market are below the lower limit of the target range. The downward trend of commodity prices evident in the last few months has, however,ended. Central banks around the world are continuing with their expansionary monetary policies, and the capital markets expect monetary expansion to persist. Some central banks that had not yet reached zero levels of interest cut their rates further, and some of those that have reached zero levels are employing additional instruments aimed at easing credit for households and businesses. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments, and will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. 23.3.2009</td> The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for April 2009 by 25 basis points to 0.5 percent.

South Africa,2009-03-24,"The global economy has continued to weaken significantly in recent months as a result of the turmoil in the financial markets. There is growing uncertainty regarding the depth and duration of the economic slowdown. The South African economy has not escaped the impact of these developments, and domestic production has contracted as a result of weak domestic demand and a significant decline in export demand. Against this backdrop of widening domestic and global output gaps, the balance of risks to the inflation outlook has changed somewhat. Inflation as measured by the reweighted and reconstituted consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas (which is the new target measure) measured 8,1 per cent in January 2009. Food and non-alcoholic beverages prices, which increased at year-on-year rates of 15,7 per cent in January, contributed 2,4 percentage points to total inflation. The housing and utilities category contributed 2,1 percentage points, and together with food accounted for more than half of the measured inflation increase. The transport component had a minimal impact on the overall CPI as a result of the 20,3 per cent reduction in petrol prices during January. Producer price inflation, which reached 19,1 per cent in August 2008, continued its downward trend, measuring 9,2 per cent in January 2009. Despite the depreciation of the rand during 2008, producer prices of imported goods declined at a year-on-year rate of 5 per cent in January. The most recent central forecast of the Bank shows a near-term deterioration in the inflation outlook but a more favourable trend is forecast for the medium term, which is the relevant time frame for monetary policy. Consumer price inflation is expected to average 8,1 per cent in the first quarter of 2009 and then to decline to below 6 per cent in the third quarter of the year. As a result of technical base effects, inflation is then expected to marginally exceed the upper end of the inflation target range, before returning back to within the range in the second quarter of 2010 and to remain there until the end of the forecast period in the fourth quarter of 2010, when it is expected to average 5,3 per cent. The heightened levels of uncertainty and the rate of change of global developments make these forecasts subject to higher risk than is usually the case. Expectations by analysts are similar to those of the Bank, with the Reuters consensus forecast showing a moderate upward revision of inflation in 2009 and a relatively unchanged forecast in 2010, when inflation is expected to average 5,5 per cent in the final quarter. Most forecasters expect inflation to have increased moderately in February 2009 before resuming its downward trend. Inflation expectations, as reflected in the yield differential between inflation-linked bonds and conventional government bonds, have increased slightly since the previous meeting of the MPC but remain within the inflation target range. The inflation outlook has been dominated by the continued weakening of the global economy and financial markets, notwithstanding significant monetary and fiscal measures introduced by central banks and governments. The decline in global demand has resulted in a marked contraction in international trade. The International Monetary Fund, which in January was forecasting global growth to average 0,5 per cent in 2009, now expects the global economy to contract by up to one per cent in 2009. Numerous industrialised and developing countries are already experiencing negative growth. World inflation is being restrained by declining demand and lower commodity prices which are expected to remain subdued under these conditions of negative or low growth. The weak global demand has been reflected in the export performance of the South African economy. However, the decline in the value of exports in the final quarter of 2008 was more than offset by a lower value of imports, mainly due to declining international oil prices. Combined with a narrowing of the deficit on the services, income and current transfer account of the balance of payments, this resulted in a narrowing of the deficit on the current account from 7,8 per cent of GDP in the third quarter of 2008 to 5,8 per cent in the final quarter. However, the published January trade data, which showed a further considerable decline in the value of merchandise exports, suggest that the improvement in the trade deficit may not be sustained to the same extent seen in the fourth quarter. The deficit on the current account of the balance of payments measured 7,4 per cent of GDP for the 2008 calendar year. Domestic demand conditions have also deteriorated further. In the fourth quarter of 2008, gross domestic expenditure and domestic final demand contracted by 3,9 per cent and 0,4 per cent respectively. Final consumption expenditure by households declined by 2,7 per cent, mainly as a result of a 20 per cent contraction in consumption of durable goods. The growth in gross fixed capital formation moderated further, recording an annualised growth rate of 3 per cent. Motor vehicle sales, which have been under pressure for some time, declined at a year-on-year rate of 35,6 per cent in February. In January, real retail sales increased at a year-on-year rate of 1,7 per cent -the first year-on-year increase in 9 months- while wholesale trade sales declined by 4,5 per cent over the same period. Domestic demand conditions are expected to remain under pressure as a result of declining disposable incomes, tighter credit conditions and negative wealth effects. Credit extension to the private sector has continued its downward trend, a result of lower demand and more stringent lending criteria being applied by banks. In January 2009, growth in total loans and advances to the private sector measured 11,4 per cent. The slower rate of credit extension has resulted in a further moderation of the ratio of household debt to disposable income to 76,4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with a peak of 78,2 per cent in the first quarter of that year. Domestic output has been impacted appreciably by these external and domestic demand developments, resulting in a further widening of the domestic output gap. In the final quarter of 2008, gross domestic product contracted at an annualised rate of 1,8 per cent, mainly due to a 22 per cent decline in manufacturing sector output. The high frequency data indicate that these adverse conditions may have persisted in the first quarter of 2009. Manufacturing and mining output contracted at year-on-year rates of 11,1 cent and 8,7 per cent respectively in January, while the Investec/BER Purchasing Managers Index reached a new low in February, reflecting continued strain on the manufacturing sector. The latest Bureau for Economic Research manufacturing survey indicates extreme and broad-based weakness in this sector in the first quarter of 2009. The RMB/BER Business Confidence Index surveyed in the first quarter of 2009 reached its lowest level since 1999, particularly in the manufacturing, wholesale and construction sectors. The confidence of retailers of non-durable goods increased somewhat. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand has been relatively stable since the beginning the year and has appreciated by about 2,5 per cent since the previous meeting. Movements in the rand exchange rate in recent weeks have been mainly reflecting volatile international currency developments. After the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand first depreciated to around R10,60 against the US dollar, as the dollar strengthened against most currencies. Since then the US dollar has weakened somewhat, and the rand is currently trading at levels of around R9,45 per US dollar. The upside risks to the inflation outlook emanate primarily from cost-push pressures, particularly from administered prices. These include possible higher-than-expected electricity tariff increases. The decline in inflation may also be delayed by continued high rates of increases in food prices, despite marked declines in producer price food inflation. Against the background of a slowing global and domestic economy and an improved medium-term outlook for inflation, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 100 basis points to 9,5 per cent per annum with effect from 25 March 2009."
Poland,2009-03-25,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 25 March 2009 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 24-25 March 2009 The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points: (cid:131) reference rate to 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate to 5.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate to 2.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate to 4.00% on an annual basis. The decline in GDP growth in 2008 Q4 and fall in industrial output, exports and retail sales in the first months of 2009 confirm that economic growth in Poland has been slowing considerably. Strong economic slowdown which is mainly driven by recession in Poland's major trading partners has been spilling over to further sectors of the economy. Similarly to other countries, limited credit availability stemming from increased risk aversion and considerable tightening of banks' lending conditions as well as deteriorating sentiment of economic agents contribute to slowing economic growth. Despite persisting excess liquidity of the banking sector, the cost of credit remains at a relatively high level which results from high risk premium incorporated in market interest rates and from increased margins. At the same time, information on labour market developments points to declining employment, increasing unemployment and decelerating wage growth which is conducive to curbing inflationary pressure. The recent period was marked by still heightened exchange rate volatility of currencies of Central and Eastern European countries, as well as currencies of developed economies. This has also affected the zloty exchange rate. In line with expectations, the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland increased in February 2009 (to 3.3% as compared with the revised downwards 2.8% in January 2009), albeit remained below the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target set at 3.5%. The rise in inflation was mainly driven by rising fuel prices due to previously observed depreciation of zloty exchange rate. At the same time all core inflation indices increased. Considerable rise in the prices of energy and services related to flat maintenance observed in the first two months of 2009, was the main factor contributing to the annual price growth being maintained at an increased level. In the Council's assessment, inflation in the coming months is likely to temporarily remain at an elevated level, mainly as a result of the already observed rise in administered prices, primarily of energy. In the medium term, the recession in the global economy bringing about the decline in the domestic economic growth will lower the inflationary pressure in Poland. Deteriorating situation in the labour market and worsening financial condition of enterprises as well as banks' lending tightening will also be conducive to curbing demand and, consequently, inflationary pressure.

Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, the other hand, the previously observed considerable depreciation of the zloty exchange rate will drive price increases. Weakening of the zloty exchange rate has also increased the zloty value of liabilities of economic agents (both households and enterprises) denominated in foreign currency, which might lead to lowering domestic demand. The Council assessed the probability of inflation running below the target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running above the target and decided to lower the NBP interest rates. The easing of monetary policy supports the economy returning to the potential growth path, which in the medium term supports the achievement of the inflation target. The Council's decisions in the coming months will take account of the incoming information on the outlook for economic growth, inflation and situation in the financial markets in Poland and abroad and information on zloty exchange rate developments. Maintaining fiscal discipline in the public finance sector may be conducive to easing the monetary policy. The Council will analyse the impact of developments in the domestic interbank market on the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Poland. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts necessary for the euro adoption in Poland."
Egypt,2009-03-26,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release March 26, 2009 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to cut its overnight deposit rate by 50 bps to 10 percent per annu. The discount rate was also cut by 50 bps to 10 percent per annu. In its meeting held on March 26, 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates by 50 bps to 10 percent and 12 percent, respectivel. Annual headline CPI inflation continued to decline in February 2009, reaching 135 percent down from 143 percent in January, to record a cumulative drop of 101 percentage points over the past six month. The downward trend in headline inflation comes on the back of the decline in domestic food inflation, which fell from 255 percent (y/y) in September 2008 to 144 percent (y/y) in February 200. However it is important to emphasize that the sharp retrenchment in international commodity prices, which had begun in the second half of 2008, has not been fully reflected in domestic price levels due to the downward price rigidities in domestic market. In the meantime, domestic GDP growth in 2008/09 Q2 softened, declining to 41 percent compared to 58 percent in the previous quarter and 71 in 2007/08, chiefly a consequence of the continuing global economic slowdow. The slower growth rates witnessed in the manufacturing sector, in addition to the contraction in Suez Canal activity and exports, have led to the evident retreat in domestic economic growt. Going forward, the dire prospects for global growth in 2009 are likely to exert further downward pressures on external demand with unfavorable repercussions on the domestic growth outloo. While annual headline inflation is still elevated, the lower inflationary pressures driven by lower international food prices and slower domestic economic growth currently project that annual inflation will fall towards the CBE's comfort zone by mid-200. The MPC will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global economic turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objectiv.

Romania,2009-03-31,"In its meeting of March 31, 2009, the Board of the National Bank of Romania analyzed and approved the letter of intent sent to the International Monetary Fund regarding the external financing arrangement with international financial institutions and the European Union. The NBR Board has also decided the following:. The NBR Board will continue to monitor domestic and global economic developments so that through an adequate use of its available instruments to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives in what concerns attaining and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as ensuring financial stability. The analysis of the most recent statistics show an increase in the annual inflation rate and a slowdown of economic growth as a result of reduction in both exports and external financing against the background of deepening global economic and financial crisis. The annual inflation rate climbed to 6.89 percent in February 2009 from 6.3 percent last December due to increases in some administered prices, fuel and services against the backdrop of leu depreciation in the context of heightened risk aversion of investors with regard to Central and East European economies. The adjusted annual CORE2 inflation rate - calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) as well as the effect of vice tax - also rose to 6.6 percent last month from 6.3 percent in December 2008. In the monetary area it is worth noting a relative stagnation of intermediation in the context of a significant slowdown of credit to the private sector. The above-mentioned factors reveal the need to maintain a prudent monetary policy stance given the need to continue the adjustment of the external deficit towards sustainable levels on the medium term and in a bid to avoid excessive exchange rate volatility. In line of available data and given the need to ensure that interbank money market rates will continue to get closer to the monetary policy rate, the NBR Board has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 10.00 percent and to actively use open-market operations in order to ensure an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system. As part of a gradual alignment to the European Central Bank standards and in a bid to ensure sustainable financing of the Romanian economy with a focus on sectors with longer-term development prospects, the NBR Board decided to reduce the minimum reserve ratio on foreign-denominated liabilities with residual maturities of over two years to zero from 40 percent at present, starting with the May 24-June 23, 2009 maintenance period. Meanwhile, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirements ratios on leu-denominated liabilities of credit institutions as well as on foreign-currency denominated liabilities with residual maturities of up to two years. The NBR Board believes that the implementation of the balanced macroeconomic policy mix agreed under the precautionary external financing arrangement will allow a gradual and prudent adjustment of the monetary policy in line with the resumption of the disinflation process and with the consolidation of financial stability. The NBR will continue to monitor domestic and global economic developments so that through an adequate use of its available instruments to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives in what concerns attaining and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as ensuring financial stability. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for May 6, 2009, when a new quarterly Inflation Report will be analyzed."
Euroarea,2009-04-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates by a further 25 basis points. This decision brings the total reduction in the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem since 8 October 2008 to 300 basis points. Today's decision takes into account the expectation that price pressures will remain subdued, reflecting the substantial past fall in commodity prices and the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. The latest economic data and survey information confirm that the world economy, including the euro area, is undergoing a severe downturn. Both global and euro area demand are likely to remain very weak over 2009, before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing. After today's decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. The Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil, economic activity has weakened markedly in the euro area, as domestic demand has contracted in parallel with the downturn in the world economy. Available data and survey indicators suggest that economic activity in the euro area has remained very weak in early 2009. It is likely to remain very subdued for the remainder of the year but is expected to gradually recover in 2010. The substantial fall in commodity prices since the summer of 2008 is supporting real disposable income and thus consumption. In addition, external as well as domestic demand should increasingly benefit from the effects of the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as from measures taken to restore the functioning of the financial system both inside and outside the euro area. Taking these effects into account, we see the risks to this outlook for economic activity as being broadly balanced. On the one hand, there may be stronger than anticipated positive effects due to the decrease in commodity prices and to policy measures taken. On the other hand, there are concerns that the turmoil in financial markets could have a stronger impact on the real economy, as well as that protectionist pressures could intensify and that there could be adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. Annual HICP inflation has fallen further, from 1.2% in February to 0.6% in March, according to Eurostat's flash estimate As explained on earlier occasions, the decline in inflation since last summer primarily reflects the sharp fall in global commodity prices over this period. Moreover, signs of a more broad-based reduction in inflationary pressure are increasingly emerging. Looking ahead, base effects stemming from past energy price effects will play a significant role in the shorter-term dynamics of the HICP. Accordingly, we expect to see headline annual inflation rates declining further in the coming months and temporarily reaching negative levels around mid-year. Such short-term movements are, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Looking further ahead, over the policy-relevant horizon, annual HICP inflation is expected to remain below 2% in 2010, reflecting mainly ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. They relate in particular to the risks to the outlook for economic activity as well as to risks to commodity prices. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm the high month-to-month volatility of developments in M3 and its components observed since the intensification of the financial turmoil in September 2008. Looking through this volatility, the pace of monetary expansion in the euro area has continued to decelerate markedly and supports the assessment of diminishing risks to price stability in the medium term. Developments within M3 clearly reflect market participants' specific investment responses to the intensification of the financial turmoil, but increasingly also the impact of the past reduction in the key ECB interest rates. As this reduction has narrowed the gaps between the interest rates paid on the different categories of short-term deposits, it has fostered shifts in the allocation of funds. For example, the demand for overnight deposits further strengthened in February and contributed to the rise in the annual growth rate of M1 to 6.3%, while the demand for short-term time deposits weakened considerably. The flow of MFI loans to non-financial corporations and households has remained very subdued. The slightly negative flow of lending to non-financial corporations in February reflects a decline in the outstanding amount of loans with a shorter maturity, while the net flow in loans with longer maturities remained positive. The decline in short-term lending may be indicative of a reduction in loan demand related to the weakening of economic activity. However, supply effects have probably also affected loan developments. In this respect, developments over the past few months may in part reflect ongoing efforts of banks as well as the corporate and household sector to reduce the highly leveraged positions built up in past years. To sum up, today's decision takes into account the expectation that price pressures will remain subdued, reflecting the substantial past fall in commodity prices and the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. The latest economic data and survey information confirm that the world economy, including the euro area, is undergoing a severe downturn. Both global and euro area demand are likely to remain very weak over 2009, before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing. After today's decision we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. The Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policies, it is necessary that countries' commitments to a path of consolidation in order to return to sound fiscal positions are credible, respecting fully the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. This is essential to maintain the public's trust in the sustainability of public finances, which is important both for the economy to recover and for supporting long-term growth. Countries subject to the excessive deficit procedure need to comply strictly with the ECOFIN Council recommendations for correcting their deficits. Many countries will need to specify further credible consolidation measures for 2010 and beyond. Full and consistent implementation of the EU's legal provisions for sound fiscal policies is a prerequisite for the maintenance of their credibility as one of the pillars of the institutional framework of Economic and Monetary Union. Turning to structural reforms, the Governing Council welcomes the commitment of the spring European Council to make full use of the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs in the current situation. The updated recommendations for the euro area countries call for an accelerated implementation of reforms to support the economy, facilitate necessary adjustments and ensure a high level of growth potential. It remains essential that government support measures do not distort competition or delay necessary structural adjustment processes and that governments remain firmly committed to avoiding protectionism."
Nigeria,2009-04-08,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 62 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. April 08, 2009 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to review the challenges posed to the Nigerian economy by the complex mix of external and domestic economic and financial developments. The Committee recognized at the outset that external forces have had a severe impact on the Nigerian economy through trade, finance and confidence channels. The Committee, however, noted that the severity of the impact could be alleviated by undertaking appropriate economic and financial policies, taking into account the evolving international economic situation. The Committee noted that movements in crude oil prices play a critical role in the Nigerian economy. This has limited the macroeconomic and external performance of the economy since October 2008. During the first quarter of 2009, the outcomes have been mixed. Key Economic and Financial Developments The Committee reviewed the recent policy initiatives by the CBN to stabilize the foreign exchange market and to improve liquidity conditions in the domestic money market. It welcomed the staff assessment of the positive impact of these initiatives on the domestic economy, given the market view of the outlook in the context of the global economic and financial crisis. Domestic Output Provisional aggregate output growth in the first quarter of 2009 was estimated at 632 per cent by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) compared with 578 per 1 cent in the corresponding quarter of 2008. For 2009 as a whole, the NBS estimate of real output growth is 575 per cent. Compared with the growth outlook of the rest of the world, the projected domestic output growth is robust. Price Developments Inflation Inflation has been high and a matter of concern. The Committee noted the upward swing of the year-on-year headline inflation from 140 per cent in January to 146 per cent in February 2009. Core inflation, however, decelerated to 72 per cent in February from 80 per cent in January whereas food inflation rose from 184 per cent in January to 200 per cent in February. The outlook for inflation in the near term remains uncertain. Nonetheless the staff estimates indicate that inflation could decelerate to single digit by mid-2009, in response to subdued aggregate demand, lower impact of imported inflation and the near-completion of the pass- through effect of the depreciation of the Naira. Interest Rates The domestic money market rates have been under pressure since February 2009. The weighted average inter-bank call rate went up from 1762 per cent in February to 2215 per cent in March. The collateralized Open Buy Back (OBB) rate however was lower than the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR). The deposit and lending rates too have inched up. The staff expects that in the near-term, interest rates are likely to moderate in response to expected subdued inflation and 2 improvements in the liquidity conditions facilitated by the CBN initiatives in this regard. Exchange Rate The MPC noted with satisfaction the positive outcomes of measures taken recently in stabilizing the exchange rates in all the segments of the market. The demand for foreign exchange has moderated significantly in the retail Dutch Auction System and will continue to be sustained in the near term. Monetary and External Developments Provisional data indicates that broad money (M2) declined by 114 per cent in February 2009 over the end-December 2008 level. However on a year-on-year basis (February 2009 over February 2008) M2 grew by approximately 30 per cent. This was mainly on account of 44 per cent (on annualized basis) growth in credit to the private sector by end-February 2009. The order of expansion in M2 on a year- on-year basis is in line with long term trends and could be sustained in the short to medium term. The Committee noted that financial conditions in the country remain robust. There are no apparent systemic threats to the banking system. Regulatory practices and guidelines are generally in line with best practice. The Committee further noted with satisfaction the efforts being made to continuously improve upon the regulatory framework. Foreign exchange reserves position has continued to support external sustainability, facilitated by the downward movement in the overall world trade and financial flows. Policy Coordination The Committee is of the view that for monetary policy to be credible and effective, it should have the support of appropriate fiscal policy and structural reforms. The Committee therefore reaffirmed its commitment to coordinate monetary policy actions with those of fiscal and other institutional and regulatory policies. The MPC underscored the importance of the CBN acting in concert with the fiscal authorities in the efforts at addressing the global economic and financial crisis. Conclusion In conclusion, the MPC observed the relative tight monetary conditions in the economy, and hence the need for monetary easing. The major pressure points for monetary policy in the short term include: • Liquidity tightness and hence relatively higher interbank interest rates, and also pressures on other interest rates • Lower growth rate of credit to the private sector compared to the trend in the last three years • Rising food price inflation, and need for increased agricultural output • Ensuring the continuation of banking and financial sector stability and soundness 4 Decisions In view of the above, the MPC decided to: Reduce MPR from 975 per cent to 80 per cent; Reduce the liquidity ratio from 300 per cent to 250 per cent with effect from April 14, 2009; and Reduce the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) from 20 per cent to 10 per cent with effect from April 14, 2009. The MPC also commended the earlier CBN Board's decision and Mr. President's approval in respect of the N200 billion special agricultural fund for large scale agriculture. The CBN will fully underwrite the cost of the fund, and ensure immediate implementation. This initiative will significantly reduce food price inflation, and assist the CBN in achieving its core mandate of price stability. Professor Chukwuma C Soludo CFR Governor.

Thailand,2009-04-08,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 8 April 2009 Ms. Duangmanee Vongpradhip. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. The global financial crisis continued to result in a marked contraction of both the major and regional economies. In addition, the severity and duration of the crisis remained highly uncertain, which would affect the Thai economy through a contraction of exports, while private domestic demand remained weak. However public spending, through the government's fiscal stimulus measures would help compensate for the softening in private demand to some extent. The MPC assessed that, going forward, risks to growth remained. Headline and core inflation continued on a declining trend, allowing monetary policy to be eased further to support the economy and stimulate the recovery going forward. The MPC therefore decided to lower the policy interest rate by 025 per cent per annum, from 150 per cent per annum to 125 per cent per annum, effective immediately."
Chile,2009-04-09,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 9 April 2009 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to reduce the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 1.75% (annual). This decision is grounded on a projected fast decline in inflation, and brings the policy rate closer to a level consistent with the current macroeconomic environment and its related risks. Internationally, the latest data indicates that global growth prospects for this year have deteriorated further while uncertainty persists. However, stock prices have picked up and commodity prices, particularly prices of copper and oil, have risen. Domestically, available information on output for the first quarter of this year continues to post negative y-o-y variation rates, largely due to the drastic fall observed by the end of 2008. Unemployment has increased. Tight lending conditions persist, although they are reflecting the impact of the increased monetary stimulus. In March, the set of inflation indicators revealed contained inflationary pressures. Wage dynamics continue to be in line with historical patterns. Reduced annual inflation rates are foreseen for the coming quarters, while medium-term inflation expectations remain stable. The Board considers that further cuts to the monetary policy rate may be necessary. Accordingly, it reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that projected inflation will stand at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2009-04-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. Domestic economic activity has kept on declining due to the continued decrease in both domestic demand and exports, but the pace of the slowdown has moderated somewhat. The downside risk to economic growth is considered to remain as before at a high level because of the world-wide economic slump and the international financial market unrest. Consumer price inflation has been decelerating thanks to the stable movements of international oil prices coupled with the easing of demand-pull pressures owing to the economic downturn and this trend seems set to continue for some time. In the real estate market, prices and transaction volumes have continued to decline. Financial market price variables such as the exchange rate and stock prices have shown some signs of improvement. Lending to the household sector and SMEs has expanded steadily in line with the moderation in financial institutions' attitude to lending. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain accommodative policy stance for the time being and do what is needed to ward off a severe slowdown in economic activity while giving support to financial market stabilization."
Georgia,2009-04-15,"15.04.2009: The NBG Lowers its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) by 50 Basis Points, to 6 Percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on April 15, 2009 and decided to lower its main policy rate (the refinancing rate), by 50 basis points, to 6 percent. The annual rate of inflation decreased to 1.6 percent in March. As a result, average annual inflation stands at 7.8 percent. Existing forecasts have not changed considerably since the Committee's last meeting, according to which the inflation rate is expected to stay below the target. Downside risks to prices are significant. Inflation expectations remain low and core inflation is continuing to decline. The growth rates in monetary aggregates remain negative, a likely indicator of the slowdown in overall economic activity. After the introduction of foreign exchange auctions by the National Bank of Georgia at the beginning of March, increased flexibility in the exchange rate has been introduced, that reduced speculative pressures on the foreign exchange market. As was expected, activity in the direct foreign exchange market has increased markedly over the last month, which is aiding the development of the abovementioned market. Even though the inflow of foreign currency including via money transfers into the country has decreased compared to the same period last year, the volume of imports has slowed at a faster pace, which has reduced pressure on the exchange rate. Energy prices on the international markets have stabilized over the last month. There are signs that the U.S. economic downturn is easing. Despite the appearance of some positive signals, still significant uncertainty remains about the prospects for global economic growth. The NBG will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on May 13, 2009."
Peru,2009-04-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2009 BCRP REDUCED THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE TO 5.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to reduce the monetary policy reference interest rate from 6.0 to 5.0 percent, thus accumulating a reduction of 150 basis points in this rate so far this year. The decision of accelerating the reduction of the reference interest rate is based on the reduction of inflationary pressures, as a result of which the rate of inflation has declined from 6.7 percent in December to 4.8 percent in March, as well as on the deceleration observed in private spending due to inventory adjustments and the deterioration of the global economy. Should this trend persist, the Bank will continue to loosen its monetary policy stance. Inflation recorded a rate of 0.36 percent in March, as a result of which last 12-month inflation declined for the fifth consecutive month. Inflation and economic agents' expectations about inflation are expected to continue declining in the next months, thus allowing inflation's convergence to the target range in the fourth quarter of this year. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.75 percent. Overnight deposits: 4.25 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.75 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the next month on its session of May 7, 2009."
Philippines,2009-04-15,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to reduce the BSP's key policy interest rates by another 25 basis points to 4.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.5 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility, effective immediately. This rate cut brings the cumulative reduction in the BSP's key policy rates to 150 basis points since December last year. The current RRP rate is the lowest since 15 May 1992. Meanwhile, the interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also reduced accordingly. The BSP considered the latest baseline forecasts which indicated a lower inflation path over the policy horizon, with average inflation expected to settle within the target ranges in 2009 and 2010. In addition, the Monetary Board considered that, on balance, the risks to inflation are skewed to the downside given expectations of weaker global and domestic demand conditions and a low probability of a significant near-term recovery in commodity prices. Upside risks remain, however, and these are linked to the volatility in exchange rates and the prices of oil and some food products, as well as increases in utility rates. The decision to lower policy rates will help bring down the cost of borrowing and promote wider access to domestic financing. The Monetary Board also noted that, while there are initial signs of improvement, the restoration of the global financial system to normalcy may take some time. The BSP will continue to carefully monitor global and domestic developments with the view to ensuring that the monetary policy stance remains appropriate."
Turkiye,2009-04-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 10.50 percent to 9.75 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 13 percent to 12.25 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. is decreased from 6.5 percent to 5.75 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 16 percent to 15.25 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 12 percent to 11.25 percent. Recent data releases indicate that domestic economic activity has continued to slow down in the first quarter. Problems in international credit markets persist and there are no clear signs of improvement in the outlook for global economy. These developments suggest that the economic activity is not likely to recover anytime soon. Therefore, downward pressures on inflation are expected to continue. Moreover, disinflation is expected to gain pace in the near term, partly driven by the past declines in oil and other commodity prices. In light of these assessments and the partial improvement in risk indicators, the Committee has decided to cut policy rates by 75 basis points. The Committee has indicated that the rate cuts have lowered the probability of significantly undershooting the end-year inflation target. However, the tightness in financial conditions still persists to some extent, and uncertainties regarding the impact of the problems in financial markets on the real economy remain high, suggesting that downside risks still remain. The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective. Looking forward, the Committee envisages that the next rate cut may be measured, and that it may be necessary for the monetary policy to maintain an easing bias for a considerable period. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Hungary,2009-04-20,"At its meeting on 20 April 2009, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at 9.50%. The Monetary Council continues to expect that the Hungarian economy will be undergoing a sharp downturn this year. Inflation may be around the 3% target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy, due in part to discipline imposed by the economic recession on pricing behaviour. Data released over recently indicate that the outlook for economic activity in Hungary has deteriorated further. The decline in external demand and the contraction of lending led to a marked slowdown in the economy in the final quarter of 2008. The weakness of industrial production and retail sales suggests that the downturn has gathered pace. Households are adjusting to the tightening in global financial conditions and the deteriorating outlook for future incomes by curtailing consumption expenditure, which, in turn, is acting to reduce Hungary's external financing requirement. With the slowdown in the global and domestic economies, inflation has fallen substantially. The significant easing in services price inflation this year reflects the effects of declining demand. The weakening of the forint in the first months of the year has not yet fed through fully into tradables inflation. Inflationary pressures associated with exchange rate depreciation may become more pronounced over the period ahead, which, however, may be mitigated by declining demand. In the past month, global willingness to take risks has increased and sentiment towards Central and Eastern Europe in previous months has not deteriorated further. However, global and domestic financial markets continue to be extremely volatile. After considering the outlook for the real economy and inflation as well as the need to preserve the stability of the financial intermediary system, the Monetary Council decided to leave the central bank base rate unchanged."
Israel,2009-04-27,"27.4.2009</td> The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate unchanged for May 2009 The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for May 2009 will remain unchanged at 0.5 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.5 percent in March, after four months of negative changes. The increase exceeded the average of forecasters' predictions of a rise of 0.2 percent. Since the beginning of 2009 the CPI has declined by 0.1 percent, and over the last twelve months it rose by 3.6 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The averages of forecasters' predictions regarding the CPI are for an increase of 1.0 percent in April and 0.2 percent in May. Their forecasts are that inflation over the previous twelve months will return to within the target range as early as next month, and in a year's time will be around the lower limit of the range. Since the publication of the CPI for March, inflation expectations for twelve months forward derived from the capital market have risen slightly, and last week reached 0.8 percent, below the lower limit of the inflation target. Expectations derived from the capital market regarding the Bank of Israel'sinterest rate for May are for a cut of 25 basis points, and for a rate of 1.4 percent a year hence. On average, forecasters expect the interest rate for May to remain unchanged, and to be 1 percent one year hence. Real economic activity: Further to the contraction of real activity in the last quarter of 2008, initial indicators relating to the first quarter of 2009 point to a continued decline, due mainly to a fall in world demand. Last week the Bank of Israel reduced its forecast of growth in Israel in 2010 to +1 percent. The composite state-of-the-economy index for Marchshowed a reduction of 0.9 percent, continuing the reductions shown in the last few months. It is worth noting that this represents a slight increase compared with the negative trend. The Companies Survey for the first quarter of 2008, to be published in the next few days, shows further contraction of activity. For the next quarter, however, participants in the survey expect a more moderate decline than that in the first quarter. The Purchasing Managers Index also indicates a low level of activity, although in the last two months it showed some improvement, following its sharp fall in January. The labor market and wages: The crisis is affecting the labor market, but with a lag. The unemployment rate rose in January to 6.8 percent. In the first quarter of 2009 claims for unemployment benefit increased by 20 percent, and in March alone, by 10 percent. The Employers Survey for the first quarter presents a similar picture: the employment gap, i.e., the difference between the number of positions filled and the number of terminations of employment, deteriorated seriously, with a negative balance of 40,000, compared with a negative 10,000 in the previous survey. Despite the weakness in the labor market, the average wage per employee post increased by 1.1 percent in January. Budget data: The budget deficit (excluding credit) in the first quarter of 2009 was NIS 4.8 billion, in contrast to large surpluses in the first quarter of every year since 2004. Deducting the effect of changes in tax rates, in the first quarter of 2009 tax revenues fell by a real 16 percent compared with the first quarter of 2008. The need to ensure the continuation of the downward path for the deficit and an expenditure constraint appears as one of the principles of the economic program presented by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the monetary policy discussions of 22 March and 26 April, the shekel weakened against thedollar by 4.8 percent, and against the euro by 2.3 percent. In terms of the index of the effective exchange rate vis-?-vis the currencies of Israel'strading partners (weighted by the volume of trade), the shekel weakened by 4.9 percent. The weakness of the shekel against the dollar was mainly the result of the strengthening of the dollar against the major currencies and of the Bank of Israel's announcement that it was continuing its daily purchases of foreign currency. The capital and money markets: Between the interest rate discussions of 22 March and 26 April the Tel Aviv 25 share price index rose by 12 percent and the Tel Aviv 100 index by 13 percent. In this period stock markets around the world generally recorded sharp increases. In the first two weeks of the period, in light of the Bank's announcement that it was increasing the scale of its purchases of government bonds, the yield curve flattened and yields fell, in contrast with the rising yield trend around the world. In the second half of the period, however, yields started rising, with a marked widening of the gap between long-term and short-term yields. Over the whole of the period from the previous interest rate discussions to the present ones, yields on unindexed 10-year Israeli government bonds rose by 0.21 percentage points to 4.80 percent, and on US government 10-year bonds by 0.36 percentage points to 2.99 percent, so that over the period as a wholethe yield gap between the Israeli bonds and US government bonds contractedto 1.81 percentage points. Yields on Israeli corporate bonds fell. The Tel-Bond 20 index increased by 4.4 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 6.4 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, dropped relatively sharply from 2.45 percent to 1.8 percent. The CDSspreads of emerging market countries also narrowed. The world economy: The weakness in the global economy continued. That said, there are signs that the rate of deterioration is easing, and there may be the first indications that the situation is stabilizing, expressed mainly in the real estate market, consumption, some confidence indices published in the US, and data arriving from China. Most of the data relatingto the global economy, in general, continue to be negative, in particular data of production, exports and unemployment. The IMF forecasts are that world output will decline in 2009, for the first time since the Great Depression. The OECD expects a 4.3 percent reduction in its members' GDP in 2009. Stock markets around the world continued to rise steeply this month, indicating that the financial markets consider that the global economy will return to a growth path earlier than assessed previously. Inflation: Global inflation in the next few months is expected to be lower than desired, and possibly even negative. Central banks that have not yet reached zero interest rates are continuing to cut their rates. At the same time, central banks andgovernments around the world are persisting with the exceptional measures they introduced and with their programs to boost activity. Nevertheless, the view is being expressed abroad that a strategy needs to be formulated that would enable a less expansionary monetary policy to be pursued. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate unchanged for May at its currentlow level, together with the exceptional measures the Bank is taking--purchases in the foreign currency market and the government bond market--will help strengthen the economy's ability to cope with the effects of the global economic crisis. The decision willserve to support real economic activity, the stability of the financial system, and the achievement of the inflation target. The main considerations behind the decision are: The risks that the economy will slide into deflation have declined, and in the currentcircumstances the probability that inflation will return to within the target range by the end of the year has increased. The effectof the low rate of interest combined with the other instruments that the Bank is using is evident in the financial system, among other things in the easing of the cost of credit. At this stage of the crisis, the conditions created by the Bank of Israel's policy are serving to moderate the effects of the global crisis and to help the economy recover from it. Negative data continue to arrive that indicate further contraction of activity, but atthe same time other data point to a moderation in the rate of decline. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments, and will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives-- the encouragement of employment and growth, price stability, and support for the stability of the financial system. 27.4.2009</td> The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate unchanged for May 2009. The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate unchanged for May 2009. The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for May 2009 will remain unchanged at 0.5 percent. Background conditions.

Malaysia,2009-04-29,"At the Monetary Policy Committee meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 2.00 percent. The global economic conditions deteriorated further in the first quarter of 2009, while conditions in the international financial system have yet to normalise. Although there are tentative signs of a slower pace of decline in a number of economic indicators in recent months, major advanced economies are still experiencing a deepening economic contraction. Regional economies have also recorded a sharp economic slowdown in the first quarter. While the near-term economic outlook will continue to remain weak, the implementation of large stimulus measures by several countries has increased the prospects for economic conditions to improve in the second half of the year. Further progress in the financial sector resolution has also been made in several advanced economies, the success of which is a key precondition for the stabilisation of economic and financial conditions. The sharply adverse global developments have resulted in steep declines in Malaysia's exports and industrial production, which have in turn affected private sector activity and labour market conditions. The economy, therefore, is expected to record a marked contraction in the first quarter of 2009. These conditions are expected to prevail until the second quarter of the year. Nevertheless, some signs of moderation in the pace of decline in economic activity have emerged. The current assessment is that the domestic economy is expected to improve in the second half of 2009, supported by stabilisation in global economic conditions and the larger impetus from the implementation of the fiscal stimulus measures. Meanwhile, inflation decelerated to 3.5 percent in March, and is expected to moderate further amid subdued demand conditions and lower external price pressures. Going forward, the implementation of the fiscal stimulus measures, and the accommodative monetary environment following the previous reductions in the OPR, will provide support to domestic economic activity. The Malaysian financial system remains strong and the monetary transmission process is functioning to deliver the impact of the policy stimulus to the economy. An acceleration of the implementation of the fiscal measures would raise the prospects for an earlier resumption of positive growth in the Malaysian economy. The current assessment is that the accumulated monetary policy measures are sufficient to provide support to domestic demand. Continued attention will be given to ensure an adequate flow of credit to all segments of the economy. In addition, access to the bond market by the private sector will be further enhanced by the establishment of the Financial Guarantee Institution. Liquidity in the financial system remains sufficient to support the demand for financing from both the private and public sectors. Bank Negara Malaysia will monitor closely and assess the evolving developments in setting future monetary and financial policies. Bank Negara Malaysia 29 April 2009."
Poland,2009-04-29,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 29 April 2009 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 28-29 April 2009 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 5.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 2.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 4.00% on an annual basis. Data released recently confirm low economic activity in Poland. Decline in manufacturing, exports and retail sales in the first months of 2009 points to a slightly lower GDP growth in 2009 Q1 than previously forecast. At the same time, the data on economic situation abroad confirm that recession in Poland's major trading partners has deepened. Similarly to other countries, lower demand connected with deteriorated sentiment of economic agents and their worsened financial condition, driven by limited credit availability stemming from increased risk aversion in the financial sector and considerable tightening of banks' lending conditions, contribute to slowing economic growth in Poland. Amidst persisting excess liquidity of the banking sector, as a result of increased risk premium, the cost of credit, despite certain reduction, remains at a relatively high level. At the same time, information on labour market developments points to the further decline in employment and increase in unemployment, which is conducive to curbing inflationary pressure. The recent period was marked by still heightened exchange rate volatility of currencies of Central and Eastern European countries, as well as currencies of developed economies. This has also affected the zloty exchange rate. In March 2009 the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland increased to 3.6%, thus it remained above the inflation target of 2.5% and slightly exceeded the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. The rise in inflation was mainly driven by increasing food prices and rising prices within the recreation and culture category which was connected, to a certain extent, with the previously observed considerable depreciation of the zloty. At the same time all core inflation indices increased. Considerable rise in the prices of energy and services related to maintenance of dwelling, observed in the first two months of 2009, was the main factor contributing to the annual price growth remaining at an increased level. In the Council's assessment, inflation in the coming months is likely to temporarily remain at an elevated level, mainly as a result of the relatively high growth of food prices and a rise in administered prices, primarily prices of energy. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. In the medium term, the recession in the global economy bringing about the decline in the domestic economic growth will lower the inflationary pressure in Poland. Gradual deterioration of the situation in the labour market and of financial condition of enterprises as well as tightening of banks' lending conditions will also be conducive to curbing demand and, consequently, inflationary pressure. On the other hand, the previously observed considerable depreciation of the zloty exchange rate will drive price increases. The Council assessed the probability of inflation running below the target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running above the target. The Council's decisions in the coming months will take account of the incoming information on the outlook for economic growth, inflation and situation in the financial markets in Poland and abroad and information on zloty exchange rate developments. The Council will analyse the impact of developments in the domestic interbank market on the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Poland. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts necessary for the euro adoption in Poland."
United States,2009-04-29,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the economy has continued to contract, though the pace of contraction appears to be somewhat slower. Household spending has shown signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Weak sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories, fixed investment, and staffing. Although the economic outlook has improved modestly since the March meeting, partly reflecting some easing of financial market conditions, economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time. Nonetheless, the Committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability. In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued. Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. As previously announced, to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year. In addition, the Federal Reserve will buy up to $300 billion of Treasury securities by autumn. The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is facilitating the extension of credit to households and businesses and supporting the functioning of financial markets through a range of liquidity programs. The Committee will continue to carefully monitor the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of financial and economic developments.

South Africa,2009-04-30,"1.1 The global economy continues to be in the midst of a severe synchronised downturn with a number of countries already experiencing recession. The G-20 countries, including South Africa, have committed themselves to a programme of action in order to contribute toward the earliest possible global economic recovery. Despite a generally positive response to the G-20 summit in April, it has become increasingly accepted that the slowdown is likely to be severe and protracted, and that the global recovery is likely to be gradual. 1.2 Domestic output and expenditure growth are declining or negative, and the growth outlook is dependent to a significant extent on a broader global recovery. Despite the widening domestic output gap, inflation remains sticky but is expected to continue on its downward path. 2.1 The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas increased to 8,6 per cent in February 2009 and then moderated to 8,5 per cent in March. Food price inflation continued its downward trend, increasing at a year-on-year rate of 14,7 per cent in March, compared with 15,8 per cent in the previous month. Food prices remained the largest contributor to the inflation outcome, contributing 2,3 percentage points. The largest price increase was recorded by electricity and other fuels which increased by 30,1 per cent. Significant increases were also recorded in the prices of tobacco, housing maintenance and repairs, health, recreation and culture, and education. Countervailing pressure came from petrol prices which declined by 14,9 per cent, despite the petrol price increase of 45 cents per litre in March. 2.2 Producer price inflation, which reached 19,1 per cent in August 2008, continued its downward trend, measuring 7,3 per cent and 5,3 per cent in February and March 2009 respectively. Prices of agricultural food products declined at a year-on-year rate of 2,1 per cent in March, while manufactured food price inflation moderated to 9,4 per cent. 3.1 The most recent central forecast of the Bank shows a near-term deterioration in the inflation outlook but inflation is expected to follow a downward trend and to average 5,4 per cent at the end of the forecast period in the final quarter of 2010. The slightly higher expected trend is a result of revised assumptions about administered prices and the higher-than-anticipated inflation outcome for February. 3.2 Inflation expectations show a mixed picture. The inflation expectations survey which is conducted on behalf of the Bank by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University reflects somewhat divergent inflation expectations between the different groups of respondents. In the survey conducted in the first quarter of 2009, average CPI inflation expectations for 2009 declined from 8,6 per cent to 8,3 per cent. Expectations ranged from 6,1 per cent for analysts, to 9,7 per cent for trade unionists. Inflation is expected to average 8,0 per cent in 2010, up from the 7,5 per cent measured in the previous survey. While analysts expect inflation to average 5,4 per cent in 2010, business executives and trade union officials expect inflation to average 8,6 per cent and 10,1 per cent respectively. Inflation is expected to moderate to 7,8 per cent in 2011. 3.3 Wage settlements, which generally follow inflation trends with a lag, have also edged up slightly. According to the Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the level of wage settlements increased by 10,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2009, compared to the 2008 average of 9,8 per cent. Nominal unit labour cost increased over four quarters by 12,8 per cent in the final quarter of 2008. Nominal wage settlements are expected to moderate somewhat as the inflation rate declines. According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics survey by Statistics South Africa, in the fourth quarter of 2008, employment levels showed their first decline in four years. 3.4 The risks to the inflation outlook as assessed by the MPC have remained relatively unchanged since the previous meeting of the committee, although the recent appreciation of the rand exchange rate, if sustained, may have reduced the degree of the upside risk to the inflation outlook. The rand exchange rate remains affected by changes in global risk aversion, but there has been a decline in the degree of volatility. Since the positive market reaction to the G-20 summit in early April, sentiment towards emerging market economies in general has improved and most emerging market currencies have appreciated against the US dollar. 3.5 As noted earlier, the global economy remains under pressure despite fiscal and monetary stimuli in many countries. In January 2009 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasted global growth of 0,5 per cent and 3,0 per cent for 2009 and 2010 respectively. The IMF now expects global output to contract by 1,3 per cent in 2009, before recovering gradually to 1,9 per cent in 2010. The advanced economies are expected to contract by 3,8 per cent while the emerging and developing economies are expected to experience positive growth of 1,6 per cent, with China and India expected to grow by 6,5 per cent and 4,5 per cent respectively. The growth forecast for Africa has been reduced from 3,4 per cent to 2,0 per cent. The risks to these forecasts are seen to be on the downside, given the current heightened levels of uncertainty. World trade has also declined and is expected to contract by a further 9,5 per cent in 2009. 3.6 World inflation is expected to remain subdued as a result of these growth trends and lower commodity prices. World inflation is expected to average 2,5 per cent in 2009 and 2,4 per cent in 2010. Although a number of commodity prices have recovered somewhat from their lows in the fourth quarter of 2008, they are expected to be restrained by the weak global demand. The price of North Sea Brent crude oil declined to around US$35 per barrel in late December 2008 but has been trading at around the US$50 per barrel level for most of April 2009. During this month, the higher international oil product prices have been more or less offset by the appreciation of the rand against the US dollar, and the domestic price of petrol is expected to remain relatively unchanged in May. 3.7 The outlook for domestic economic growth remains subdued, with no indications of a quick recovery. The high frequency data continue to suggest that the negative conditions recorded in the final quarter of 2008 persisted in the first quarter of 2009. The physical volume of manufacturing production declined at a year-on-year rate of 15,0 per cent in February, following an 11,1 per cent contraction in the previous month. The outlook for manufacturing remains negative, with the Investec/BER Purchasing Managers Index declining further in March. Total mining production declined at a year-on-year rate of 12,8 per cent in February, while the real value of building plans approved declined by 42,7 per cent over the same period. 3.8 The sluggish domestic demand conditions also appear to have persisted. Wholesale trade sales declined at a year-on-year rate of 8,9 per cent in February while retail sales declined by 4,5 per cent following a modest increase in January. Total new vehicle sales declined by 30,3 per cent in March, reflecting the continued weak demand for durable goods. However, the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index, while still at low levels, showed an increase in the first quarter of 2009. Falling house prices and weak asset markets are also expected to restrain consumption expenditure. 3.9 Domestic credit extension continues to reflect the declining trend in domestic expenditure as well as more stringent credit criteria being applied by banks with respect to loans to both households and companies. Year-on-year growth in total loans and advances to the private sector declined to 10,2 per cent in February and 7,3 per cent in March 2009. The quarterly growth declined from 6,2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 0,1 per cent in the first quarter of 2009. Instalment sale credit and leasing finance reflected the weak demand for durable goods, with increases of 3,1 per cent in February and 1,6 per cent in March. 3.10 In line with the previous MPC statement, the committee assesses the main risks to the inflation outlook to emanate from cost-push pressures, particularly administered prices, which include the risk of higher-than-expected electricity tariff increases. Food price inflation at the consumer price level, which has remained relatively unresponsive to lower inflation at the producer price level, appears to show signs of moderation. Should this downward trend accelerate, it could have a significant downward impact on the inflation trajectory. 4.1 The Monetary Policy Committee considered the severe synchronised downturn in international and domestic economic conditions and noted their potential future downward impact on inflation, notwithstanding the higher-than-expected recent domestic inflation outcomes. The committee is of the view that the adverse economic conditions continue to tilt the balance of risks to the inflation outlook to the downside over the medium term and has therefore decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 100 basis points to 8,5 per cent per annum with effect from 4 May 2009."
Romania,2009-05-06,"In its meeting of May 6, 2009, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for May 7, 2009. The annual inflation rate fell slightly to 6.71 percent in March 2009 from 6.89 percent in February amid a slowdown of the growth in services prices. The adjusted annual CORE2 inflation - calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruits, eggs and fuel) as well as the effects of vice tax - also fell, its annual rate sliding to 6.2 percent in March 2009 from 6.6 percent in February and 6.3 percent in December 2008. Nevertheless, inflation remains above the upper limit of the variation band around the annual target. The analysis of macroeconomic and financial indicators shows a significant slowdown of economic growth against the background of deepening of the global crisis as well as the ongoing, rapid adjustment of the external imbalance, which however has yet to reach sustainable longer-term levels. In the monetary area, it is worth noting the beginning of a negative adjustment of credit to the private sector, which is partially offset by the dynamics of government credit. The relatively moderation of volatility of the leu exchange rate was a result of an improvement of financial investors' sentiment regarding the Romanian economy, especially against the background of Romania concluding the multilateral external financing arrangement with the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and other international financial institutions. Moreover, interbank money market rates have come closer to the monetary policy rate, the improved assessment of country risk along with the relative alleviation of uncertainties providing a perspective that this process will continue. In light of the available data and given the need to ensure real broad monetary conditions appropriate for both the achievement of medium-term inflation goals and for a sustainable revival of the lending process in the Romanian economy, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 9.5 percent per annum from 10.00 percent. Consequently, starting May 7, 2009, the rate on the deposit facility will be lowered to 5.5 percent per annum from 6.0 percent and the rate on the credit facility (Lombard) will be 13.5 percent per annum versus 14.00 percent. At the same time, the penalty rate for deficits of leu-denominated minimum reserve requirements will drop to 20.25 percent from 21 percent, starting with the May 24-June 23, 2009 maintenance period. The NBR Board has also decided to continue to actively use open-market operations in order to ensure an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and to leave unchanged the minimum reserve requirements ratios on both leu-denominated and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions, at 18 percent and 40 percent respectively. We reiterate that on March 31, 2009 the NBR Board decided to cut to zero the minimum reserve ratio on foreign-denominated liabilities with residual maturities of over two years, starting with the May 24-June 23, 2009 maintenance period. The NBR Board has also examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses the recent macroeconomic context, analyzes the inflation outlook and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The prospects show a continuation of the disinflation process, despite the persistence of some significant uncertainties and in the context of a relative alleviation of risks associated with the ongoing adjustment of macroeconomic imbalances amid a recent significant correction in the trade and current account deficits and the conclusion of the multilateral external financing arrangement with the IMF, the EU and other international financial institutions. In this context, a consolidation of disinflation and of financial stability requires the firm and consistent implementation of the coherent economic - monetary, fiscal and income - policy mix as well as of the agreed structural reforms. The NBR Board is restating that it will closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as to ensure, by using its available instruments, the fulfilment of its objectives in what concerns attaining and maintaining price stability in the medium term, as well as consolidating financial stability in a sustainable manner. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for May 7, 2009. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for June 30, 2009."
Chile,2009-05-07,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 7 May 2009 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to reduce the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 1.25% (annual). Internationally, some recent data suggest that global growth prospects for this year have tended to stabilize. Although uncertainty persists, stock markets have picked up and commodity prices, particularly prices of copper and oil, have risen. Domestically, available information on output for the first quarter of this year continues to post negative y-o-y variation rates, largely due to the drastic fall observed by the end of 2008. Unemployment has increased. Tight lending conditions persist, although they are reflecting the impact of the increased monetary stimulus. In April, the set of inflation indicators showed reduced inflationary pressures. Wage dynamics continue to be in line with historical patterns. Low annual inflation rates are foreseen for the coming quarters, while medium-term inflation expectations remain stable. The Board does not rule out the need for cutting further of the monetary policy rate. Accordingly, it reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that projected inflation will stand at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2009-05-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to reduce the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by a further 25 basis points and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 50 basis points, to 1.00% and 1.75% respectively. The interest rate on the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.25%. This decision brings the total reduction in the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem since 8 October 2008 to 325 basis points. Current key ECB interest rates are appropriate taking into account all available information and analysis. In addition to the reductions in interest rates, the Governing Council decided today to proceed with its enhanced credit support approach. In continuity and consistency with the operations we have undertaken since October 2008, and in recognition of the central role played by the banking system in financing the euro area economy, we will conduct liquidity-providing longer-term refinancing operations with a maturity of 12 months. The operations will be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rate for the first of these operations, to be announced on 23 June 2009, will be the rate on the main refinancing operations at that time. Subsequently, the fixed rate may include a premium to the rate on the main refinancing operations, depending on the circumstances at the time. The Governing Council has decided in principle that the Eurosystem will purchase euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area. The detailed modalities will be announced after the Governing Council meeting of 4 June 2009. Furthermore, the Governing Council has decided that the European Investment Bank will become an eligible counterparty in the Eurosystem's monetary policy operations with effect from 8 July 2009 and under the same conditions as any other counterparty. These decisions have been taken to promote the ongoing decline in money market term rates, to encourage banks to maintain and expand their lending to clients, to help to improve market liquidity in important segments of the private debt security market, and to ease funding conditions for banks and enterprises. Today's decisions take into account the expectation that price developments will continue to be dampened by the substantial past fall in commodity prices and the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. The latest economic data and survey information suggest tentative signs of a stabilisation at very low levels, after a first quarter which was significantly weaker than expected. The world economy, including the euro area, is still undergoing a severe downturn, with the prospect of both external and domestic demand remaining very weak over 2009 before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. This assessment incorporates a number of adverse developments which are likely to materialise over the coming months, such as a further deterioration in labour markets. At the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing, as money and credit growth have further decelerated in recent months. Against the background of these developments, after today's decisions we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Let me now explain our assessment in some more detail, starting with the economic analysis. Reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil, economic activity continued to weaken in the euro area in the course of the first quarter of 2009, in parallel with the ongoing downturn in the world economy. This weakening in the first quarter appears to have been significantly more pronounced than projected in March. More recently, there have been some tentative signs in survey data of a stabilisation, albeit at very low levels. Overall, economic activity is likely to be very weak for the remainder of this year, before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. In particular, the substantial fall in commodity prices since the summer of 2008 is supporting real disposable income and thus consumption. In addition, external as well as domestic demand should increasingly benefit from the effects of the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as from the measures taken so far to restore the functioning of the financial system both inside and outside the euro area. Taking all these measures and their effects into account, as well as the pronouncedly negative growth in the first quarter of this year and the most recently published forecasts by public institutions, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. On the downside, there are concerns that the turmoil in financial markets could have a stronger impact on the real economy, as well as that protectionist pressures could intensify and that there could be adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. At the same time, there may be stronger than anticipated positive effects due to the decrease in commodity prices and to the policy measures taken. Annual HICP inflation was, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, 0.6% in April, unchanged from March. As explained on earlier occasions, the decline in inflation since last summer primarily reflects the sharp fall in global commodity prices over this period. Moreover, signs of a more broad-based reduction in inflationary pressure are increasingly emerging. Looking ahead, base effects stemming from past energy price movements will play a significant role in the shorter-term dynamics of the HICP. Accordingly, we expect to see headline annual inflation rates declining further and temporarily remaining at negative levels for some months around mid-year. Thereafter, annual inflation rates are expected to increase again. Such short-term dynamics are, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Looking further ahead. HICP inflation is likely to remain positive and below 2% in 2010, with price developments being dampened by ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. They relate in particular to the risks to the outlook for economic activity as well as to risks to commodity prices. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm the continued deceleration in the pace of underlying monetary expansion. This is signalled, for instance, by the concurrent further declines in the annual growth rates of M3 to 5.1% and of loans to the private sector to 3.2%. The deceleration supports the assessment of diminishing inflationary pressures in the medium term. Month-on-month developments in M3 and its components have remained volatile, with data for March showing a contraction in most of the respective outstanding amounts. This may partly reflect market participants' investment responses to the past reduction in the key ECB interest rates, which has reduced the remuneration of short-term deposits and marketable instruments and fostered corresponding shifts in the allocation of funds not only within M3 but also to instruments outside M3. The outstanding amount of MFI loans to the private sector contracted further in March, reflecting mainly a negative flow of lending to non-financial corporations. The reduced amount of financing is again related mainly to loans with shorter maturities, while the net flow of loans with longer maturities remained positive. The decline in short-term lending is likely to reflect to a large extent lower demand in the wake of a sharp deterioration in economic activity and business prospects at the start of the year. Interest rates on short-term and floating rate bank loans to households and non-financial corporations have declined significantly over recent months, indicating that the transmission of monetary policy impulses to the economy continues. Overall, the latest money and credit data support the assessment that both banks and money-holding sectors are reducing their highly leveraged positions built up in past years. To sum up, the Governing Council's decisions today take into account the expectation that price developments will continue to be dampened by the substantial past fall in commodity prices and the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. The latest economic data and survey information suggest tentative signs of a stabilisation at very low levels, after a first quarter which was significantly weaker than expected. The world economy, including the euro area, is still undergoing a severe downturn, with the prospect of both external and domestic demand remaining very weak over 2009 before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. This assessment incorporates a number of adverse developments which are likely to materialise over the coming months, such as a further deterioration in labour markets. At the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressure has been diminishing, as money and credit growth have further decelerated in recent months. Against the background of these developments, after today's decisions we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. All in all, since the intensification of the financial crisis in September 2008, the Eurosystem has taken a series of measures that are unprecedented in nature, scope and timing. As a consequence, we have observed a clear decline in key money market interest rates that euro area banks typically use as benchmarks to reset floating rate loans and price new short-term loans. This in turn has led to sharp declines in rates for such loans to households and non-financial corporations. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full. Hence, with all the measures taken, monetary policy has provided ongoing support for households and corporations. The Governing Council will ensure that, once the macroeconomic environment improves, the measures taken can be quickly unwound and the liquidity provided absorbed so that any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term can be effectively countered in a timely fashion. Indeed, as has been stressed many times, the Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policies, the latest projections for euro area countries point to continued revisions to budget balance estimates and forecasts. Higher budget deficits and the fiscal impact of financial sector support measures will lead to significantly higher government debt-to-GDP ratios. In addition, updated projections by the Economic Policy Committee of the EU show that most countries face a challenging task in dealing with the budgetary costs of an ageing population. Therefore, it is paramount that countries make a strong and credible commitment to a path of consolidation in order to return to sound fiscal positions, respecting fully the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. This will preserve the public's trust in the sustainability of public finances and will support both the recovery and long-term economic growth. The credibility of fiscal consolidation commitments will be strengthened if they are part of national policy frameworks oriented to the medium term. Turning to structural policies, it is crucial that the focus is now on strengthening the adjustment capacity and flexibility of the euro area economy in line with the principle of an open market economy. This calls for an accelerated implementation of labour market reforms to facilitate appropriate wage-setting and labour mobility across sectors and regions as well as product market reforms to foster competition and speed up restructuring."
South Korea,2009-05-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. The pace of the domestic economic slowdown has moderated thanks to the narrowing scale of the decline in exports and proactive fiscal and monetary policy strive although domestic demand remains sluggish. The downside risk to economic growth is thought to persist because of the sustained world-wide economic slump and the deterioration of labor market conditions. Consumer price inflation has been decelerating thanks to stable international oil prices coupled with the easing of demand-pull pressures owing to the economic downturn, and this trend seems set to continue for some time. In the real estate market, prices have shown upward movements in some part of Seoul and its surrounding areas in line with the increase in transaction volumes. Financial market price variables such as the exchange rate and stock prices have continued to improve. Lending to the household sector and SMEs has expanded steadily, but concerns about credit risk and the shortermism of market funds continue. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain accommodative policy stance for the time being and do what is needed to give support to economic recovery while helping bring about financial market stabilization."
Georgia,2009-05-13,"13.05.2009 The NBG maintains its main Policy Rate (Refinansing Rate) unchanged at 6 Percent The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on May 13, 2009 and decided to maintain its main policy rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 6 percent. The annual rate of inflation in April has increased to 1.8 percent. The average annual inflation stands at 6.9 percent. The existing risks to inflation have not changed noticeably since the Committee's last meeting. Low level of inflation is likely to prevail during 2009. After the introduction of foreign exchange auctions the situation on the foreign exchange market stabilized and the need for the NBG interventions decreased, accordingly the NBG interventions fell down. As for the future, the NBG plans to intervene only through the foreign exchange auctions, and the official exchange rate will be determined based on the transactions recorded on the interbank foreign exchange market. Implementing these measures will stimulate the development of money market and reduce dollarization, which will increase the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism. There are several positive signs of easing economic downturn on the world market, which was reflected in the price increases on several commodities among which are metals and oil products. The NBG will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on June 24, 2009."
Egypt,2009-05-14,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release May 14, 2009 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to cut its overnight deposit rate by 50 bps to 95 percent per annum and its overnight lending rate by 100 bps to 11 percent per annu. The discount rate was also cut by 50 bps to 95 percent per annu. In its meeting held on May 14, 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut its overnight deposit rate by 50 bps to 95 percent and the overnight lending rate by 100 bps to 11 percen. Accordingly the width of the corridor has been narrowed from 2 percent to 15 percen. Annual headline CPI inflation continued to decline in April 2009, reaching 117 percent down from 135 percent and 121 percent in February and March, respectivel. This records a cumulative drop of 119 percentage points since its peak in August 200. The downward trend in headline inflation comes on the back of the decline in domestic food inflation, which fell from 31 percent (y/y) in August 2008 to 137 percent (y/y) in April 200. However it is important to emphasize that the sharp retrenchment in international commodity prices, which had begun in the second half of 2008, has not been fully reflected in domestic price levels due to the downward price rigidities in domestic market. While annual headline inflation is still elevated, the lower inflationary pressures driven by lower international food prices and slower domestic economic growth currently project that annual inflation will fall towards the CBE's comfort zone by mid-200. In the meantime, domestic GDP growth softened during the first half of 2008/09, a consequence of the global economic slowdow. Going forward, the dire prospects for global growth in 2009 are likely to exert further downward pressures on external demand with unfavorable repercussions on the domestic growth outloo. Against this background, the MPC judged that narrowing the width of the corridor is appropriate at this junctur. The MPC will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global economic turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objectiv.

Turkiye,2009-05-14,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 9.75 percent to 9.25 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 12.25 percent to 11.75 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. is decreased from 5.75 percent to 5.25 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 15.25 percent to 14.75 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 11.25 percent to 10.75 percent. Recent data releases point to a partial recovery in private consumption demand. However, problems in international credit markets persist and there are no significant signs of improvement in the outlook for global economy. External demand remains weak while domestic investment demand continues to contract. These developments suggest that the economic activity and employment are not likely to recover anytime soon. Therefore, downward pressures on inflation are expected to prevail for some time. Moreover, past declines in oil and other commodity prices inflation are likely to further contribute to disinflation in the near term. In light of these assessments, the Committee believes that recent developments are consistent with the outlook presented in the April Inflation Report and has decided to cut policy rates by 50 basis points. The Committee has indicated that the rate cuts have lowered the probability of significantly undershooting the medium term inflation targets. However, the tightness in financial conditions still persists to some extent, and uncertainties regarding the impact of the problems in financial markets on the real economy persist, suggesting that downside risks still remain. Looking forward, the Committee envisages that the next rate cut may be measured, and that it seems necessary for the monetary policy to maintain an easing bias for a considerable period. The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Peru,2009-05-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2009 BCRP REDUCED THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE TO 4.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to reduce the monetary policy reference interest rate for the fourth consecutive month, from 5.0 to 4.0 percent, as a result of which this rates accumulates a reduction of 250 basis points so far this year. With this decision, the Central Bank continues loosening its monetary policy stance based on the reduction of both inflation which has declined from 6.7 percent in December to 4.6 percent in April and inflation expectations, as well as on the higher deceleration observed in private spending due to inventory adjustments and the deterioration of the global economy. Should this trend persist, the Bank will continue loosening its monetary policy stance. Inflation recorded a rate of 0.02 percent in April, as a result of which last 12-month inflation declined for the fifth consecutive month since December. Inflation and inflation expectations are expected to continue declining in the next months, thus allowing inflation's convergence to the target range in the fourth quarter of this year. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent. Overnight deposits: 3.20 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the next month on its session of June 4, 2009."
Thailand,2009-05-20,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 20 May 2009 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Deputy Governor. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. The global financial crisis continued to put downward pressure on economic activities in the major and regional economies. However international financial markets had started to show signs of stabilization. Monetary and fiscal policies in several countries began to show their effects, which would help the global economy recover going forward. As for the Thai economy, the MPC assessed that a number of economic indicators started to show a more moderate contraction while inflation continued to be subdued. Moreover the impetus from fiscal measures became more evident, with an increasing disbursement rate of public expenditure, which would help shore up economic activities. Nevertheless downside risks to economic recovery remained. The MPC viewed that monetary policy had been substantially eased. The current policy interest rate of 125 per cent per annum was low and would continue to aid the process of economic recovery. The MPC therefore decided to maintain the policy interest rate at 125 per cent per annum. In the meantime, the committee would continue to monitor closely the uncertainty surrounding both domestic and external economic conditions, and would stand ready to implement appropriate monetary policy to ensure economic expansion in the periods ahead."
Nigeria,2009-05-21,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 63 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. May 21, 2009 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had a meeting yesterday and reviewed money and foreign exchange market developments. The Committee noted that there was a need to address the problem of excess liquidity in the system without necessarily putting pressure on interest rates. The MPC noted that the exchange rates have remained stable at both the official and the parallel market rates for some months now. However there has remained a wide premium between the official and parallel market rates. The MPC observed that the medium term outlook for the forex market was stable. Consequently the MPC decided to review the series of controls instituted in the last few months, and over the next three months return to fully liberalized regime that we had before the recent controls. We believe that the premium between the parallel and official exchange rates will narrow significantly in the days ahead, and we can sustain the changes over time. The CBN is also exploring the possibility of introducing futures and swaps in the foreign exchange market. Decisions Consequently, the MPC decided as follows: 1. To issue short-term instruments to be synchronized with the Debt Management Office's (DMO) issuance of the FGN Bonds to mop-up excess liquidity in the system. To return to a regime of fully liberalized foreign exchange market over the next three months. As a first set of measures towards the return to Wholesale Dutch Auction System (wDAS), the Committee decided to increase the net foreign exchange open position (NOP) for banks from 10 to 25 per cent with immediate effect, while keeping in view the possibility of raising it further at the end of June 2009. Banks are no longer mandatorily required to sell to the CBN, after 5 days, funds sourced from non-rDAS and non-oil export proceeds and may use such funds for interbank transactions. Removal of the requirement that banks transact foreign exchange at 10 per cent around the CBN rate. The CBN will now participate in the interbank foreign exchange market at the prevailing rate. Effective June 1, 2009, rDAS will be twice weekly. Approval-in-Principle (AIP) has been granted to 50 non-bank Class ‘A' BDCs. The list of the BDCs will be published from Saturday. May 23, 2009. As from next week (week beginning from May 25, 2009), about US$60 million will be sold to the BDCs per week. The BDCs are expected to sell at retail rate of not more than 20 per cent above the CBN selling rate. Government Agencies and Oil Companies will have discretion to sell foreign exchange at the interbank foreign exchange market or to the CBN with effect from May 25, 2009.

Hungary,2009-05-25,"At its meeting on 25 May 2009, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 9.5%. The Council discussed the May 2009 issue of the Bank's Quarterly Report on Inflation. The outlook for the world economy have continued to weaken in recent months. The economic downturn in Hungary is likely to be deeper than the European average, as the slowdown in activity abroad, the tightening of credit supply and the Government's fiscal measures are acting as a drag on growth simultaneously. Domestic inflation may drop below the Bank's medium-term target as a result of the sharp downturn in activity, after allowing for the temporary effects of tax changes. Data released over the past quarter indicated a further deterioration in the outlook for the domestic economy. World trade fell by nearly one-fifth in the first few months of 2009. Based on the latest data, however, the slow recovery in business expectations and de-stocking may suggest that business conditions have been stabilising. The slowdown in Europe has had unusually adverse effects on the external trade sector, due to the composition of Hungarian exports. The Government's actions to improve competitiveness, coupled with the real depreciation of the forint over the recent period, have been only partly successful in offsetting the decline in external demand. The Hungarian economy is only expected to recover in 2011, in line with the outlook for growth in Europe. Domestic firms have frozen wages, sharply reduced employment and postponed investment decisions in response to their worsening sales prospects. But despite these efforts, corporate profitability has deteriorated considerably, with the adjustment process likely to continue in the period ahead. Greater income uncertainty caused by falling employment and the contraction of credit supply are prompting households to scale back consumption and investment spending. As a result, propensity to save may increase further, with a pick-up in domestic demand not expected before 2011. The introduction of new policy instruments by the MNB and direct lending by the Government are helping the banking sector cope with reduced access to funding in the market. However, lending activity is expected to remain subdued, due to uncertainty about the prospects for growth, and banks are likely to seek to reduce risks associated with their loan portfolios. Procyclical fiscal policy has also contributed to the decline in domestic demand. Constraints on deficit financing do not permit the operation of automatic fiscal stabilisers in full. Over the longer term, the actions taken by the Government to maintain fiscal sustainability are expected to contribute to an increase in the economy's potential growth rate and to putting the government's indebtedness on a sustainable path. All these factors may help restore market confidence and reduce the costs of financing for the economy; however, they may deepen the recession over the short term. There has been a considerable improvement recently in sentiment towards Central and Eastern Europe, and the domestic financial markets have shown signs of consolidation; however, global appetite for risk has remained volatile. Although the package of fiscal measures announced by the Government may lead to a further improvement in sentiment towards Hungarian assets over the longer term, this has not yet been reflected in higher demand for domestic financial assets. The Monetary Council took its decision to maintain interest rates after considering the outlook for the real economy and inflation as well as the latest financial market developments. The base rate may be reduced further in the coming months, if the recent improvement in sentiment continues, and if policy easing does not jeopardise the stability of the financial intermediary system and does not threaten to disrupt capital flows."
Israel,2009-05-25,"25.5.2009</td> The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate unchanged for June 2009 The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for June 2009 will remain unchanged at 0.5 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 1 percent in April, in line with the forecasters' expectations. Since the beginning of 2009 the CPI has risen by 0.9 percent, and over the last twelve months by 3.1 percent, slightly above the upper limit of the target range. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The averages of forecasters' predictions regarding the CPI are for an increase of 0.3 percent in May and 0.4 percent in June. According to these forecasts, inflation over the previous twelve months will return to within the target range as early as next month, and will remain within the range during the next twelve months. Since the publication of the March CPI, the increase in taxes on cigarettes and fuel, and expectations of an increase in VAT, inflation expectationsfor twelve months forward have risen. Those derived from the capital market in May rose to 1.9 percent, and forecasters' expectations in the lastfew days averaged 2.2 percent. Interest rate expectations derived from the capital market are that the rate will not change for June, and thatthe rate a year hence will be 2.2 percent. On average, forecasters expect the interest rate for June to remain unchanged, and to be 1.3 percent in one year. Real economic activity: According to National Accounts figures for the first quarter of 2009. GDP fell at an annual rate of 3.6 percent. This is consistent with the Bank of Israel's forecast that GDP will decline by 1.5 percent in 2009; according to this forecast, growth is expected to return towards the end of the year. Imports plunged by 61.9 percent in the first quarter, and exports by 48.5 percent. Nonresidential investment also dropped sharply, by 37.6 percent, and private consumption fell by 4.3 percent (all these National Accounts figures show the change from the last quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009 in annual terms). The composite state-of-the-economy index for April showed a reduction of 0.3 percent, a relatively moderate decline compared with those in the last few months. The labor market and wages: The crisis is affecting the labor market, although some indicators suggest some easing in the severity of the situation. National Insurance Institute data show that the decline in the number of employee posts in the economy halted in February. The number of unemployed persons continued to increase, but the rate of increase slowed from 2.4 percent in January to 1.8 percent in March, and the rate of unemployment in February stayed at the same level as in January, 6.9 percent On the other hand, unemployment benefit payments in February and March were 59 percent higher than those in February and March 2008, and the rate of increase is accelerating. Health Tax revenues show a real decline of 3.5 percent in April compared with April 2008, probably indicating a more severe fall in wages and employment. The nominal wage per employee post dropped by 0.5 percent in February, and the real wage by 0.7 percent, compared with their January levels. Budget data: In the first four months of 2009 the budget deficit (excluding credit) was NIS 7.9 billion, compared with a surplus of NIS 5.6 billion in the first four months of 2008. Government expenditure since the beginning of the year was about 10 percent (NIS 7.8 billion) lower than thelevel consistent with the new 2009 budget (NIS 246 billion). This was the result of the legal restriction on government spending prior to the approval of the 2009 budget. Expenditure is expected to increase significantly with Knesset approval of the budget. Tax revenues continue to fall, but the rate of decline moderated for the second consecutive month, particularly indirect tax revenues. The budget approved by the government is based on deficit targets of 6 percent of GDP in 2009, and 5.5 percent in 2010. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the monetary policy discussions of 26 April and the current discussions on 24 May, the shekel strengthened against the dollar by 6.8 percent, and against the euro by 1.9 percent. In terms of the index of the effective exchange rate vis-?-vis the currencies of Israel's trading partners (weighted by the volume of trade), the shekel strengthened by 0.6 percent. Over this period, the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar was consistent with the global trend of the weakening of the dollar. The capital and money markets: Between the interest rate discussions of 26 April and 24 May the Tel Aviv 25 share price index rose by 11.6 percent and the Tel Aviv 100 index by 14.5 percent. In this period stock markets around the world generally recorded sharp increases. Yields on unindexed 10-year Israeli government bonds increased by about 60 basis points to 5.47 percent, and yields on US government 10-year bonds increased by about 30 basis points to 3.3 percent, so that over the period as a whole the yieldgap between the Israeli bonds and US government bonds widened to 220 basispoints. Yields on Israeli corporate bonds fell. The Tel-Bond 20 index increased by 0.6 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 3.8 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, declined further this month, from 1.8 percent to 1.4 percent. The CDS spreads of other countries also narrowed. In the last twelve months the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) has grown by 59 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits up to one year) by 19 percent. The rapid increase in M 1 was partly due to the public's switching from deposits to current accounts in light of the low level of interest on the deposits that are included in M 2. The world economy: It seems that the global crisis has entered a new phase. Concern over possible systemic collapse has eased. In the last few weeks more and more indications point to improvements in the global financial markets and the beginnings of the stabilization of economic activity.Much of the recently published economic data is not as bad as expected, and some data are in fact positive. Financial conditions are improving with the reduction in uncertainty regarding the banking sector. The economic environment remains weak, however, and the basic data still indicate that the economy is in a recession. Against the background of the persistent slowdownin world demand, and despite some rise in inflation expectations, inflation and inflation expectations are still well contained. Many central banks are continuing to implement expansionary monetary policies, and those that have not yet reached zero interest rates are making further cuts in their rates. As the interest rate in some countries is close to zero, central banksare continuing to examine alternatives to interest rate policy, and are focusing on various methods of quantitative easing and dealing with specific credit markets that have encountered difficulties. At the same time, many governments are persisting with expansionary fiscal policies in their attempts to support their economies. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate unchanged for June at its current low level, together with the exceptional measures the Bank is taking--purchases in the foreign currency market and the government bond market--will help strengthen the economy's ability to cope with the effects of the global economic crisis. The decision will support the achievement of the inflation target, real economic activity, and the stability of the financial system. The main considerations behindthe decision are: Inflation expectations in Israel for the next twelve months, both those of the forecasters and those derived from the capital market, are around the midpoint of the target range. Data from the financial side, and recently also from the real side, indicate that the negative trend in economic activity may be moderating. That said, renewed growth is expected only towards the end of the year. At this stage the low interest rate together with the other tools that the Bank of Israel is operating are helping the economy return to positive growth. Central banks around the world are keeping their interest rates low, and are focusing on additional monetary tools that they have activated; those that have not yet reached very low levels of interest are continuing to reduce their rates. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments, and will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives--price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decisionwill be published on 8 June 2009. The decision regarding the interest rate for July 2009 will be publishedat 17:30 on 22 June 2009. 25.5.2009</td> The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate unchanged for June 2009.

Malaysia,2009-05-26,"At the Monetary Policy Committee meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 2.00 percent. The deterioration in the world economy during the first quarter was worse than expected as the global financial turmoil became more prolonged. While certain segments of the international financial markets have stabilised, and further progress has been achieved in the financial sector resolution, the spillover effects have led to a severe contraction in economic activity in the advanced economies.The full effect of these global developments is being felt by the regional economies during the first half of 2009. The domestic economy continues to be adversely affected by the significant contraction in external demand, resulting in steep declines in exports and industrial production. This has resulted in a marked contraction in the Malaysian economy in the first quarter of 2009. These conditions have continued into the second quarter. However, a more modest pace of decline in the latest indicators of global economic activity suggest the potential for a gradual improvement in the second half of the year. This stabilisation in the external environment is also supported by the accelerated implementation of fiscal measures, the further moderation in inflation and continued access to financing, thereby increasing the prospects for a resumption of growth in the Malaysian economy. The current assessment is that the accumulated monetary policy initiatives and measures to enhance access to financing are sufficient to provide support to domestic demand. With sizeable and sufficient liquidity in the system, continued emphasis will be given to ensure an adequate flow of credit to all segments of the economy. Bank Negara Malaysia 26 May 2009."
Philippines,2009-05-27,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to reduce the BSP's key policy interest rates by another 25 basis points to 4.25 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.25 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility, effective immediately. This is the fifth rate cut since December 2008, and represents a cumulative reduction of 175 basis points in the BSP's key policy rates. This RRP rate is the lowest since 15 May 1992. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also reduced accordingly. The Monetary Board decided to further cut policy rates based on the latest baseline forecasts which indicated that average inflation is expected to remain within the target ranges in 2009 and 2010. In addition, the Monetary Board considered that, on balance, the downside risks to the inflation outlook continue to dominate as the decline in domestic and global demand has dampened inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations also remain well anchored. Meanwhile, the rebound in global oil prices and volatility in the foreign exchange market are possible sources of upside risk to future inflation. The Board observed that while there are encouraging signs that the global slowdown may be bottoming out, it is too early to conclude that global economic conditions are clearly moving towards normalcy. There are still large imbalances in the global financial markets which could prolong the adjustment process. The Board also noted the lower-than-expected GDP growth of 0.4 percent for the first quarter of 2009. In this connection, the decision to lower policy rates could provide additional boost to spending and investment in the economy and support market confidence. The BSP is prepared to move quickly to address potential risks to price stability while continuing to support domestic activity consistent with a non-inflationary path."
Poland,2009-05-27,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 27 May 2009 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 26-27 May 2009 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate at 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 4.00% on an annual basis. Data released since the last meeting of the Council point to a continuation of the recession in the United States and its deepening in the euro area. At the same time, some information on the United States may be signalling a certain revival of activity in this economy in the time to come, while  despite improvement in some economic climate indicators  the forecasts of economic growth in the euro area, which is Poland's main trading partner, were lowered again. Further deterioration of the economic climate is also observed in Central and Eastern European countries. The latest information on the Polish economy confirms that economic activity has been continuing at a low level. Slowing growth is driven by the decline in demand connected with recession abroad, lowering of growth in households' real wages and worse financial standing of enterprises as well as limited credit availability. Despite persisting excess liquidity of the banking sector, the cost of credit remains at a relatively high level due to increased risk premium. Deterioration in the sentiment of economic agents is another factor limiting demand. At the same time, information on labour market developments confirms further decline in employment and gradual lowering of wage growth, which is conducive to curbing inflationary pressure. Over the recent period the volatility of exchange rates of Central and Eastern European currencies, including the zloty, has seen some reduction, though it remains relatively high in most of these countries. In April 2009 the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland increased to 4.0%, remaining above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5% and also above the upper limit for deviations from the target, set at 3.5%. High annual growth of administered prices, including the prices of energy and services related to maintenance of dwelling, has been conducive to inflation continuing at an elevated level. The rise of inflation in April primarily resulted from higher food prices and prices in the category transport, which was connected with earlier significant weakening of the zloty exchange rate, and from the rising prices of excise goods. All core inflation indices increased as well. In the Council's assessment, inflation in the coming months will probably decrease, though it will remain at an elevated level, mainly as a result of the relatively high annual growth of food prices and administered prices, including primarily prices of energy. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. In the medium term, the recession in the global economy bringing about the decline in the domestic economic growth will lower the inflationary pressure in Poland. Further deterioration of the situation in the labour market and the ensuing decline in the growth of real wages as well as worse than in the previous period financial standing of enterprises will also be conducive to curbing demand and, consequently, the inflationary pressure. The tightening of banks' lending conditions will have a similar effect. On the other hand, the previously observed considerable depreciation of the zloty exchange rate will drive price increases. The Council assessed the probability of inflation running below the target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running above the target. The Council's decisions in the coming months will take account of the incoming information on the outlook for economic growth and inflation, the situation in the financial markets in Poland and abroad, information on the public finance sector and zloty exchange rate developments. Moreover, the Council decided that a more comprehensive assessment of inflation outlook will be possible after considering the results of the June projection based on the NECMOD model. The Council decided to lower the required reserve rate by 0.5 percentage points from 3.5% to 3%. This decision applies to the required reserve maintained from 30 June 2009. In the Council's assessment, the lowering of the required reserve rate should offer banks more space for credit expansion. The Council will continue to analyse the impact of developments in the domestic interbank market on the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Poland. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts required for euro adoption in Poland. The Council approved the Report on the Operations of the NBP in 2008. At its meeting on 13 May 2009, the Council adopted the Report on Monetary Policy Implementation in 2008 and positively assessed the Management Board of the National Bank of Poland as regards the implementation of the monetary policy guidelines for the year 2008 through open market operations, standing facilities, foreign exchange swaps as well as the calculation and maintenance of banks' required reserves."
South Africa,2009-05-28,"1.1 The global downturn continues to have a negative impact on the domestic economy which experienced two consecutive quarters of contraction. The significant widening of the domestic output gap has added further downside risk to the inflation outlook. The downward trend in inflation is expected to continue, despite inflation being subject to some inertia in the near term. 1.2 Domestic economic developments will be influenced to a large degree by the pace and magnitude of the recovery in the global economy. There are tentative signs that the global economy may have seen the worst of the downturn, but the recovery is expected to be slow and protracted. 2.1 The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas declined from 8,5 per cent in March 2009 to 8,4 per cent in April. The prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages, which increased at a year-on-year rate of 13,7 per cent, contributed 2,1 percentage points to the inflation outcome. Housing and utilities contributed 1,8 percentage points. This category includes electricity and other fuels which increased by 29,4 per cent. Petrol prices declined by 17,5 per cent, while public transport prices increased by 15,1 per cent. 2.2 The producer price index continued its downward trend in April when it increased at a year-on-year rate of 2,9 per cent. Food price pressures moderated further with manufactured food price inflation declining to 8,4 per cent compared with 9,4 per cent in March. Prices of agricultural products increased by 2,2 per cent. 3.1 The most recent CPI inflation forecast of the Bank shows a relatively unchanged outcome for the near-term as compared to that presented to the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. Over the longer term, there appears to be a moderate improvement. This forecast is similar to the Reuters consensus forecast of private analysts who expect inflation to average 6,9 per cent and 5,7 per cent in 2009 and 2010 respectively. 3.2 The main upside risk to the inflation outlook comes from cost-push pressures, in particular from electricity price increases. Eskom has applied to the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) for a 34 per cent interim increase in electricity tariffs, but there is still uncertainty about the final adjustment. A number of municipalities have already budgeted for significant electricity price increases in anticipation of higher Eskom tariffs. 3.3 In line with the less negative global outlook, there has been a moderate recovery in international oil prices. North Sea Brent crude oil has been trading at prices of around US$60 per barrel during the past days, compared with an average of around US$50 per barrel during April. These developments may result in a moderate increase in the domestic petrol price in June. The impact of the higher international prices on domestic petrol prices has been partly offset by exchange rate movements during the month. 3.4 Food price inflation remains well above average inflation, and has been lagging the favourable developments at the producer price level and in the spot prices of agricultural commodities. Food price inflation measured 17,9 per cent in August 2008 and has been moderating persistently, but slowly, since then. 3.5 In the first quarter of 2009. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted at a quarter-on-quarter annualised rate of 6,4 per cent, with mining and quarrying declining by 32,8 per cent. The manufacturing sector, which contracted at an annualised rate of 22,1 per cent, was the largest contributor to the negative GDP outcome. The weak manufacturing performance was also reflected in the utilisation of production capacity in the manufacturing sector which declined from 82 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 79 per cent in the first quarter of 2009. 3.6 The GDP contraction was broad based, with general government services, personal services and construction being the only sectors that exhibited positive growth. Civil construction is expected to remain strong as the infrastructure programme proceeds. However, other parts of construction are expected to remain under pressure as the value of new building plans passed for both residential and non-residential construction declined by 13,4 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the preceding quarter. 3.7 Recent high frequency indicators suggest that the negative trend in GDP growth is likely to continue during the second quarter of 2009, although at a more moderate pace of contraction. Most analysts expect positive but relatively low growth in the final half of this year. The composite leading and coincident business cycle indicators of the Bank indicate continued weakness in the economy in 2009. In March 2009 the leading indicator declined by 15,1 per cent, the largest year-on-year decline on record. The composite indicator declined at a year-on-year rate of 9,4 per cent in February. The Investec Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) declined further to 35,6 index points in April. However, expectations of business conditions six months ahead showed some improvement. 3.8 Domestic demand conditions remain subdued. Real wholesale trade sales declined by 5,9 per cent on a year-on-year basis in March 2009, and by 1,8 per cent on a month-on-month basis. Real retail sales recorded a 5,3 per cent year-on-year decline, and a 1,9 per cent month-on-month decline in March. Total new vehicle sales declined at a year-on-year rate of 44 per cent in April, with commercial vehicle sales declining by 51 per cent. Vehicle exports were 31 per cent lower in April compared with the previous month. 3.9 Household consumption expenditure is expected to remain constrained by negative wealth effects and tight credit conditions. The various house price indices show that house prices have been falling in recent months. Although the all-share index on the JSE Limited has recovered somewhat since its recent lows, it is still significantly lower than the levels prevailing during 2008. Domestic credit extension continues to reflect the lower demand for credit, as well as the wider spreads and more stringent credit criteria being applied by banks with respect to loans to both households and companies. Year-on-year growth in total loans and advances to the private sector declined to 6,6 per cent in April. The rate of growth of instalment sale credit and leasing finance declined by 0,1 per cent, reflecting the weak demand for durable goods. Extension of bank overdrafts contracted by 6,8 per cent, while credit card advances increased marginally. 3.10 There are tentative signs that the downturn in the global economy may be bottoming out as financial market conditions appear to have become less restrictive. However there are as yet few convincing indications that the recovery will be quick. At this stage it appears that a protracted period of slow, below-potential growth is most likely, with most analysts predicting some recovery later this year or early next year. Global inflation pressures remain subdued and have declined in a number of economies. 3.11 Since the beginning of the year the rand has appreciated by around 13 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. While the rand, along with other currencies, remains vulnerable to further possible bouts of risk aversion, the risk to the inflation outlook has been reduced by the relative strength of the rand. 4.1 The evidence which was presented to the Monetary Policy Committee suggests that the output gap has widened further. This is expected to contribute to an improved inflation outlook, notwithstanding some current inflation inertia. Accordingly the MPC has decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 100 basis points to 7,5 per cent per annum with effect from 29 May 2009."
Euroarea,2009-06-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates are appropriate taking into account our decisions of early May, including the enhanced credit support measures, and all the information and analyses which have become available since then. We confirmed our expectation that price developments over the policy-relevant horizon will remain dampened by the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. Recent survey information indicates that, following two quarters of very negative growth, economic activity over the remainder of this year is expected to decline at much less negative rates. After a stabilisation phase, positive quarterly growth rates are expected by mid-2010. This assessment incorporates adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. At the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The outcome of the monetary analysis supports the assessment of moderate inflationary pressure, as money and credit growth have further declined on an annual basis. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Let me now explain our assessment in some more detail, starting with the economic analysis. Reflecting the impact of the financial market turmoil, and in particular a sharp fall in global demand and trade, economic activity weakened considerably in the first quarter of 2009. According to Eurostat's first estimate, economic activity in the euro area contracted by 2.5% quarter on quarter, after a decline of 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2008. This will have a significant negative impact on the average growth rate for 2009. However, more recently, there have been improvements in survey data, albeit at very low levels. In line with such evidence, after the extremely weak first quarter, activity over the remainder of this year is expected to decline at much less negative rates. After a stabilisation phase, positive quarterly growth rates are expected by mid-2010. This assessment is broadly in line with the June 2009 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, according to which annual real GDP growth will range between -5.1% and -4.1% in 2009 and between -1.0% and 0.4% in 2010. Compared with the March 2009 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges have been revised downwards, in particular for 2009. A substantial negative carry-over effect from the previous year and the very weak result for the first quarter of 2009 significantly contributed to this downward revision. The projected gradual recovery next year, with rates of growth returning to positive levels by mid-2010, reflects the effects of the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as of the measures taken so far to restore the functioning of the financial system both inside and outside the euro area. Forecasts by international organisations are broadly in line with the June 2009 Eurosystem staff projections, taking into account the results of the first quarter. In the view of the Governing Council, the risks to the economic outlook are balanced. On the positive side, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus under way and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve more quickly than currently expected. On the other hand, concerns remain relating to the following potential factors: a stronger impact on the real economy from the turmoil in financial markets, more unfavourable developments in labour markets, the intensification of protectionist pressures and, finally, adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation was, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, 0.0% in May, compared with 0.6% in April. As explained on earlier occasions, the further decline in inflation rates was fully anticipated and primarily reflects base effects resulting from the sharp swings in global commodity prices over the past 12 months. Looking ahead, owing to these base effects, annual inflation rates are projected to decline further and temporarily remain negative over the coming months, before returning to positive territory by the end of 2009. Such short-term movements are, however, not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Looking further ahead, price and cost developments are expected to remain dampened in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. This outlook is consistent with the June 2009 Eurosystem staff projections for euro area inflation, in which annual HICP inflation is seen to range between 0.1% and 0.5% in 2009, revised slightly downwards from the March 2009 ECB staff projections. For 2010. Eurosystem staff project annual HICP inflation to range between 0.6% and 1.4%, broadly unchanged from the March 2009 ECB staff projections. Available forecasts from international organisations provide a similar picture. Against this background, it is again important to stress that the indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. On the downside, these risks relate in particular to the outlook for economic activity, while on the upside they relate to higher than expected commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm the continued deceleration in the pace of underlying monetary expansion and thus support the assessment of moderate inflationary pressures. In April, the annual growth rate of M3 declined further to 4.9% and that of loans to the private sector to 2.4%. However, especially with regard to M3 growth, the pace of decline in annual growth rates was slower than in previous months, reflecting a brisk growth in monetary aggregates in April. The latest developments in M3 components continue to reflect to a large extent the impact of past reductions in key ECB interest rates, which have led to declines both in the levels of different deposit interest rates and in the spreads between them. This has implied, for instance, lower opportunity costs for market participants to shift funds into highly liquid overnight deposits and explains the strengthening of annual M1 growth to 8.4% in April. At the same time, the reduced remuneration of other short-term deposits and marketable instruments continues to foster the allocation of funds to instruments outside M3. The outstanding amount of MFI loans to the private sector contracted somewhat further in April. This development is again mainly due to a negative flow of short-term lending to non-financial corporations, which partly reflects a lower need for working capital in view of the sharp deterioration in economic activity and business prospects during the first few months of the year, and greater recourse to liquidity buffers in financing such working capital. By contrast, longer-term lending to non-financial corporations remained positive. The past reductions in key ECB rates have continued to be passed on to lending rates to both non-financial corporations and households. The resulting improvement in financing conditions should provide ongoing support for economic activity in the period ahead. However, given the challenges which lie ahead, banks should take appropriate measures to further strengthen their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of the government measures to support the financial sector, in particular as regards recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates are appropriate taking into account our decisions of early May, including the enhanced credit support measures, and all the information and analyses which have become available since then. We confirmed our expectation that price developments over the policy-relevant horizon will remain dampened by the marked weakening of economic activity in the euro area and globally. Recent survey information indicates that, following two quarters of very negative growth, economic activity over the remainder of this year is expected to decline at much less negative rates. After a stabilisation phase, positive quarterly growth rates are expected by mid-2010. This assessment incorporates adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. At the same time, available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check with the outcome of the monetary analysis supports the assessment of moderate inflationary pressure, as money and credit growth have further declined on an annual basis. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full. Hence, with all the measures taken, monetary policy will provide ongoing support for households and corporations. Once the macroeconomic environment improves, the Governing Council will ensure that the measures taken can be quickly unwound and the liquidity provided absorbed. Hence, any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term can be effectively countered in a timely fashion. As has been emphasised many times, the Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policies, the latest projections by the European Commission point to a sharp increase in the euro area general government deficit and debt ratios in 2009. The deficit ratio is projected to rise to 5.3% of GDP in 2009 and further to 6.5% in 2010, from 1.9% in 2008, with the debt ratio exceeding 80% of GDP in 2010. A large majority of euro area countries are expected to exceed the 3% of GDP deficit reference value in 2009 and 2010. To ensure trust in the sustainability of public finances, an ambitious and credible adjustment effort will be required to return as soon as possible to sound fiscal positions, supported by a full application of the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. The rapid attainment of sound fiscal positions will be necessary to enable countries to deal with the additional fiscal burden owing to demographic ageing as well as the risks arising from government guarantees that were provided to stabilise financial sectors. Turning to structural policies, there is a strong case for undertaking further efforts to support potential growth in the euro area. It is crucial that the focus is now on strengthening the adjustment capacity and flexibility of the euro area economy in line with the principle of an open market economy. In this respect, the current situation can be seen as a catalyst to accelerate the implementation of necessary domestic reforms, notably labour market reforms to facilitate appropriate wage-setting and labour mobility across sectors and regions, as well as product market reforms to foster competition and speed up restructuring and productivity growth. At the same time, many of the policy measures taken in recent months with a view to supporting specific segments of the economy need to be phased out in a timely manner."
South Korea,2009-06-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. The domestic economic downturn has flattened out thanks to the proactive fiscal and monetary policy strive. The slump in domestic demand has moderated and production activities have improved. The downside risk to economic growth is thought, however, to persist because of the rise in international raw material prices and the economic slowdown in the major advanced economies. Consumer price inflation has been decelerating thanks to the easing of demand-pull pressures owing to the economic downturn coupled with the downwardly stable exchange rate. The mild upward trend of real estate prices has continued. Financial market price variables such as the exchange rate and stock prices have shown a stable pattern of movements. Lending to the household sector and SMEs has expanded steadily, but concerns about credit risk and the shortermism of market funds have not been resolved. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain accommodative policy stance for the time being and do what is needed to bring about the continuation of the recent improving pattern of economic and financial movements."
Peru,2009-06-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2009 BCRP REDUCED REFERENCE INTEREST RATE TO 3.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to reduce the monetary policy reference interest rate for the fifth consecutive month, from 4.0 to 3.0 percent, as a result of which this rates accumulates a reduction of 350 basis points so far this year. This decision is based on the sustained reductions observed in the rate of inflation as a result of which this rate has declined from 6.7 percent in December to 4.2 percent in May and in inflation expectations, as well as on the slowdown observed in economic activity. Inflation in May showed a rate of -0.04 percent, as a result of which accumulated inflation in the last 12 months declined for the sixth consecutive month. Inflation and inflation expectations are expected to continue declining in the next months, thus allowing inflation's convergence to the target range in the third quarter of this year. Should this trend persist, the Bank will continue loosening its monetary policy stance The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 3.80 percent. Overnight deposits: 2.20 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the next month on its session of July 9, 2009."
Chile,2009-06-16,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 16 June 2009 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to reduce the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 0.75% (annual). Internationally, recent data show that global growth prospects for this year have stabilized. Stock markets have picked up, credit premiums have decreased and commodity prices, particularly prices of copper and oil, have risen. Domestically, available information on output for the second quarter of this year continues to post negative y-o-y variation rates. Unemployment has increased. Tight lending conditions persist, although they are reflecting the impact of the increased monetary stimulus. In May, the set of inflation indicators showed reduced core inflationary pressures. Wage dynamics continue to be in line with historical patterns. Low annual inflation rates are foreseen for the coming quarters, while medium-term inflation expectations remain stable. The Board considers that, in the most likely scenario, it will be necessary to maintain the monetary stimulus for a longer period than the one implicit in financial asset prices. This permits projected inflation to stand at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Turkiye,2009-06-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 9.25 percent to 8.75 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 11.75 percent to 11.25 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. is decreased from 5.25 percent to 4.75 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 14.75 percent to 14.25 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 10.75 percent to 10.25 percent. Recent data releases signal a partial recovery in domestic economic activity. However, resolving the problems in the global economy is likely to take a considerable period of time. External demand remains weak while domestic investment demand continues to contract. These developments suggest that the recovery in economic activity would be slow and gradual, and labor market conditions are not expected to improve anytime soon. Therefore, inflation is expected to remain at low levels in the foreseeable future. It should also be noted that inflation could rise temporarily in June due to tax hikes and base effects. The tightness in financial conditions still persists to some extent, and uncertainties regarding the impact of the problems in financial markets on the real economy persist, suggesting that downside risks still remain. Therefore, the Committee envisages that the next rate cut may be measured, and that it seems necessary for the monetary policy to maintain an easing bias for a considerable period. The Committee will consider a deceleration in the pace of rate cuts or a pause should the signs of improvement in economic activity turn into a robust recovery. The Committee has also assessed current demand conditions and projections of the Turkish lira liquidity. To facilitate the liquidity management of banks and to enhance the transmission of monetary policy, the Committee has approved the use of repos up to three- month maturity, in addition to the main funding instrument of one-week repos, when needed. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Egypt,2009-06-18,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release June 18, 2009 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to cut its overnight deposit rate by 50 bps to 9 percent per annu. The discount rate was also cut by 50 bps to 9 percent per annu. In its meeting held on June 18, 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut its overnight deposit rate by 50 bps to 9 percent and the overnight lending rate by 50 bps to 105 percen. Annual headline CPI inflation continued to decline in May 2009, reaching 102 percent down from 117 percent in Apri. This records a cumulative drop of 134 percentage points since its peak in August 200. The downward trend in headline inflation comes on the back of the decline in domestic food inflation, which fell from 31 percent (y/y) in August 2008 to 125 percent (y/y) in May 200. In the meantime, the global financial crisis continues to interrupt the domestic growth momentum, bringing domestic GDP growth in 2008/09 Q3 to 43 percent compared to 71 in 2007/0. Moreover despite tentative signs that the worst of the global downturn may be over, consensual projections point to a slow and gradual global economic recovery in 201. Against this background, the MPC's assessment of the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and growth outlook over the medium-term remains unchanged as risks to the domestic growth outlook continue to be on the downside while inflationary pressures are subsidin. The MPC will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global economic turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objectiv.

Hungary,2009-06-22,"At its meeting on 22 June 2009, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to maintain the central bank base rate at 9.50%. The Monetary Council continues to judge that the Hungarian economy is undergoing a severe downturn this year. Inflation is likely to rise sharply over the short term due to the indirect tax increases; however, it may be close to target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy. Data released over the past month show that value added fell across all goods producing sectors in 2009 Q1. The weakness of industries producing for the domestic market also played a role in the decline in output, in addition to the deterioration in the performance of the export sector. Households have cut back their spending recently, in response to the further tightening in credit conditions and the adjustment in wages and employment in the labour market, which, in turn, has contributed to a reduction in the country's external financing requirement. Nevertheless, the Hungarian economy continues to face difficult external demand conditions. Although business confidence indices in the country's export markets show some signs of improvement, economic activity in Europe is unlikely to recover rapidly. Given this outlook, the Hungarian economy is only expected to recover convincingly in 2011. Over the past two months, inflation has remained above the 3% inflation target, mainly reflecting one-off factors, and it is expected to increase substantially further from the second half of the year, due to the change in indirect taxes. The weaker exchange rate compared with the average of previous years has not yet passed through fully into domestic prices; however, the decline in demand may mitigate the possible future effects of depreciation. Overall, inflation may settle below the target over the horizon relevant for monetary policy, due to the prolonged weakness of domestic demand. The increase in investors' appetite for risk around the world and the improvement in sentiment towards the economies of Central and Eastern Europe in the spring have been largely sustained over the past month. However. Hungary's dependence on foreign funding and the ongoing strains in domestic financial markets call for caution in the conduct of monetary policy. The Monetary Council took its decision to leave interest rates unchanged after considering the outlook for the real economy and inflation as well as the latest financial market developments. The central bank base rate may be reduced, if the recent improvement in risk sentiment is sustained. However, the release schedule for the minutes of the Monetary Council's rate-setting meetings will change from August 2009. From that date the minutes will be published two working days earlier, on the third working day of the week. The modified publication dates for 2009 Q2 can be downloaded from the Council's meeting calendar."
Israel,2009-06-22,"22.6.2009</td> The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate unchanged for July 2009 The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for July 2009 willremain unchanged at 0.5 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.4 percent in May, in line with the forecasters' expectations. Since the beginning of 2009 the CPI has risen by 1.2 percent. For the first time since December 2007, the inflation rate (measured over the previous twelve months) of 2.8 percent was within the target range. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The averages of forecasters' predictions regarding the CPI are for an increase of 0.4 percent in Juneand 0.6 percent in July. Following one-off price increases expected in thenext two months, resulting in part from changes in tax rates and in government-supervised prices, including water prices, inflation is expected to beclose to the upper limit of the inflation target range, but to decline thereafter. Twelve-month-forward inflation expectations calculated from the capital markets remained unchanged in June at their May level, 1.9 percent, close to the midpoint of the target range. Forecasters' expectations, in contrast, increased from their level of 1.9 percent in May to 2.3 percent in June. Forecasters also upped their forecasts of the Bank of Israel interest rate in mid-2010 from 1.3 percent in May to 2 percent in June, on average. The interest rate twelve months forward derived from the capital markets stood at 2.5 percent. The interest rate for July according to the average of the forecasters' predictions and that derived form the capital markets is not expected to change. Real economic activity: Some of the data that became available during the last month support the assessment that the continued decline in real activity evident in the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 has moderated. Initial indications from the Companies Survey for the second quarter of 2009 point to a more moderate fall in activity: the net balance of total activity in the business sector showed a modest decline, following two quarters of steep drops. Indicators of private consumption suggestthat it stabilized in the second quarter, after falling at an annual rate of about 3.5 percent in the previous two quarters. In foreign trade too there are signs of a smaller decline in imports and exports in the last two months. In the last two months the Purchasing Managers Index rose. The rate of the reduction in tax revenues eased in May, having done so also in March and April. Nonetheless, the composite state-of-the-economy index shows further decline in the level of activity: in May it fell by 0.5 percent, following its 0.7 percent drop in April and even sharper falls in the previous months. The labor market and wages: The rate of unemployment increased for the third quarter in succession, and reached 7.6 percent in the first quarter of 2009. Unemployment trend data of the Central Bureau of Statistics gave a figure of 7.8 percent for April, and the rate is expected to continuerising in the coming quarters. The real wage and the nominal wage both increased by about 3 percent in 2009:Q 1 from the level in the previous quarter (annual rate, seasonally adjusted), after three quarters in which the realwage fell. Health Tax revenues in April and May were 0.5 percent lower than in April and May 2008, and 5.2 percent lower than in February and March 2009 (annual rates, seasonally adjusted), indicating a continued fall in wages and employment. Budget data: In the first five months of 2009 the budget deficit (excluding credit) was NIS 10.5 billion, compared with a surplus of NIS 6 billion in the first five months of 2008. The large deficit reflects the steep drop in tax revenues. In May the government continued to act without theKnesset having approved the budget. Total government expenditure in the first five months of the year was lower than the level permitted in the absence of an approved budget (monthly expenditure of one-twelfth of the previous year's budget), and was NIS 7.8 billion less than that consistent with the full implementation of the expenditure in the 2009 budget proposal. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the monetary policy discussions of 24 May and the current discussions on 21 June, the exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar against the euro showed very little change, with 0.05 percent shekel appreciation against the dollar and 0.1 percent against the euro. In terms of the index of the effective exchange rate vis-?-vis the currencies of Israel's trading partners (weighted by the volume of trade), the shekel strengthened by 0.2 percent. Over this period, the shekel strengthened against the dollar more moderately than did other currencies. That said, the shekel exchange rate against the dollar and the euro was highly volatile. The capital and money markets: Between the interest rate discussions of 24 May and 21 June the Tel Aviv 25 share price index fell by 0.6 percent while the Tel Aviv 100 index rose 1.3 percent. The downward trend of the Tel Aviv 25 index was in contrast to that in most leading share price indices around the world. Yields on unindexed 10-year Israeli government bonds edged up by 5 basis points to 5.52 percent, and yields on US government 10-year bonds increased by about 34 basis points to 3.78 percent, so that over the period as a whole the yield gap between Israeli government bonds andUS government bonds narrowed to about 175 basis points. Yields on Israeli corporate bonds fell. The Tel-Bond 20 index increased by 3.3 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 6 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, increased this month, from 1.4 percent to 1.7 percent, reversing the trend of the previous few months. The CDS spreads of other countries also widened. The money supply: In the last twelve months the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) has grown by 54 percent,and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits up to one year) by 18 percent. The steep increase in M 1 was due mainly to the public's switching from time deposits to current accounts in light of the low level of interest on the deposits that are included in M 2. The world economy: There are increasing signs that the global recession is approaching its turning point. The rate of decline has eased, andsome indicators point to an improvement. The level of demand, however, is still very low, as is world trade, and there is uncertainty regarding the strength and timing of the recovery. The IMF revised its forecast of global growth in 2010 upwards from 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent, and left the forecast for 2009 at minus 1.3 percent. In the financial markets the increase in long-term bond yields was notable, a trend that was led by the US and that affected most other markets. The main reason for this was the expected increase in government bond issues to finance large budget deficits, principally in the US, but also in other countries. At the same time, the demand for government bonds has fallen because of the recovery of the financial systemand increased risk tolerance on the part of investors. It seems that investors are again looking for higher yields in riskier assets, a trend that isreflected by narrowing spreads, rising indices in emerging markets, and rising share price indices and risk assets. Oil and commodity prices have increased steeply since the beginning of the year. The general view is that the resulting inflationary pressures will be offset by the wide global outputgap, and that the inflation environment will remain low in 2009 and 2010. Most central banks are continuing to operate expansionary monetary policies. In countries that have not yet reached zero interest rates, further cuts in their rates are being made, and others are pursuing quantitative easing. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate unchanged for July at its current low level, together with the complementary measures the Bank is taking--purchases in the foreign currency market and the government bond market--will help strengthen the economy's ability to cope with the effects of the global economic crisis. The decision will support the achievement of the inflation target, real economic activity, and the stability of the financial system. The main considerations behindthe decision are: Inflation is within the inflation target range, and forecasters' predictions as well as forecasts derived from the capital markets are that it is likely to remain within the target range in the coming year. It should be noted that changes in tax rates and in government-supervised prices in the next two months are expected to have a one-off effect on the level of prices, and thus to increase inflation (measured over the previous twelve months) to close to the upper limit of the target range. Thereafter, according to the forecasts, inflation will move closer to the midpoint of the range. Data on real activity in Israel strengthen the assessment that the reduction in GDP isstarting to moderate. That said, real activity is expected to contract further in the next few months, with further increases in the unemployment rate. The continued expansionary monetary policy supports the return of the economy to positive growth. Central banks around the world are keeping their interest rates low, and continue to operate the additional monetary tools that they have activated; those that have not yet reached very low levels of interest are continuing to reduce their rates. Expectations are for inflation in the near future to remain within the target range, even if for some time it is likely to be close to the upper limit of the range. Economic activity is expected to remain subdued in the near future. This situation provides support for keeping the interest rate atits low level in the next few months. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments, and will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives--price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decisionwill be published on 6 July 2009. The decision regarding the interest rate for August 2009 will be published at 17:30 on 27 July 2009. 22.6.2009</td> The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate unchanged for July 2009.

Georgia,2009-06-24,"24.06.2009: The NBG Keeps its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) unchanged at 6 Percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on June 24, 2009 and decided to keep its main policy rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 6 percent. The annual rate of inflation was 2.2 percent in May and the average annual inflation stands at 6.1 percent. The forecasted inflation has increased since the Committee's last meeting, although overall inflation is expected to remain at a low level throughout the year. According to the existing estimates, gross domestic product decreased by more than expected during the first quarter of the current year. The volume of foreign direct investment has also decreased as well as the level of transfers from abroad, factors which for years were the main driving force of economic growth. Despite this, there are clear signs that like in other parts of the globe, the nation's slump in economic activity is showing signs of bottoming out. In particular, the local real estate market prices have stabilized over the last couple of weeks. In addition, global market prices of several commodities especially those of metals have increased, which should aid in the restoration of Georgia's export revenues. Monetary aggregates have stabilized and banking sector deposits have increased as well. Over the last month, the National Bank' interventions on the foreign exchange market have been limited to the use of foreign exchange auctions and the official exchange rate is determined on the interbank market on the basis of the deals concluded on that venue. The National Bank's interventions are minimal in the functioning of the foreign exchange market. The abovementioned changes have aided the development of the interbank foreign exchange market, where the turnover (volume) has increased considerably over the last period. The development of the foreign exchange market will in turn increase the stability and efficiency of the market. At the same time, the foreign exchange swap mechanism has also been implemented successfully which should increase the availability of loans to individuals and legal entities in domestic currency and decrease dollarization. The NBG will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on July 22, 2009."
Poland,2009-06-24,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 24 June 2009 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 23-24 June 2009 The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points: (cid:131) reference rate to 3.50 % on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate to 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate to 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate to 3.75% on an annual basis. In 2009 Q1 GDP declined in majority of EU countries and other developed economies, which indicates recession in the global economy. However, recently there were signs pointing to the possibility that recession may be gradually fading out. Also the situation in the global financial markets improved slightly. Despite less pessimistic sentiment of economic agents, economic growth forecasts for the majority of Central and Eastern European countries were further revised downwards. The growth of prices in the major economies decelerated considerably which was due to the significant slowdown in world economic growth and concurrent drop in commodity prices. Yet, recently commodity prices in the world markets have increased again. Recession in the global economy contributes to significant weakening of economic activity in Poland. In 2009 Q1 GDP growth decreased to 0.8% y/y i.e. showing a slightly stronger decline than anticipated in the February NBP projection. 2009 Q1 saw a rise in consumption and a slight growth in investment coupled with a strong decrease in inventories. Exports plunged considerably, yet, due to the zloty exchange rate depreciation and the resulting improvement in the competitiveness of Polish products, as well as declining domestic demand, the reduction in imports was larger, which resulted in positive contribution of net exports to GDP growth. In 2009 Q2 economic activity in Poland remained subdued which is reflected in a decline in industrial output and a drop in growth of construction and assembly production. At the same time, some economic indicators were better than expected. The sentiment of enterprises and households also improved slightly, yet, it continues to be low. Further deterioration was seen in the labour market i.e. employment in the corporate sector was falling and unemployment (after seasonal adjustments) was rising which was accompanied by considerable decline in the growth of nominal and real wages. Reduced lending, in particular to the corporate sector, constituted an additional factor conducive to curbing economic growth. Following a rise observed in the first months of 2009. CPI inflation declined in May 2009 to 3.6%, remaining, however, above the NBP inflation target of 2.5% and the upper limit for deviations from the NBP inflation target, set at 3.5%. Decline in inflation was driven by a drop in annual growth of food prices and administered prices whose increase in the preceding period drove CPI inflation to the currently elevated level. The growth of prices of some goods and services connected with the depreciation of the zloty exchange rate is also conducive to inflation continuing at elevated level; yet, the scale of this growth in May was smaller than in the preceding months. Increased inflation ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, results also from the persistence of inflationary processes which is reflected i.a. in the relatively high core inflation. The Council got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute of the NBP, being one of the inputs into the Council's decision-making on the NBP interest rates. In line with the June projection  under assumption of constant interest rates  there is a 50- percent probability of inflation lying within the range of 2.83.5% in 2009 (as compared to 2.5 3.9% in the February projection), 1.13.2% in 2010 (as compared to 0.53.2%) and 0.83.4% in 2011 (as compared to -0.9-2.6%). In line with the June projection, there is a 50-percent probability of the annual GDP growth lying within the range of -0.41.1% in 2009 (as compared to 0.31.9% in the February projection), 0.22.5% in 2010 (as compared to 1.23.3%) and 2.44.5% in 2011 (as compared to 2.5-4.8%). In the Council's assessment, inflation in the coming months will probably decrease, though it will remain at an elevated level, mainly as a result of the relatively high annual growth of food prices and administered prices, including primarily prices of energy. The recently observed rise in crude oil prices may be conducive to rising inflation. Yet, in the medium term further decline in demand pressure should reduce inflation. The Council assessed the probability of inflation running below the inflation target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running above the target and decided to lower the interest rates. In the Council's assessment, the already implemented cuts in the NBP interest rates together with the lowering of the required reserve rate will support return of the economy to the potential growth path. The Council's decisions in the coming months will take account of the incoming information on the outlook for economic growth and inflation, the situation in the financial markets in Poland and abroad, information on the public finance sector and zloty exchange rate developments. The Council will continue to analyse the impact of developments in the domestic interbank market on the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Poland. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts required for euro adoption in Poland. The Council adopted Inflation Report  June 2009 which will be published on 26 June 2009."
South Africa,2009-06-25,"1.1 The domestic economy continues to show signs of stress in the wake of the global economic downturn. Output growth remains negative while trends in household consumption expenditure have continued to deteriorate. There are however signs that the downturn, both globally and domestically, may be nearing the lower turning point, but the recovery is expected to be slow and protracted. 1.2 The inflation rate has continued its downward trend which has been constrained by relatively sticky services price inflation. While the widening output gap and weak domestic demand pose a downside risk to the inflation outlook, these risks are being increasingly offset by various cost-push and exogenous factors that are impacting on the economy, as well as by deteriorating inflation expectations. 2.1 The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas declined from 8,4 per cent in April 2009 to 8,0 per cent in May. Food price inflation declined from 13,6 per cent in April to 12,1 per cent in May but remains the main contributor to the inflation outcome, having contributed 1,9 percentage points. Housing and utilities inflation contributed 1,8 percentage points, mainly as a result of the 29,6 per cent increase in electricity prices and the 15,1 per cent increase in the cost of maintenance and repairs. Services price inflation has remained unchanged at 8,4 per cent since March 2009, while goods price inflation declined from 8,7 per cent to 7,6 per cent over the same period. 2.2 Producer prices declined at a year-on-year rate of 3 per cent in May 2009. Nonetheless agricultural product prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 1,5 per cent, while manufactured food product prices increased by 6,2 per cent. 3.1 The most recent CPI inflation forecast by the staff of the South African Reserve Bank shows that CPI inflation is still expected to continue its moderate downward trend and to enter the target range during the second quarter of 2010, and to remain within the target range for the rest of the forecast period ending 2011. A more favourable exchange rate assumption has been offset by higher expected petrol price increases and higher-than-expected inflation outcomes. 3.2 CPI inflation expectations, as measured by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at Stellenbosch University deteriorated during the second quarter of 2009. Average inflation expectations for 2009 increased from 8,3 per cent in the first quarter to 8,7 per cent in the second quarter, mainly as a result of upward revisions by financial analysts. While a downward trend for the subsequent two years remains, only the financial analysts predict inflation to be within the inflation target range in the coming two years. Overall. CPI inflation is expected to average 8,1 per cent and 7,9 per cent in 2010 and 2011 respectively. 3.3 Inflation expectations, as measured by the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds also showed a moderate increase over the past weeks. However the break-even rate has generally remained within the inflation target range over the short- to medium-term maturities. 3.4 The growth prospects for the economy remain a downside risk to the inflation outlook. The output gap, which is the difference between actual and potential output growth, has widened over the past few quarters. Following the 6,4 per cent contraction of GDP in the first quarter of 2009, the most recent high frequency data and indicators suggest that the negative trend in GDP growth is likely to have continued during the second quarter of 2009. Mining production declined at a year-on-year rate of 10,6 per cent in April, but increased by 7,2 per cent on a month-on-month basis. Total manufacturing production declined by 3,3 per cent in April 2009, compared to the previous month, and by 21,6 per cent on a year-on-year basis. 3.5 The composite leading indicator as compiled by the staff of the South African Reserve Bank increased slightly in April. The indicator suggests that the lower turning point in the cycle could be reached later in the year. The Kagiso Securities/BER Purchasing Managers' Index remains at low levels but recorded a slight increase in May, also indicating an expectation that the economy may be approaching its lower turning point. This is consistent with the RMB/BER Business Confidence Indicator, which declined further in the second quarter, but the rate of decline has slowed. 3.6 The domestic growth prospects will be determined to an important degree by international developments. The global downturn has resulted in a significant decline in South Africa's exports in the first quarter of 2009, leading to a wider deficit on the current account of the balance of payments compared with the previous quarter. The outlook for the global economy remains uncertain, but there is a general sense of cautious optimism that the lower turning point of the cycle might have been reached. The general view appears to be that the global economy will remain under pressure for most of this year before beginning a slow recovery. 3.7 Growth in domestic expenditure has remained subdued, with real domestic final demand contracting by 1,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2009. Real final consumption expenditure by households declined at a quarter-on-quarter annualised rate of 4,9 per cent. Contractions in consumption were experienced for all broad categories of goods, but there was a rebound in the growth of expenditure on services. Growth in real gross fixed capital formation moderated to 2,6 per cent during the same period. The main contributor to the 2,2 per cent increase in gross domestic expenditure was final consumption expenditure by general government which increased by 5,9 per cent. 3.8 Household consumption expenditure appears to have remained under pressure in the second quarter of 2009. In April, real retail trade sales declined by 1,1 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 6,7 per cent on a year-on-year basis. Real wholesale trade sales increased by 0,7 per cent on a month-on-month basis but declined by 15,1 per cent on a year-on-year basis. While new vehicle sales in May increased marginally compared with the previous month, the year-on-year decline measured 32,9 per cent. 3.9 Household consumption expenditure is expected to remain constrained by tighter credit criteria of banks and negative wealth effects. The various house price indicators all show that house prices have continued to decline. The all-share index on the JSE Limited has recovered somewhat from its lows in March, but is still substantially below the levels recorded during the first half of 2008. 3.10 Growth in expenditure may also be affected negatively by the adverse trends in employment growth. According to the Quarterly Employment Survey of Statistics South Africa, 179,000 jobs were lost in the formal non-agricultural sector during the first quarter of 2009. 3.11 The exchange rate of the rand has fluctuated against the US dollar between a range of about R7,85 and R8,25 since the previous meeting of the MPC. As global risk aversion has declined, a number of emerging market economy currencies have appreciated and since the beginning of the year, the rand has appreciated by approximately 15 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. 3.12 As noted above, food price inflation remains the main contributor to the inflation outcome, but the downward trend has continued, although at a slow pace. The spot price of yellow maize has declined by about 40 per cent since June 2008, and is now at levels last seen in the final quarter of 2006. 3.13 The main upside risk to the inflation outlook comes from cost-push pressures, in particular from electricity price increases and other administered prices, as well as nominal wage increases which have generally been in excess of inflation. In the first quarter of 2009, the increase in unit labour cost over four quarters amounted to 11,2 per cent. 3.14 The international oil price has re-emerged as a potential upside risk to the inflation outlook. The price of North Sea Brent crude oil reached levels in excess of US$70 per barrel in the past week, before declining to current levels of around US$67 per barrel. As a result of the higher international product prices, a further petrol price increase is likely in July. 4.1 The Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7,5 per cent per annum. This decision is based on the economic and inflation analysis provided above. The Committee is fully cognisant of the fact that there has been significant monetary accommodation since December 2008. The MPC remains fully committed to its mandate of achieving and maintaining price stability."
Romania,2009-06-30,"In its meeting of June 30, 2009, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR will closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so that, by using its available instruments, to ensure the fulfillment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. The analysis of the latest statistical data shows the continuation of the disinflation process, with the annual inflation rate falling to 5.95 percent in May 2009 from 6.45 percent in April, amid a slowdown of the growth in administered and volatile prices. The adjusted CORE2 inflation - calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuels) as well as the effects of vice tax - also dropped to an annual rate of 5.04 percent in May from 5.51 percent the previous month, reflecting the reduction of aggregate demand. The faster-than-expected adjustment of the external deficit is correlated with the steeper decline of domestic economic activity amid the effects of the global economic and financial crisis. In the monetary area, it is worth noting the significant slowdown of the credit to the private sector, especially as regards lending to firms, with the annual dynamics reaching a seven-year low both at aggregate level and broken down by components. The average interbank money market rate has approached the monetary policy rate. The average rates on banks' new term deposits as well as their lending rates on new loans have seen significant downward adjustments, albeit remaining distorted in relation to the monetary policy rate. Meanwhile, the leu exchange rate volatility has considerably subsided amid a progressive improvement in financial investors' global risk appetite and a visibly narrower current account deficit in the first half of 2009, as well as against the background of Romania's conclusion of the multilateral external financing arrangement with the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and other international financial institutions. The above-mentioned developments, along with the outlook of continued disinflation in the upcoming months, highlight the need to calibrate monetary policy with the view to ensuring adequate real broad monetary conditions both for the achievement of medium-term inflation goals and for a sustainable revival of the lending process in the Romanian economy. In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 9.0 percent per annum from 9.5 percent and to continue to actively use open-market operations in order to ensure an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system. Consequently, starting July 1, 2009, the rate on the deposit facility will be lowered to 5.0 percent per annum from 5.5 percent and the rate on the credit facility (Lombard) will be 13.0 percent per annum versus 13.5 percent. At the same time, the penalty rate for deficits of leu-denominated minimum reserve requirements will drop to 19.5 percent from 20.25 percent, starting with the July 24-August 23, 2009 maintenance period. In order to ensure smooth liquidity flows, a gradual alignment to European Central Bank standards and to support sustainable lending process in the Romanian economy, the NBR Board has also decided to cut the minimum reserve requirements ratios on leu-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 15 percent from 18 percent and on foreign currency-denominated liabilities to 35 percent from 40 percent, both for residual maturities of up to two years, starting with the July 24-August 23, 2009 maintenance period. The NBR Board considers that these decisions will contribute to ensuring an adequate level of liquidity and a gradual return of banks' deposit and lending rates to the appropriate functional position in relation to the monetary policy rate. The NBR Board reiterates that a firm and consistent implementation of the balanced macroeconomic policy mix - monetary, fiscal and income, as well as of the structural reforms agreed within the multilateral external financing arrangement with international institutions is essential to consolidating disinflation and financial stability. The NBR will closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so that, by using its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. In line with the announced calendar the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for August 4, 2009, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Euroarea,2009-07-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference here in Luxembourg. I would like to thank Governor Mersch for his kind hospitality and to express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of the meeting of the Governing Council. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates remain appropriate taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 June 2009. The fall of annual inflation rates into negative territory in June is in line with previous expectations and reflects mainly temporary effects. After a return to positive inflation rates, we expect price developments to remain dampened over the policy-relevant horizon. Recent data releases and survey information provide further indications that economic activity over the remainder of this year is likely to remain weak but should decline less strongly than was the case in the first quarter of 2009. This assessment incorporates adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. Looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected by mid-2010. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The outcome of the monetary analysis corroborates the assessment of low inflationary pressure, as money and credit indicators continue to be weak. Against this background, we expect the current episode of extremely low or negative inflation rates to be short-lived and price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. Let me now explain our assessment in further detail, starting with the economic analysis. The data and survey information that have become available since our last press conference in early June have broadly confirmed our previous expectations. Economic activity over the remainder of this year is expected to remain weak but should decline less strongly than was the case in the first quarter of 2009. Looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected by mid-2010. The significant policy stimuli in all major economic areas should support growth globally, including in the euro area. In the view of the Governing Council, the risks to the economic outlook are balanced. On the positive side, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve more quickly than currently expected. On the other hand, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the turmoil in financial markets, further increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures, increasingly unfavourable labour markets and, lastly, adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation was, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, -0.1 % in June, compared with 0.0% in May. As explained on previous occasions, the further decline in annual rates of inflation was anticipated and reflects primarily base effects resulting from past sharp swings in global commodity prices. Looking ahead, owing to these base effects, annual inflation rates are projected to remain temporarily in negative territory over the coming months, before turning positive again. Such short-term movements are not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Consistent with available forecasts and projections, looking further ahead, inflation is expected to remain in positive territory, while price and cost developments are expected to remain dampened in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. In this respect, indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. On the downside they relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity, while on the upside they relate to higher than expected commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm a continued deceleration in monetary dynamics. In May, the annual growth rate of M3 declined further to 3.7%, with that of loans to the private sector falling further to 1.8%  the lowest rates since the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union. This concurrent deceleration supports the assessment of a slower underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. In May, the outstanding amounts of most components of M3 showed a contraction, reflecting, to a large extent, the recent declines in interest rates paid on short-term deposits and marketable instruments and the increased allocation of funds to instruments outside M3 that these may have fostered. Following a substantial strengthening in April, the growth of M1, while having remained strong, also moderated in May. The short-term developments in M3 have been volatile over the past few months. Looking beyond this volatility, the pace of monetary expansion has clearly slowed since the last quarter of 2008. The flow of bank loans to non-financial corporations and households has remained subdued, reflecting in part the weakening in economic activity and the continued low levels of business and consumer confidence. A moderate monthly contraction in the outstanding amount of loans to non-financial corporations has been observed over recent months. These developments are mostly due to a decline in short-term lending, while the flow of loans with longer maturities has remained slightly positive. In this respect, it is important to note that past reductions in key ECB rates have continued to be passed on through lending rates to both non-financial corporations and households. The resulting improvement in financing conditions should provide ongoing support for economic activity in the period ahead. However, as we have stressed in the past given the challenges that lie ahead, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector, particularly as regards recapitalisation. To sum up, the current rates remain appropriate taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 4 June 2009. The fall of annual inflation rates into negative territory in June is in line with previous expectations and reflects mainly temporary effects. After a return to positive inflation rates, we expect price developments to remain dampened over the policy-relevant horizon. Recent data releases and survey information provide further indications that economic activity over the remainder of this year is likely to remain weak but should decline less strongly than was the case in the first quarter of 2009. This assessment incorporates adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. Looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected by mid-2010. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis corroborates the assessment of low inflationary pressure, as money and credit indicators continue to be weak. Against this background, we expect the current episode of extremely low or negative inflation rates to be short-lived and price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, our policy action should progressively feed through to the economy in full. Hence, with all the measures taken, monetary policy will provide ongoing support for households and corporations. The Governing Council would like to recall that the Eurosystem provided a significant amount of liquidity to euro area banks at its recent first 12-month longer-term refinancing operation. This operation at a fixed interest rate of 1% is expected to strengthen further the liquidity position of banks and to support the normalisation of money markets and the extension of credit to the economy alongside the other measures of enhanced credit support. Once the macroeconomic environment improves, the Governing Council will ensure that the measures taken are quickly unwound and that the liquidity provided is absorbed. Hence, any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term can be effectively countered in a timely fashion. As has been emphasised many times, the Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, the Governing Council welcomes the spring 2009 orientations for euro area fiscal policies as agreed by the euro area finance ministers in June. A return to sound, sustainable public finances, thus strengthening overall macroeconomic stability, must be ensured. Against this background, euro area governments should prepare and communicate ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. In the view of the Governing Council, the structural adjustment process should start in any case not later than the economic recovery. To correct the envisaged large fiscal imbalances of euro area countries, structural consolidation efforts will need to exceed significantly the benchmark of 0.5% of GDP per annum set in the Stability and Growth Pact. In countries with high deficits and/or debt ratios the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1% of GDP. Turning to structural policies, there is a need to intensify efforts to support potential growth in the euro area. Given the negative impact of the financial crisis on employment, investment and the capital stock, it is crucial to accelerate the implementation of necessary structural reforms. In particular, product market reforms are required to foster competition and speed up restructuring and productivity growth. Furthermore, labour market reforms need to facilitate appropriate wage-setting and labour mobility across sectors and regions. At the same time, many of the policy measures taken in recent months with a view to supporting specific segments of the economy should be phased out in a timely manner. It is crucial that the focus is now on strengthening the adjustment capacity and flexibility of the euro area economy in line with the principle of an open market economy and free competition."
Nigeria,2009-07-07,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 64 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING. JULY 7, 2009 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to review and discuss the latest domestic and international developments and their implications for the Nigerian economy. The Committee noted the continued adverse effects of weak global demand and falling crude oil production on Nigeria's external and fiscal performance during the second quarter of the year. The MPC noted the reported prospects of economic recovery in some emerging market economies. However this development is not likely to offset the continued weak economic performance in advanced economies. In view of the openness of the Nigerian economy, the Committee observed that the growth prospects may weaken in the remainder of 2009, more so that inflationary tendencies appear to be persisting. Key Economic and Financial Developments Domestic Output Provisional data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at 1990 constant basic prices grew by 485 per cent in the first quarter of 2009. It is estimated to grow by 513 per cent in the second quarter of 2009 compared with 520 per cent in the corresponding period of 2008. The non-oil sector is estimated to grow by 803 per cent in the second quarter of 2009 mainly as a result of the performance of agriculture (284 per cent); wholesale and retail trade (220 per cent); and services (228 per cent). The NBS forecast showed a lower growth of 575 per cent in overall real GDP for 2009, compared with 641 per cent in 2008, notwithstanding the projected weak performance of the global economy. Price Developments Inflation The Committee noted the marginal decline in headline year-on-year inflation rate to 132 per cent in May from 133 per cent in April 2009. The persistence of high food inflation at 157 per cent in May compared with 153 per cent in April remains a matter of serious concern given its overwhelming weight in the consumer price index (CPI) basket. It is, however, expected that the headline inflation would slow down in the coming months on account of slack demand and the likely improvement in the supplies of agricultural produce. Monetary Developments Provisional data indicated that broad money (M2) decelerated sharply by 49 per cent in the first five months of 2009 in contrast with the growth of 299 per cent during the corresponding period of 2008. On a year-on-year basis. M2 grew by 156 per cent, mainly on account of the decline in net foreign assets and slowdown in credit to private sector. The decline in net foreign assets reflected the fall in oil export receipts and deceleration in other inflows, calling for policy initiatives to improve the availability of foreign exchange in the system. The slowdown in credit to private sector is not unconnected with the slack domestic demand as well as financial squeeze, requiring a combination of credit and structural measures to ensure that there 2 are no enduring adverse effects of credit slowdown on growth and employment. Interest Rates Key interest rates at the inter-bank market rose in May and June 2009. The weighted average inter-bank call rate on unsecured transactions stood at 125 per cent in April, 132 per cent in May and 186 per cent in June. In the first few days of July, the inter-bank call rate ranged from 21 to 22 per cent. The weighted average open buy back rates in April. May and June were 71, 72 and 77 per cent, respectively. The average spread between the call rates and the rates on secured transactions has been very high at 1090 basis points in June, 600 basis points in May and 540 basis points in April. The average prime lending rate rose from 1934 per cent in April to 1953 per cent in May 2009 while the average maximum lending rate declined from 2317 per cent in April to 2286 per cent in May. The weighted average rate on all categories of deposits rose from 598 per cent in April to 613 per cent in May 2009. Thus the spread between the two rates is higher than the current inflation rate, which provides a unique opportunity to banks to improve efficiency and reduce lending rates. Exchange Rates The MPC noted with satisfaction that recent measures to stabilize the Naira exchange rate have posted some positive outcomes. The Naira exchange rate has stabilized at the rDAS in recent weeks while in the other segments, the rates have appreciated, thereby narrowing the arbitrage opportunities. However, the premium over the rDAS rate has remained significant. The present situation offers an opportunity to further narrow the gap between the two rates by measures aimed at further liberalizing the inter-bank foreign exchange market. External Reserves Foreign exchange reserves as at July 03, 2009 amounted to US$4319 billion (provisional) compared with US$53 billion at end December 2008. The decline in reserves mirrored mainly the relative downward drift in international crude oil prices from the levels reached in mid-2008 and the slowdown of other foreign exchange inflows. However the decline in reserves is likely to moderate in the next two quarters owing to the expected rise in international crude oil demand arising from recent reports of improvement in the recovery prospects in the US and other developed countries and in the relatively favorable outlook for growth in some important emerging economies. The Stance of Policy The Committee noted that the recent economic and financial developments point to the need for policies to be focused on growth, exchange rate and financial market dynamics. Monetary and credit policies have to be therefore properly integrated with exchange rate policies. The stance of monetary policy in the coming months would be assure that liquidity, both domestic and foreign currency, is adequate to meet genuine demand and that real lending rates are moderated. To match these forces for bringing about stability in foreign exchange and domestic money markets, the CBN would 4 undertake suitable foreign exchange and domestic open market operations in a coordinated manner in the coming months. For this purpose, the CBN would announce an advance calendar of its operations for each week so that market expectations are formed in a manner that is conducive to the realization of the objectives of policy. The CBN also proposes to have in place firm consultation procedures with bank executives prior to and after the policy meetings as a condition for bringing about a more open and transparent monetary policy. Decisions In the light of the above, the Monetary Policy Committee decided as follows: A Interest Rate Policy 1) The Committee affirms the clearly established empirical evidence of a strong nexus between low real interest rates and economic growth. However the strategy for achieving low interest rates will need to be based on market forces and involve a deliberate and painstaking effort aimed at addressing structural problems that had lead to high interest rates. All caps and floors imposed thus far by the Bankers' Committee have turned out to be unenforceable and counter-productive. Only a minority of banks are fully compliant. The Committee has, therefore, removed those caps. 2) The wide divergence between inter-bank rates and the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) exerts pressures on lending rates. As part of the strategy for achieving convergence, the Monetary Policy Framework which has the interest rate corridor as an important component is hereby restored. Consequently the MPR would be reduced from 800 per cent to 600 per cent per annum. The corridor of interest rates would be +/- 200 basis points, with the rate on the standing lending facility at 800 per cent and the rate on the standing deposit facility at 400 per cent. 3) It is recognized that high inter-bank rates are substantially driven by the refusal of banks to lend to each other because of perceived counter-party risk. Whereas steps are being taken by the CBN to address this problem through proper bank audits, appropriate resolution frameworks and enhanced disclosure and transparency in financial statements, these will take some time before finalization and full restoration of confidence in the system. In view of the dire consequences to the real sector and the banks themselves of a sustained regime of excessively high interest rates, it is important to de-risk the inter-bank market and address the concerns of lenders and investors while the regulatory reforms are in progress. Consequently the CBN shall provide a guarantee on all inter- bank placements from July 2009 to March 31, 2010. This guarantee is also extended to placements with banks by pension funds. Details of operational modalities will be discussed at the Bankers' Committee meeting. However a condition for this guarantee is that pricing must reflect the credit enhancement it 6 provides. Overnight placements shall not be priced higher than MPR + 2%. maximum spread of 300, 400 and 500 basis points above the MPR shall be maintained for tenors up to 30, 60 and 90 days, respectively. This will lay the foundation for evolving a risk-free yield curve at the short end. The CBN expects to conclude its work on diagnosis, resolution and disclosure policy in the banking system, latest by March 31, 2010. 4) In view of the CBN guarantee of the interbank market transactions, there will be no new loans on the Expanded Discount Window (EDW) and no extension of maturing obligations. Furthermore all banks are required to liquidate their obligations under the EDW facility at maturity. Foreign Exchange Market 1) The inter-bank foreign exchange will be liberalized with immediate effect and wDAS replaces rDAS. 2) All other restrictions imposed recently are removed and the net open position limit for banks is increased to 5% of banks' capital base. 3) All Class ‘B' Bureaux-de-Change may now participate directly in the CBN window. Only those with valid licences are eligible. However they will make a caution deposit of $20,,00000 each. 4) Class ‘A' BDCs capital requirement is hereby reduced from N500 million to N250 million. 5) Allocation of foreign exchange will differ in magnitude between Class ‘A' and ‘B' BDCs, given the different levels of capitalization.

Philippines,2009-07-08,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to reduce the BSP's key policy interest rates by 25 basis points to 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility, effective immediately. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were reduced accordingly. This is the sixth time since December 2008 that the BSP has cut its policy interest rates. The Monetary Board reduced policy rates further based on the latest baseline forecasts showing average inflation keeping within the target ranges for 2009 and 2010. Given prevailing downside pressures on prices and output due to the impact of weaker global economic activity on domestic demand, the reduction in policy rates will support economic activity as banks are expected to pass on the lower borrowing costs to clients. The Monetary Board reiterated its resolve to provide support to economic activity to the extent that the inflation outlook allows. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that significant monetary easing has already taken place since December 2008, with key policy rates being reduced by a total of 200 basis points and liquidity provision being undertaken through lower reserve requirements, a larger rediscounting budget, and easier access to the rediscounting facility. With considerable monetary stimulus already in place, and the impact of fiscal action already in the pipeline, the Monetary Board believes that prevailing monetary settings are appropriately calibrated to the outlook for inflation and domestic demand. Going forward, the Monetary Board will continue to pay close attention to signs of global demand recovery as well as to possible build-ups in commodity price pressures over the medium term, with a view to undertaking timely action towards a non-inflationary recovery in economic activity."
Chile,2009-07-09,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 9 July 2009 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to reduce the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 0.50% (annual), and to adopt complementary monetary policy measures. Internationally, recent data show that global growth prospects for this year have stabilized. However, financial indicators reflect increased uncertainty with respect to the strength of the global recovery. Commodity prices, particularly those of copper and oil, have fallen. Domestically, available information for the second quarter of this year is consistent with a lower level of output and demand than was projected in the latest Monetary Policy Report. Unemployment has increased. Lending conditions remain tight. In June, the set of inflation indicators showed reduced core inflationary pressures. Wage dynamics continue to be in line with historical patterns, while the real exchange rate has dropped since the last meeting. Reduced y-o-y inflation figures are foreseen for the coming quarters, below those forecast in the last Report. Medium-term inflation expectations have fallen marginally. Today's decision places the monetary policy rate in its minimum level. The Board estimates that, for projected inflation to reach 3% over the policy horizon within a context of a foreseen widening of the output gap and reduced imported costs pressures, it is necessary to increase the monetary stimulus. Therefore, the monetary policy rate will be held at this minimum level for a prolonged period of time. To reinforce this decision and align financial asset prices with the path of monetary policy, the Board has decided to implement the following complementary monetary policy measures: • To establish a term liquidity facility (Facilidad de Liquidez a Plazo. FLAP) for banking institutions, whereby it will grant 90- and 180-day liquidity at the prevailing level of the monetary policy rate. • To adjust the program of Central Bank note issuance at maturities below one year, in consistency with the aforesaid decision. • To suspend, for the rest of 2009, the issuance of debt instruments maturing in or after one year, corresponding to two-year Central Bank peso-denominated bonds (BCP-2) and one-year Central Bank notes (PDBC-360). * The Spanish original prevails. The Board reiterates that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation reaches 3% over the policy horizon."
South Korea,2009-07-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. Domestic economic activity now appears to be emerging from its downward trend thanks to the proactive fiscal and monetary policy strive. The slump in domestic demand and exports has moderated. There still remains a high degree of uncertainty as to the economic growth path due to the rise in international raw material prices and the economic slowdown in the major advanced economies. Consumer price inflation has continued to decelerate thanks to the easing of demand-pull pressures owing to the economic downturn. The mild upward trend of real estate prices has been maintained. Financial market price variables such as the exchange rate and stock prices have sustained their stable pattern of movements. Bank lending has steadily expanded, mainly driven by mortgage loans. Meanwhile, concerns about credit risk and the shortermism of market funds have not been resolved. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain accommodative policy stance for the time being and do what is needed to bring about the continuation of the recent improving pattern of economic movements and financial market stabilization."
Peru,2009-07-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2009 BCRP REDUCED REFERENCE INTEREST RATE TO 2.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to reduce the monetary policy reference interest rate from 3.0 to 2.0 percent. This is the sixth month of consecutive reductions, as a result of which this rates accumulates a reduction of 450 basis points so far this year. This decision is based on the sustained reduction observed in the rate of inflation from 6.7 percent in December to 3.06 percent in June, on the reduction of inflation expectations to 2 percent, and on the slowdown observed in terms of economic activity. With this new reduction, the reference interest rate has reached a historical minimum, thus consolidating a significant monetary stimulus. The implementation of future adjustments in this rate will depend on the evolution of the main macroeconomic indicators. Inflation in June recorded a rate of -0.34 percent, as a result of which accumulated inflation in the last 12 months declined for the seventh consecutive month, falling very close to the target range. Inflation and inflation expectations are expected to continue declining in the next months, which would allow inflation's convergence to the target range in this month and the rate of inflation to be within the lower band of the target range at the end of the year. The Board also approved to reduce the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 2.80 percent. Overnight deposits: 1.20 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the next month on its session of August 6, 2009."
Thailand,2009-07-15,"No 28/ 2009 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 15 July 2009 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Assistant Governor. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments alongside with the latest inflation conditions in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. The global financial crisis continued to exert downward pressure on major and Asian economies. Nevertheless since the previous meeting, the global economy and international financial conditions had gradually improved with the rate of decline in economic activities moderating, though some fragility remained. In addition, accommodative monetary policy stance and fiscal stimulus packages in many countries would help foster an expansion of the global economy in the period ahead. The MPC assessed that the growth of the Thai economy would improve going forward provided that the global economic recovery sustained and the fiscal impetus started to intensify. Current monetary policy remained accommodative and would be supportive of an economic recovery in a subdued inflation environment. The MPC therefore decided to maintain the policy interest rate at 125 per cent per annum. The committee would continue to closely monitor developments in domestic and external economic conditions and would stand ready to implement appropriate monetary policy to ensure an orderly economic recovery."
Turkiye,2009-07-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 8.75 percent to 8.25 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 11.25 percent to 10.75 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. is decreased from 4.75 percent to 4.25 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 14.25 percent to 13.75 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 10.25 percent to 9.75 percent. Recent data releases signal that the recovery in domestic economic activity will be slow and protracted. Although there are signs of partial improvement in private consumption spending, its strength and resilience remain to be seen. External demand remains weak, domestic investment demand continues to contract, and labor market conditions are not expected to recover in the near term. Therefore, inflation is expected to remain at low levels for a long period of time. The tightness in financial conditions continues to some extent, and uncertainties regarding the impact of the problems in financial markets on the real economy persist, suggesting that downside risks still remain. Therefore, the Committee reiterates that it will be necessary for the monetary policy to maintain an easing bias for a long period of time and envisages that further measured rate cuts will be necessary in the short term unless there is a robust recovery in the economic activity. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Georgia,2009-07-22,"22.07.09 The NBG Keeps its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) unchanged at 6 Percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on July 22, 2009 and decided to keep its main policy rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 6 percent. The annual rate of inflation was 2.3 percent in June and the average annual inflation stands at 5.4 percent. The inflation outlook has not changed significantly since the Committee's last meeting and inflation is expected to remain at a low level throughout the year. The latest economic data which has become available since the Committee's last meeting indicates that the rate of economic growth has slowed by more than expected. Accordingly, the NBG's forecast for economic growth has been adjusted downwards. The current projection is that the contraction in the gross domestic product should exceed 4 percent in 2009. The latest figures on remittances are encouraging. Relative to the last month, private money transfers in June have increased, and the annual rate of decline has slowed down, which in the end should help increase domestic demand and will contribute to economic stabilization. It is noteworthy that according to the latest budget supplement the budget deficit is expected to increase considerably. Along with the decline in lending by commercial banks, the increase in budgetary expenditures should aid in the stimulation of the economy. The budgetary expenditures will in part be financed through the issuance of treasury bills. The existence of a treasury bill market should in turn, support the development of financial markets, increase the effectiveness of monetary policy, and strengthen financial stability. The National Bank of Georgia will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on August 19, 2009."
Hungary,2009-07-27,"Press release on the Monetary Council's meeting of 27 July 2009. At its meeting on 27 July 2009, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 100 basis points from 9.50% to 8.50%, with effect from 28 July 2009. Consistent with the assessment of previous months, the Monetary Council continues to judge that the Hungarian economy is undergoing a severe downturn this year and that a rapid recovery in growth is unlikely over the period ahead. Inflation rose in 2009 Q2, reflecting the combined effect of several factors. First, the weaker exchange rate relative to the average of previous years has been feeding through gradually into domestic prices. Second, shocks related to certain volatile components of the CPI also drove up overall inflation. By contrast, a more prolonged period of subdued demand limits the scope for price increases, as evidenced by lower services price inflation compared with the average of previous years. Looking ahead, the Monetary Council expects inflation to be below the medium-term target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy; however, inflation is likely to be high over the next twelve months as a result of the indirect tax changes, which, in turn, adds to upside risks to inflation through expectations. Real economic adjustment has also been reflected in the substantial improvement in external balance. Current account data for 2009 Q1 showed that the adverse economic environment, the deterioration in the outlook for growth and earlier constraints on access to credit put pressure on economic agents to cut back their expenditure sharply. Although this is clearly positive from the perspective of rebalancing the economy, it also raises the possibility that domestic demand may be weakening faster than projected, and, consequently, output could decline more sharply than previously expected. Net exports may be stronger than forecast, due to a sharper-than-expected decline in imports. Global risk appetite and sentiment towards Central and Eastern Europe have stabilised in recent months, after improving in the spring. In line with this, perceptions of risk associated with the Hungarian economy also improved. As a result, favourable trends also emerged in the money and capital markets relevant for Hungary. The first foreign currency sovereign bond issue since the onset of the financial crisis was a success; and non-resident investors purchased large amounts of forint-denominated government bonds in the secondary market after a long pause. The exchange rate settled at higher levels than previously, accompanied by reduced volatility. In the Council's judgement, the recent improvements in perceptions of risk and external balance have allowed, and the developments in the real economy and inflation justified, a reduction in the central bank base rate. Interest rates may be reduced further, consistent with the inflation targeting framework, if trend inflation developments do not jeopardise price stability and if perceptions of risk allow it."
Israel,2009-07-27,"27.7.2009</td> The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate unchanged for August 2009, andis ending its program of purchasing government bonds The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for August 2009 willremain unchanged at 0.5 percent, and that on 5 August 2009 it will end itsprogram of buying government bonds. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.9 percent in June, exceeding the forecasters' expectations of a rise of between 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent. Since the beginning of 2009 the CPI has risen by 2.1 percent, mainly due to housing and energy prices, which increased by 2.8 percent and 8.1 percent respectively. The index excluding housing and energy rose by 1.3 percent since the beginning of the year. The inflation ratemeasured over the previous twelve months was 3.6 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Before the publication of the June CPI, the average of forecasters' inflation expectations twelve months forward was 2.5 percent, and expectations derived from the capital market were 2.0 percent; after the publication of the June index, these increased to 2.8 percent and 2.6 percent respectively. In the next two months the increase in the CPI is expected to be high, in part due to price increases expected to result from the changes in tax rates and government-supervised prices. The averages of forecasters' expectations are for an increase of 0.8 percent in July and 0.5 percent in August. Based on these predictions, inflation measured over the previous twelve months is expected to remain close to the upper limit of the target inflation range for most of the next twelve months. As inflation expectations increased following the publication of the June CPI, both of the forecasters and those calculated from the capital market, so did forecasts of the Bank of Israel interest rate. Although no change in the interest rate is expected for August, the average of forecaster's and capital market expectations of the Bank of Israel interest rate at the end of 2009 is about 1 percent, and in a year's time, about 2 percent. Real economic activity: Indicators and data that became availableduring the last month support the assessment that the decline in real activity slowed or even halted in the second quarter. The Bank of Israel's Companies Survey for the second quarter of 2009 indicates a net negative balance, but a significant improvement compared with the first quarter: -11 percent in the second quarter, compared with -41 percent in the first. The Bank of Israel's composite state-of-the-economy index rose by 0.2 percent in June, its first rise in about a year. The composite index for June was affected by positive foreign trade data. The purchasing managers index crossed the 50 percent line for the first time in one-and-a-half years. The increases in indices of consumer confidence in the last two months were followed by another increase this month. In June the trend of moderation in the rate of decline in both direct and indirect tax revenues that started in March 2009 continued. On the other hand, the leading index in the Companies Survey shows expectations of a further decline in activity in the third quarter, albeit a far more moderate one than that reported in the previous quarter, and it is important to note that several sectors expect growthto begin in the third quarter. The labor market and wages: The employers survey for the second quarter shows a further fall in the demand for workers, but a more moderate one than in the previous quarter. The rate of unemployment, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics trend data, continued to increase in May, and reached 8.4 percent. The real wage in the three months February-April increased by 0.7 percent compared with the previous three months, and the nominal wage by 2.7 percent (annual rates, seasonally adjusted). HealthTax revenues in May and June were 1.7 percent lower than in May and June 2008, and 2.2 percent lower than in February and March 2009 (annual rates, seasonally adjusted), suggesting a continued fall in wages and/or employment. Budget data: In the first half of 2009 the budget deficit (excluding credit) totaled NIS 17.7 billion, in contrast to large budget surpluses in the first half of the years 2006-08. The large deficit wasdue mainly to the steep drop in tax revenues that started in the middle of 2008. After deducting the effect of tax rate changes and one-off receipts,tax revenues in the first half of the year were 11.7 percent lower, in real terms, than in the first half of 2008. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the monetary policy discussions of 21 June and 26 July, the shekel strengthened by 2.2 percent against the dollar, and by 0.3 percent against the euro. In terms of the index of the effective exchange rate vis-?-vis the currencies of Israel's trading partners (weighted by the volume of trade), the shekel strengthened by 0.9 percent. The strengthening of the shekel derived mainly from theweakening of the dollar around the world, and was supported by the positive indicators relating to Israel's economy published during the month, and the June CPI, which exceeded expectations. The capital and money markets: Between 21 June and 26 July the Tel Aviv 25 share price index and the Tel Aviv 100 index rose by about 11 percent, and reached their September 2008 levels, i.e., before the deterioration in the crisis. Most leading share price indices around the world also showed upward trends. Yields on unindexed 10-year Israeli government bonds declined by 11 basis points to 5.4 percent, and yields on US government 10-year bonds fell by a similar amount to 3.66 percent, so that over the period the yield gap between Israeli government bonds and US government bonds hardly changed, and remained at about 1.7 percentage points. In the corporate bond market, prices increased and yields fell. The Tel-Bond 20 index increased by 1.5 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 2.6 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, remained unchanged this month. The CDS spreads of many other countries contracted slightly. The money supply: In the last twelve months the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) has grown by 56 percent,and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits up to one year) by 18 percent. The steep increase in M 1 was due mainly to the public's switching from time deposits to current accounts in light of the low level of interest on the deposits that are included in M 2. The rate of increase of the M 1 aggregate has slowed in the last two months. The world economy: Data indicating that the global recession is approaching its end continued to accumulate this month. The financial reporting season, which started on a positive note, together with encouraging macroeconomic data, strengthened the optimistic assessments regarding the end of the recession. Central bank and government expansionary policies around the world became more cautious: the pace of interest rate reductions slowed, and there were hints that the use of unusual steps was drawing to a close. Nevertheless, in the closing announcement of the G 8 conference, the participants declared that the global economic situation did not yet justify reducing the existing programs introduced to deal with the crisis. The stabilization of commodity and energy prices, and the assessment that they would not continue to rise steeply, on the one hand, and the reduced level of concern regarding the persistence of the deep recession, on the other, were expressed in most leading economies by moderate inflation expectations. In thelast two weeks the financial markets witnessed a steep increase in share and corporate bond prices. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate unchanged for August at its current low level, and to continue foreign currency purchases, together with the decision to stop purchasing government bonds, will help strengthen the economy's ability to cope with the effects of the global economic crisis. The main considerations behind the decisions are: Following the high June CPI, inflation over the previous twelve months reached 3.6 percent, and one-year forward inflation expectations are close to the upper limit of the target inflation range. The increases in the CPI are expected tobe high in the next two months too, mainly because of the increases in VATand government-supervised prices. Nonetheless, the output gap and unemployment constitute forces that will moderate price increases thereafter. Data and indicators from surveys on real activity in Israel obtained this month strengthen the assessment that the reduction in GDP is moderating and may actually have ended. That said, in light of the uncertainty regarding developmentsin the global economy it is too early to determine whether this representsa turning point. In addition, the rapid improvement in the financial markets contributes to the recovery of economic activity. Many central banks around the world are keeping their interest rates low and are continuing to operate the additional monetary instruments they introduced. In this situation, the Bank of Israel's decision to keep the interest rate unchanged for August and to end the program of bond purchases as plannedstrikes a balance between the pressures raising prices, which are expectedto moderate following the expected one-off price increases, and the assessment that the economy has not yet emerged from the recession. The Bank of Israel will stop buying government bonds on the secondary market on 5 August 2009, and hereby announces that it does not intend to sellthe securities it purchased. It notes that open-market activity (buying, selling, central bank lending of government securities) is an important central bank instrument in implementing its monetary policy. The view in the Bank of Israel is that the purchases of bonds that the Bank started on 25 March 2009 helped the capital market to return to more normal functioning, particularly with regard to the renewal of issues and raising capital by the business sector. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments, and will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives--price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on 10 August 2009. The decision regarding the interest rate for September 2009 will be published at 17:30 on 24 August 2009. 27.7.2009</td> The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate unchanged for August 2009, andis ending its program of purchasing government bonds.

India,2009-07-28,"First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2009-10 Press Statement by Dr.D. Subbarao. Governor ""This morning. I had a meeting with the chiefs of major banks where we announced the monetary policy of the Reserve Bank for the remaining period of 2009- 10 in the light of the macroeconomic developments so far. The meeting also provided a valuable opportunity for the Reserve Bank and the commercial banks to understand and appreciate each other's perspectives. Bankers generally welcomed the Reserve Bank's policy stance. They felt that the status quo on policy rates would anchor interest rate expectations that could spur investment demand. They indicated that they are seeing signs of revival in the domestic economy and expect credit demand to pick up in the second half of the year. In this context. I emphasised the need to increase the flow of credit, particularly to agriculture and micro, small and medium enterprises. Banks were concerned that their liability structure is getting shorter with the reduction in the term structure of deposits, while the asset structure is getting elongated on account of the increasing share of long-term loans, particularly infrastructure. Several banks also indicated that the share of current and savings (CASA) deposits has been declining, which would put pressure on their net interest margins (NIM). As regards credit quality, banks were of the view that non- performing assets (NPAs) are expected to increase, particularly, in the unsecured segments, although they will remain manageable. Going forward, public sector banks emphasised the need for raising capital as risk-weighted assets expand in their asset portfolio. Global Economy The global economy is showing incipient signs of stabilisation, albeit not recovery. The pace of decline in economic activity in several major advanced economies has slowed, frozen credit markets have thawed and equity markets have begun to recover. Recent months have also witnessed industrial activity reviving in a number of emerging market economies. Notwithstanding some positive signs, the path and the time horizon for global recovery remain uncertain in the light of subdued consumption demand, increased unemployment levels and in anticipation of further contraction in global trade and private capital flows. Business and consumer confidence are yet to show definitive signs of revival but the financial sector appears to be stabilising in response to concerted actions taken by governments and central banks across the world, economic recession in the real sector persists. According to the latest assessment by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economy is projected to shrink by 1.4 per cent in 2009 before recovering and expanding by 2.5 per cent in 2010. The IMF, however, upgraded the growth outlook for developing Asia citing improved prospects in China and India. The Crisis and India The Indian economy experienced a significant slowdown in 2008-09, in comparison with the robust growth performance in the preceding five years, largely due2 to the knock-on effect of the global financial crisis. India's exports contracted during eight straight months which, in turn, impacted the industrial sector and the services sector. The financial sector, however, remained relatively unaffected despite the severe stress created by the global deleveraging process, which triggered capital outflows in the second half of 2008-09. Quick and aggressive policy responses both by the Government and the Reserve Bank mitigated the impact of the global financial crisis. The large domestic demand bolstered by the government consumption, provision of forex and rupee liquidity coupled with sharp cuts in policy rates, a sound banking sector and well- functioning financial markets helped cushion the economy from the worst impact of the crisis. There are now progressive signs of recovery in India: food stocks have increased; industrial production has turned positive; corporate performance has improved; business confidence surveys are optimistic; leading indicators show an upturn; interest rates have declined; credit off-take has picked up after May 2009; stock prices have rebounded; the primary capital market has witnessed some activity; and external financing conditions have improved. On the other hand, there are some negative signs: delayed and deficient monsoon; food price inflation; rebound in global commodity prices; continuing weak external demand; and high fiscal deficit. Monetary Policy Action We have adjusted the policy rates several times in the last ten months. Currently, the repo rate is at 4.75%, the reverse repo at 3.25%, and the CRR at 5%. Consistent with our current assessment of macroeconomic and monetary conditions, we have decided to keep all these rates unchanged. Reserve Bank's Policy Thrust The thrust of the various policy initiatives by the Reserve Bank since mid- September 2008 has been on providing ample rupee liquidity, ensuring comfortable dollar liquidity and maintaining a market environment conducive for the continued flow of credit to all productive sectors. These actions have resulted in augmentation of actual/potential liquidity of over Rs.5,61,700 crore. The liquidity situation has remained comfortable since mid-November 2008 as evidenced by the LAF window where the Reserve Bank has been absorbing nearly Rs.1,20,000 crore on a daily average basis during the current financial year. The liquidity expansion has been consistent with the Reserve Bank's stance of ensuring a policy regime that will enable credit expansion at viable rates while preserving credit quality. Interest Rate Response from Banks As liquidity remains ample, the competitive pressure on banks to reduce lending rates has increased. Consequently, the transmission of policy rate changes to bank lending rates has improved since the last Annual Policy Statement in April 2009. As the short-term deposits contracted earlier at high rates mature and get repriced, it opens up room for banks to further reduce their lending rates. Government Borrowing As a result of the disruption caused by the crisis, the Government deviated from the road map for fiscal consolidation set by the FRBM Act. The deficit indicators deteriorated sharply in 2008-09 and are projected to be even higher in 2009-10. The combined net market borrowings of the Central and State Governments in 2008-09 were nearly two and half times their net borrowings in 2007-08. These are budgeted to increase further by nearly 34 per cent in 2009-10. Management of the large market borrowing programme in a non-disruptive manner requires active liquidity management and, accordingly, the Reserve Bank indicated its intention to purchase government securities under open market operations (OMO) for an indicative amount of Rs.80,000 crore during the first half of 2009-10.3 During the first half of 2009-10, net market borrowing of the Central Government through dated securities will be Rs.2,65,911 crore, of which nearly 63 per cent (Rs.1,67,911 crore) has been completed by July 27, 2009 and an additional amount of Rs.28,000 crore has been raised through de-sequestering MSS balances. The open market operations (OMO) undertaken so far have been of the order of Rs.33,439 crore, accounting for about 42 per cent of the notified amount of Rs.80,000 crore. There is, therefore, sufficient headroom available to the Reserve Bank to manage the balance borrowing smoothly. It may be noted in this context that during the first half of 2009-10, proposed OMO purchases and MSS unwinding will add primary liquidity of Rs.1,50,000 crore, which by way of monetary impact is equivalent to reduction of CRR by over 3.5 percentage points. Growth Outlook On current assessment, the growth projection for GDP for 2009-10 is placed at 6.0 per cent with an upward bias. This updated growth projection thus marks a slight improvement over the growth expectation of around 6.0 per cent indicated in the Annual Policy Statement. The overall macroeconomic scenario continues to be uncertain, although it is expected that the fiscal and monetary stimulus measures will supplement domestic demand in 2009-10. On balance, an uptrend in the growth momentum is unlikely before the middle of 2009-10. Inflation Outlook Let me now turn to the inflation prospects. WPI inflation for end-March 2010 is projected at around 5.0 per cent ─ higher than the projection of 4.0 per cent made in the Annual Policy Statement of April 2009. As anticipated, the WPI inflation turned negative in June 2009 due to the statistical base effect and not because of any contraction in demand. However, the sharp decline in WPI inflation has not been commensurately matched by a similar decline in inflation expectations. Within WPI, inflation of primary articles, particularly food articles, remains significantly positive. Moreover consumer price indices (CPIs) have remained elevated, indeed also hardened in recent months. Global commodity prices have rebounded ahead of global recovery and the uncertain monsoon outlook could further accentuate food price inflation. Risks to Growth and Inflation Outlook On balance, the risks to the current projections of real GDP growth and inflation for 2009-10 are on the upside. The comfortable levels of foodgrains stocks should help mitigate the risks in the event of price pressures from the supply side. The Reserve Bank will also closely monitor the level of liquidity so as to contain inflationary expectations if supply side price pressures were to rise. Money Supply In order to ensure that the increased Government market borrowing programme does not crowd out credit flow to the private sector, the projection of money supply (M ) 3 growth for 2009-10 has been raised to 18 per cent from 17 per cent indicated in the Annual Policy Statement. Consistent with this, aggregate deposits and adjusted non- food credit of commercial banks are projected to grow by 19 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. As always, these numbers are provided as indicative projections and not as targets. Challenges on the Way Forward There are several immediate and medium term challenges facing the economy as highlighted below:4 The first challenge is to manage the balance between the short-term compulsions of providing ample liquidity and the potential build-up of inflationary pressure on the way forward by maintaining the accommodative monetary stance till demand conditions further improve and credit flow takes hold. But we need to be ready with a roadmap to reverse the expansionary stance quickly and effectively thereafter. The second challenge is to manage the Government's large borrowing programme without crowding out present or potential private credit demand. Despite active liquidity management by the Reserve Bank, the large and abrupt increase in government borrowing has resulted in hardening of yields which clearly militated against the low interest rate regime that the economy requires in the current situation. The third challenge is to maintain policy rates and liquidity conditions conducive for spurring private investment demand, which has been dented by the crisis. The fourth challenge is to restore the fiscal consolidation process by laying down the roadmap. Large fiscal deficits, if continued strictly beyond the recovery period, can crowd out private investment and trigger inflationary pressures. The large government borrowing has already led to hardening of yields which have impeded monetary transmission. The Government will, therefore, need to return to a path of fiscal consolidation which will lend credibility to the fiscal stance and also give predictability to economic agents. It is also necessary to focus on the quality of fiscal adjustment even while pursuing quantitative targets. Finally, a big medium-term challenge is to improve the investment climate and expand the absorptive capacity of the economy by moving forward with financial sector reforms to promote financial inclusion, further widen and deepen financial markets and strengthen financial institutions while factoring in the lessons of the global economic crisis; and giving a big thrust to governance reforms, without which it is difficult to inspire the trust and confidence of potential investors. Monetary Policy Stance On the basis of the above overall assessment, the stance of monetary policy for the remaining period of 2009-10 will be as follows: Manage liquidity actively so that the credit demand of the Government is met while ensuring the flow of credit to the private sector at viable rates. Keep a vigil on the trends and signals of inflation, and be prepared to respond quickly and effectively through policy adjustments. Maintain a monetary and interest rate regime consistent with price stability and financial stability supportive of returning the economy to the high growth path. The Reserve Bank reiterates that it will maintain an accommodative monetary stance until there are definite and robust signs of recovery. This accommodative monetary stance is, however, not the steady state. On the way forward, the Reserve Bank will have to reverse the expansionary measures to anchor inflation expectations and subdue inflationary pressures while preserving the growth momentum. The exit strategy will be modulated in accordance with the evolving macroeconomic developments."" G. Raghuraj Press Release : 2009-2010/154 Deputy General Manager."
Malaysia,2009-07-29,"At the Monetary Policy Committee meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 2.00 percent. Since the previous MPC meeting, signs of stabilisation of the global economy have emerged whilst conditions in the international financial markets have generally improved. In the advanced economies, while the overall economic conditions continue to remain weak, the pace of decline in economic activity is slowing. There is also evidence of improvements in economic activity in most regional economies. Measures to stabilise the financial systems in the advanced countries, combined with the cumulative effects of fiscal and monetary stimulus, have continued to contribute towards a gradual improvement in economic activity in most countries. Conditions in the domestic economy have also shown signs of stabilising in the second quarter, with several indicators such as the industrial production index and retrenchments recording a slower pace of decline. Going forward, improvements in labour market conditions and business and consumer sentiments will provide support to domestic demand. In addition, the accelerated implementation of the fiscal stimulus, the continued access to financing and the lower rate of inflation will also contribute to the improvement in the domestic economy in the second half of 2009 and into 2010. In accordance with expectations, inflation continued to moderate and turned negative in June. The decline in inflation is largely a statistical outcome reflecting the sharp rise in inflation in June 2008, when fuel prices increased following the reduction in fuel subsidies. The negative inflation is expected to be temporary and is projected to turn positive as domestic economic conditions improve. The assessment is that with the current low interest rates and with the fiscal stimulus gaining traction, the prevailing policy measures are sufficient to provide support to economic activity.

Poland,2009-07-29,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 29 July 2009 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 28-29 July 2009 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate at 3.50 % on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 3.75% on an annual basis. Recently released data suggest that in 2009 Q2 GDP declined further in most EU countries and other developed economies. However, some economic indicators suggest that recession may be gradually fading out. Though in the past few months forecasts of economic growth in the euro area have been revised further downwards, the outlook for economic growth in the world economy, including the United States, has shown some improvement. Major developed economies have recorded a decline in the general price level, which is due to the slowdown in the world economic growth and the previously observed drop in commodity prices. Yet, in the past few months some commodity prices in the world markets have increased again. In 2009 Q2 economic activity in Poland remained subdued which is reflected in the decline in industrial output and the low growth of construction and assembly production, as well as retail sales. At the same time, those indicators have recently been better than expected, and some business tendency indicators point to a certain improvement in the sentiment of enterprises, although it continues to be low. The labour market has deteriorated further, i.e. employment in the corporate sector fell deeper and the (seasonally-adjusted) unemployment rate rose, accompanied by a further decline in the growth of nominal wages and a fall in real wages. Reduced lending, in particular to the corporate sector, constituted an additional factor conducive to curbing economic growth. In June 2009 annual CPI inflation declined to 3.5%, i.e. to the upper limit for deviations from the NBP inflation target set at 2.5%. Inflation remaining at an increased level is largely the result of the previous rises in regulated prices. Increased inflation is also driven by the persistence of inflationary processes, which is reflected, inter alia, in the relatively high  despite a certain decline  core inflation. The growth of prices of some goods and services connected with the previously observed depreciation of the zloty exchange rate is also conducive to inflation running at an elevated level, although this effect is gradually fading out. In the Council's assessment, inflation is likely to remain at an elevated level in the coming months, mainly due to the relatively high annual growth of food prices and regulated prices, including, above all, the prices of energy. The recently observed rise in crude oil prices, mitigated to a certain extent by the recent zloty exchange rate appreciation, may also be conducive to inflation remaining ul.

Yet, in the medium term a further decline in the demand pressure should reduce inflation. In the Council's assessment, the probability of inflation running below the inflation target in the medium term is higher than the probability of inflation running above the target. In the Council's view, the already implemented cuts in the NBP interest rates together with the lowering of the required reserve rate will support the return of the economy to the potential growth path. The Council's decisions in the coming months will take account of incoming information about the outlook for economic growth and inflation, the situation in the financial markets in Poland and abroad, and information about the public finance sector as well as zloty exchange rate developments. The Council will continue to analyse the impact of developments in the domestic interbank market on the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Poland. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts required for euro adoption in Poland. The Council approved The Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland in 2009 Q1."
Egypt,2009-07-30,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release July 30, 2009 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to cut its overnight deposit rate by 50 bps to 85 percent per annu. The discount rate was also cut by 50 bps to 85 percent per annu. In its meeting held on July 30, 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut its overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate by 50 bps to 85 percent and 10 percent, respectivel. Annual headline CPI inflation continued to decline reaching an 18-month low of 99 percent in June 2009, compared to 102 percent in May, down from the 236 percent peak recorded in August 200. It is important to underscore that during the first six months of 2009, transient supply shocks mainly related to volatile food items, namely fruits and vegetables, have emerge. While these shocks have flattened the disinflation path, they do not characterize the underlying inflationary pressure. Inflation excluding fruits and vegetables accumulated in the first six months of 2009 reached 31 percent compared to the 115 percent accumulated in 2008H1, reflecting the evident change in the inflation dynamic. In the meantime, the global financial crisis continues to interrupt the domestic growth momentum, bringing domestic GDP growth in 2008/09 Q3 to 43 percent compared to 7 percent on average over the past three year. Moreover despite tentative signs that the worst of the global downturn may be over, consensual projections point to a sluggish and uneven global economic recovery in 201. Accordingly current CBE projections point to a further softening of domestic GDP growth, pushing the output gap to negative territor. Against this background, the MPC's assessment of the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and growth outlook over the medium-term remains unchanged as risks to the domestic growth outlook continue to be on the downside while inflationary pressures are subsidin. The MPC will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global economic turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objectiv.

Romania,2009-08-04,"In its meeting of August 4, 2009, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for August 6, 2009. The annual inflation rate stood at 5.86 percent in June versus 5.95 percent in May and this year's peak of 6.89 percent in February 2009. The adjusted annual CORE2 inflation  calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruits, eggs and fuel) as well as the effects of vice tax  dropped to an annual rate of 4.79 percent in June from 5.04 percent in the previous month. The consolidation of the disinflation process was the result of slower dynamics of fuel and food prices amid a contraction in aggregate demand and of moderation in the volatility of the leu exchange rate. The money market functioning saw positive developments, with interbank rates stabilizing around the monetary policy rate level, while lending and deposit rates for non-bank customers saw a further fall amid a relative attenuation of the discrepancy between their levels and the ones of the monetary policy rate and interbank rates. The analysis of external financial indicators shows significant improvements, highlighted by a substantial narrowing of the current account deficit, a reduction in the level of short-term private external debt and an increase in hard currency reserves. The shift in the structure of foreign currency reserves due to the lower proportion of resources coming from foreign currency-denominated minimum reserve requirements is also worth noting. The monetary policy stance remained prudent, with the NBR permanently calibrating its broad monetary conditions with the view to consolidating the convergence of inflation towards medium-term objectives and ensuring favorable conditions for a sustainable revival of lending activity. In light of the available data and of the assessment of recent and upcoming developments, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 8.5 percent per annum from 9.0 percent. Consequently, starting August 5, 2009, the rate on the deposit facility will be lowered to 4.5 percent per annum from 5.0 percent and the rate on the credit facility (Lombard) will be 12.5 percent per annum versus 13.0 percent. At the same time, the penalty rate for deficits of leu-denominated minimum reserve requirements will drop to 18.75 percent from 19.5 percent, starting with the August 24-September 23, 2009, maintenance period. The NBR Board also decided to continue to actively use open-market operations to ensure an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and to lower the maturity of its main instrument, the auction-based repo operations, to one week from one month. In order to ensure smooth liquidity flows and the continuation of a gradual alignment to European Central Bank standards, the NBR Board has also decided to cut the minimum reserve requirements ratio on hard currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 30 percent, from 35 percent, for residual maturities of up to two years starting with the August 24-September 23, 2009, maintenance period. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses the recent macroeconomic environment and the inflation outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The Report will be presented to the public in a news conference scheduled for August 6, 2009. The perspectives show a continuation of the disinflation process, though the outlook is still influenced by the developments in the international crisis and the persistence of significant structural rigidities of the domestic economy. The consolidation of disinflation, maintaining financial stability and the creation of prerequisites for a sustainable relaunch of economic activity require a firm and consistent implementation of the macroeconomic policy mix  monetary, fiscal and income  as well as of the structural reforms agreed under the multilateral external financing arrangement with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions. The NBR Board reaffirms that the NBR will continue to closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so that, by using its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for September 29, 2009."
Euroarea,2009-08-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 2 July 2009 confirm our view that the current rates remain appropriate. As anticipated, annual HICP inflation in July fell further into negative territory, reflecting mainly temporary effects. After a return to positive inflation rates during the second half of the year, we continue to expect price developments to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. Recent data releases and survey information still suggest that economic activity over the remainder of this year is likely to remain weak, although the pace of contraction is clearly slowing down. This assessment takes into account adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. Looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure, as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate. Against this background, we expect the current episode of extremely low or negative inflation rates to be short-lived and price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. Let me now explain our assessment in further detail, starting with the economic analysis. The data and survey information that have become available since our meeting on 2 July 2009 have broadly confirmed our previous expectations. While uncertainty is still high, there are increasingly signs that the global recession is bottoming out. As regards the euro area, recent surveys suggest that the pace of contraction is clearly slowing down. However, economic activity over the remainder of this year is expected to remain weak. Looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected. The significant policy stimuli in all major economic areas should support growth globally, including in the euro area. In the view of the Governing Council, uncertainty remains high and we have to be prepared for ongoing volatility in incoming data. On the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve more quickly than currently expected. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the turmoil in financial markets, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures, more unfavourable than expected labour market conditions and, lastly, adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation was, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, -0.6 % in July, compared with -0.1% in June. This further decline in annual rates of inflation was anticipated and reflects primarily base effects resulting from the peaks observed in global commodity prices a year ago. Looking ahead, owing to these base effects, annual inflation rates are projected to remain temporarily in negative territory, before turning positive again later this year. However, such short-term movements are not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Consistent with available forecasts and projections, looking further ahead, inflation is expected to remain in positive territory, while price and cost developments are expected to remain subdued in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. In this respect, indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. They relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and to higher than expected commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm the ongoing deceleration in broad money and credit growth. The annual growth rates of M3 and of loans to the private sector recorded in June  3.5% and 1.5% respectively  are the lowest since the start of Stage Three of EMU. These developments support the assessment of a slower underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. The declining pace of monetary expansion since the last quarter of 2008 continues to be accompanied by volatility in the short-term developments of M3 and its components. This reflects to a large extent the impact that absolute and relative changes in interest rates have had on the allocation of funds between financial investments inside and outside M3 and between the different deposit categories within M3. In this respect, the shift in allocation from short-term time deposits to overnight deposits within M3 has led to a further substantial strengthening of annual M1 growth in June. The flow of bank loans to the non-financial private sector remained subdued in June, albeit with differences across borrowing sectors. The flow of loans to non-financial corporations turned substantially more negative owing to a sharp contraction in short-term lending. At the same time, the flow of loans to households was slightly more positive than last month. The ongoing uncertainty seems to have dampened borrowers' demand for financing. However, according to the latest euro area bank lending survey, lenders tightened their credit standards to a significantly lesser extent. Given the challenges that lie ahead, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector, particularly as regards recapitalisation. To sum up, the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 2 July 2009 confirm the view of the Governing Council that the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. As anticipated, annual HICP inflation in July fell further into negative territory, reflecting mainly temporary effects. After a return to positive inflation rates during the second half of the year, we continue to expect price developments to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. Recent data releases and survey information still suggest that economic activity over the remainder of this year is likely to remain weak, although the pace of contraction is clearly slowing down. This assessment takes into account adverse lagged effects, such as a further deterioration in labour markets, which are likely to materialise over the coming months. Looking ahead into next year, after a phase of stabilisation, a gradual recovery with positive quarterly growth rates is expected. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure, as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate. Against this background, we expect the current episode of extremely low or negative inflation rates to be short-lived and price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, our policy action should progressively feed through to the economy in full. Hence, with all the measures taken, including our covered bond purchases, monetary policy will provide ongoing support for households and corporations. Once the macroeconomic environment improves, the Governing Council will take care that the measures taken are quickly unwound and that the ample liquidity provided is absorbed. Hence, any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term will be effectively countered in a timely fashion. The Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policy, we welcome the position of the Eurogroup that, given the current economic outlook and projected public deficit and debt developments, further fiscal stimulus is not warranted. Budget plans for 2010, which are currently being finalised in a number of countries, and medium-term consolidation strategies must reflect a commitment to a swift return to sound and sustainable public finances. Accordingly, governments should prepare and communicate ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. The structural adjustment process should start, in any case, not later than the economic recovery and in 2011 the consolidation efforts should be stepped up. Structural consolidation efforts will need to exceed significantly the benchmark of 0.5% of GDP per annum set in the Stability and Growth Pact. In countries with high deficits and/or debt ratios the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1% of GDP. Given the risks of lower potential economic growth in the euro area for a prolonged period of time, governments should adjust public expenditures appropriately to the new macroeconomic conditions and reverse the sharp rises in public expenditure ratios as soon as possible. This is necessary also to prepare budgets for future ageing-induced expenditure burdens. Turning to structural policies, there is a need to intensify structural reform efforts in order to support sustainable growth in the euro area. Appropriate wage-setting and sufficient flexibility to get the unemployed back into work are crucial to prevent the crisis from having a lasting negative impact on labour markets. It is therefore essential to create appropriate incentives to work. At the same time, policies to speed up restructuring and investment, in line with the principle of an open market economy and free competition, will create the business opportunities and productivity gains needed to spark a sustained recovery."
Czech Republic,2009-08-07,"Press Conference of the CNB Bank Board 5th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments August 6, 2009 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to decrease the CNB two-week repo rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.25 %, effective 7 August 2009. At the same time it decided to decrease the discount rate and Lombard rate by the same amount, to 0.25 % and 2.25 % respectively. Message ooff tthhee ffoorreeccaasstt Headline (and monetary-policy relevant) inflation will continue to fall this year. It will remain low but positive for the rest of this year and at the start of 2010. Next year inflation will start rising and will get to the 2% inflation target at the end of 2010. The economic decline bottomed out in Q2 and the quarter-on- quarter growth is expected as from 2009 Q3. However, the sharp fall in GDP at the beginning of the year will pass through into a year-on-year decline in GDP for the remainder of the year. The nominal exchange rate of the koruna is modestly appreciating over the forecast horizon. Consistent with the forecast is a decline in market interest rates this year followed by a modest rise from 2010 H2 onwards. The forecast for both headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation in 2009 and 2010 is somewhat lower than in the previous forecast. The interest rate path lies slightly below the level of the previous forecast in both 2009 and 2010. The CZK/EUR exchange rate outlook is equal to the previous forecast in 2009, whereas in 2010 is somewhat stronger.

South Korea,2009-08-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. Domestic economic activity is sustaining its improved movements thanks to the proactive fiscal and monetary policy strive and the upturn of the economic situation in emerging markets. The slump in domestic demand and exports has moderated further. There still remains uncertainty as to the economic growth path due to the likelihood of delay in the recovery of the major advanced economies. Consumer price inflation has continued to decelerate thanks to the easing of demand-pull pressures and the won's appreciation. The upward trend of real estate prices has been maintained. Market interest rates and stock prices have risen. Mortgage loans continued to expand markedly. Meanwhile, concerns about credit risk and the shortermism of market funds have not been resolved. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain accommodative policy stance for the time being and do what is needed to bring about the continuation of the recent improving pattern of economic movements and financial market stabilization."
United States,2009-08-12,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity is leveling out. Conditions in financial markets have improved further in recent weeks. Household spending has continued to show signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but are making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability. The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late. However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. As previously announced, to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year. In addition, the Federal Reserve is in the process of buying $300 billion of Treasury securities. To promote a smooth transition in markets as these purchases of Treasury securities are completed, the Committee has decided to gradually slow the pace of these transactions and anticipates that the full amount will be purchased by the end of October. The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Charles L Evans; Donald L Kohn; Jeffrey M Lacker; Dennis P Lockhart; Daniel K Tarullo; Kevin M Warsh; and Janet L Yellen."
Chile,2009-08-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 August 2009 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50% (annual), and to continue applying the complementary monetary policy measures adopted in the last meeting. Internationally, recent data show stabilizing global growth prospects for this year. These prospects have resulted in a better environment in financial markets. Commodity prices, particularly the price of copper, have increased. Domestically, available information for the second quarter of this year suggests that the weakening of economic activity has ceased. Although unemployment is still on the rise, employment has tended to stabilize. Lending conditions remain tight, despite reduced lending interest rates. In July, the set of inflation indicators showed reduced core inflationary pressures. Wage dynamics continue to be in line with historical patterns. Reduced y-o-y inflation figures are foreseen for the coming quarters. Medium-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The Board reiterates that the monetary policy rate will be held at its minimum level of 0.50% for a prolonged period of time, and that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation reaches 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Africa,2009-08-13,"1.1 There are encouraging signs that the global slowdown may have reached its lower turning point, although the speed and extent of the recovery are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The South African economy appears to be lagging behind these international developments and it is likely that the domestic economy contracted in the second quarter of this year. The domestic economy remains constrained by weak global and domestic demand. 1.2 Targeted inflation declined materially in June but is still outside the inflation target range. Expectations are that it will take some time before inflation returns to within the target range on a sustainable basis. Cost push pressures appear to be the main source of upside risk to the inflation outlook. 2.1 The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas declined from 8,0 per cent in May 2009 to 6,9 per cent in June. The main contributors to the inflation outcome were food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing and utilities, and miscellaneous goods and services. Each of these categories contributed 1,6 percentage points to CPI inflation. Petrol prices declined at a year-on-year rate of 25 per cent, despite the 17 cents per litre increase in the petrol price in June. Administered price inflation, excluding petrol prices, measured 9,1 per cent in June, with electricity prices increasing by 28,6 per cent. 2.2 Producer prices declined at a year-on-year rate of 4,1 per cent in June, compared with a decline of 3,0 per cent in May. Prices of mining and chemical products were the main contributors to this trend, but there was also further moderation in food price inflation. Prices of agricultural products declined at a year-on-year rate of 1,7 per cent while prices of manufactured food products increased at a rate of 3,7 per cent, compared with a rate of 6,2 per cent in the previous month. 3.1 The most recent CPI inflation forecast by the staff of the South African Reserve Bank remained more or less unchanged compared with the previous forecast. However. CPI inflation is still expected to continue its moderate downward trend and to enter the target range during the second quarter of 2010, and to remain within the target range for the rest of the forecast period ending 2011. 3.2 These projections are broadly in line with the Reuters consensus survey of private sector analysts. The most recent survey for July indicates that analysts expect inflation to decline to within the inflation target range during the second quarter of 2010, and to average 5,8 per cent and 5,6 per cent in 2010 and 2011 respectively. Expectations derived from the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation linked bonds have remained within the inflation target range over the short- to medium-term maturities. 3.3 The outlook for the international economy appears to have improved. The cautious optimism that the bottom of the cycle may have been reached continues to prevail, although some analysts still doubt the strength and sustainability of this recovery. The recovery is also not expected to be uniform across countries or regions. According to the July 2009 World Economic Outlook of the IMF, global output is expected to contract by 1,4 per cent in 2009 before recovering to 2,5 per cent in 2010. The developed economies are expected to grow by 0,6 per cent, while growth in emerging economies is expected to average 4,7 per cent in 2010. At this stage, global inflation appears to be under control despite the significant monetary accommodation in a number of advanced economies. 3.4 Domestic economic conditions remain subdued amid indications that the economy contracted further in the second quarter of 2009, although at a slower rate of contraction than in the previous quarter. Manufacturing production declined at a year-on-year rate of 17,1 per cent in June, and by 3 per cent in the three months to June 2009 compared with the previous three months. The utilisation of production capacity in manufacturing in May 2009 was 78 per cent, down from 84,4 per cent a year ago. The Kagiso/BER Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) declined in July, indicating that the difficult conditions in the manufacturing sector are likely to persist. However, according to the PMI, expectations of business conditions six months ahead continued to improve. Similarly the South African Reserve Bank composite leading business cycle indicator increased for a second consecutive month in May 2009, indicating the possibility of a recovery later in the year. 3.5 Household consumption expenditure growth continued to contract during the past few months. New vehicle sales declined again in July, with total vehicle sales declining by 4,5 per cent in July compared with the previous month. Total vehicle exports declined by 12 per cent on a month-on-month basis, and by 60,3 per cent on a year-on-year basis. Real retail trade sales contracted at a seasonally adjusted rate of 3,6 per cent in the second quarter of 2009 compared with the first quarter. On a year-on-year basis, retail sales declined by 6,7 per cent in June. The FNB/BER consumer confidence index increased moderately in the second quarter of 2009, although it is still at low levels. 3.6 The weak state of domestic demand is reflected in the rate of credit extension to the private sector. Year-on-year growth in total loans and advances of banks to the private sector declined from 6,3 per cent in April 2009 to 2,2 per cent in June. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, negative growth of 1,8 per cent was measured in the second quarter of 2009. Year-on-year growth in mortgage advances moderated to 8,2 per cent in June, while instalment sales credit and leasing finance, as well as other loans and advances experienced negative year-on-year growth. These declines are due in part to stricter lending criteria being applied by banks. 3.7 The impact of negative wealth effects on domestic consumption expenditure may have dissipated somewhat with the partial recovery of equity prices in the local and global markets. Since the beginning of the year, the all-share index on the JSE Limited has increased by about 14 per cent. However the index is still significantly below the levels reached in 2008. The various house price indices all show that house prices continued to decline in July, but the pace of decline appears to be moderating. 3.8 The exchange rate of the rand has remained relatively volatile, but within a range that has prevailed since May 2009 with the decline in global risk aversion. The exchange rate of the rand fluctuated between approximately R7,68 to the US dollar and R8,32 to the US dollar since the previous meeting of the MPC. Since the beginning of the year, the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand has appreciated by about 13 per cent. 3.9 As noted above, food price developments continue to be a major factor in the overall inflation outcomes. After months of relative stickiness, food price inflation at the consumer price level appears to be responding to the favourable trends at the producer price level. In June, food price inflation declined to 9,8 per cent, compared with a rate of 16,1 per cent in January 2009. 3.10 The main upside risks to the inflation outlook emanate from cost-push pressures. The international oil price has continued its stronger upward trend, as the outlook for the global economy improves. The price of North Sea Brent crude oil has remained above US$70 per barrel for most of the period since the previous meeting. Although domestic petrol prices were reduced by 21 cents per litre in July, the current under-recovery indicates that a further petrol price increase is likely in August. 3.11 Other adverse cost pressures include administered price increases, particularly electricity prices, and wage increases which have generally been in excess of inflation. According to Andrew Levy Employment publications, wage settlements in the first six months of 2009 averaged 9,7 per cent. In the first quarter of 2009, the increase in unit labour cost over four quarters amounted to 11,2 per cent. 4.1 The Monetary Policy Committee is of the view that, notwithstanding upside cost pressures, the adverse economic conditions appear to tilt the balance of risks to the inflation outlook towards the downside over the medium term. The MPC has therefore decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 7 per cent per annum with effect from 14 August 2009."
Peru,2009-08-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2009 BCRP REDUCED REFERENCE INTEREST RATE TO 1.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to reduce the monetary policy reference interest rate for the seventh consecutive month. This rate has been reduced from 2.0 to 1.25 percent, as a result of which this rates accumulates a reduction of 525 basis points so far this year. This decision is based on the sustained reduction observed in the rate of inflation from 6.65 percent in December to 2.68 percent in July and on the continuous reduction of inflation expectations. The Central Bank does not foresee inflationary pressures in the next months. Inflation in July showed a rate of 0.19 percent, as a result of which accumulated inflation in the last 12 months declined for the eighth consecutive month, falling within the target range. Inflation is expected to continue declining in the next months, showing rates close to the lower band of the target range by the end of the year. With this new reduction, the reference interest rate has reached a new historical minimum level. The reduction of the reference rate has been translating into lower interest rates in the financial system and in the capital market. Unless important modifications should occur in terms of inflation forecasts or the determinants of inflation, the need for new adjustments in the reference rate is not foreseen. The Board also approved to reduce the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 2.05 percent. Overnight deposits: 0.45 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.05 percent. The interests on reserve requirements in foreign currency corresponding to additional reserve requirements, provided that they are deposited at this Central Bank, will be equivalent to 60 percent of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR rate). The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the next month on its session of September 10, 2009."
Turkiye,2009-08-18,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 8.25 percent to 7.75 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 10.75 percent to 10.25 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. is decreased from 4.25 percent to 3.75 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 13.75 percent to 13.25 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 9.75 percent to 9.25 percent. Recent data releases indicate that the ongoing recovery in economic activity will be gradual and protracted. External demand remains weak, domestic investment demand continues to contract, and labor market conditions do not display a significant improvement. Moreover, recent developments have increased the uncertainty regarding the strength of the consumption recovery. Therefore, in line with the perspective outlined in the Inflation Report, inflation is expected to remain at low levels for a long period of time. The tightness in financial conditions continues to some extent, and uncertainties regarding the impact of the problems in financial markets on the real economy persist, suggesting that downside risks still remain. Therefore, the Committee reiterates that it will be necessary for monetary policy to maintain an easing bias for a long period of time and envisages that further measured rate cuts will be necessary in the short term unless there is a robust recovery in the economic activity. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Georgia,2009-08-19,"19.08.09 The NBG keeps its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) unchanged at 6% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on August 19, 2009 and decided to keep the main policy rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 6%. The annual rate of inflation was 0.1% in July and annual average inflation stands at 4.6%. Since the last MPC meeting there are downside risks to inflation, with the annual rate of inflation expected to be negative in August. However, it is expected to rise by the end of the year with end-period inflation of 3%-4%. Commercial banks' deposits of both legal entities and individuals have shown stable growth during the last three months. However, against the background of recent growth of deposits lending activity still remains low. Subsequently, commercial banks' balances on the corresponding accounts at the National Bank of Georgia have grown significantly. It is expected that excess liquidity will contribute to the reduction in the deposit and lending interest rates. Ministry of Finance resumed the issuance of Treasury bills on August 5th and three auctions have been held so far. In all three cases the demand was in excess of supply and the issuances were fully placed. The yields were relatively low, but together with the expected growth in credit activity, a certain rise in interest rates can occur. An electronic trade platform for the Treasury bills secondary market will start functioning in the Bloomberg trade system this week. Existence of the secondary market is essential for the Treasury bills liquidity and money market development. The expectations that economic activity is bottoming out in certain countries have been validated in the two largest economies of the EU with Germany and France both recording positive growth rates in the second quarter. The National Bank of Georgia will continue to closely monitor the ongoing developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on September 16, 2009."
Philippines,2009-08-19,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates steady at 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. The decision to maintain the monetary policy stance comes after a series of policy rate cuts since December 2008 totaling 200 basis points and other liquidity enhancing measures. The Monetary Board decision to maintain policy rates is based on its assessment that current monetary settings are appropriate and that inflation is expected to remain within target over the policy horizon. Since the transmission of monetary policy actions on the real economy works with a lag, maintaining current policy settings will allow the substantial monetary stimulus undertaken earlier to fully work its way through the system. A pause will also allow more time for the authorities to consider incoming data on the balance of risks to inflation and growth as well as the likely trend of future economic activity, given the impact of other public policies. While the current inflation outlook remains favorable, the expected global economic recovery may cause upward pressure on oil and other commodity prices. The Monetary Board is committed to maintain an appropriate monetary policy stance conducive to credit and investment growth, to the extent that the inflation outlook would allow. Going forward, the Board will continue to be guided by economic data, both domestic and external, paying close attention to the emerging risks to the inflation outlook as well as to indications of the strength of economic activity."
Hungary,2009-08-24,"At its meeting on 24 August 2009, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by 50 basis points from 8.50% to 8.00%, with effect from 25 August 2009. At its meeting, the Monetary Council also discussed the August 2009 issue of the Bank's Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Council's assessment, although the global economic environment remains uncertain, it has stabilised somewhat over recent months and there has been no further deterioration in economic prospects. However, the global and domestic economies are unlikely to recover rapidly in the near term. Hungarian economic growth is expected to resume in 2010. Inflation is likely to rise above the medium-term target temporarily, reflecting the effects of increases in indirect taxes, and move substantially below it in the second half of 2010. The decline in domestic demand played a greater role in the contraction of the domestic economy than earlier expected, due primarily to sharp reductions in firms' stocks and larger-than-anticipated cutbacks in investment. In addition, household consumption continued to decline rapidly. Rising uncertainty about the outlook for employment and incomes, coupled with tightening credit conditions, prompted households to increase savings. As a result of adjustment in the private sector, the external financing requirement declined markedly. In the Council's judgement, the series of inflation shocks potentially resulting in an increase in economic agents' longer-term inflation expectations poses the greatest risk to the longer-term outlook for inflation. However, domestic demand has fallen to an extent that, apart from the effects of the tax changes, a low inflation environment can be expected even taking into account that risk. After improving significantly in previous months, international investor sentiment and assessments of risks associated with the Hungarian economy have not changed materially over the past month. The substantial decline in the external financing requirement and the resumption of government borrowing directly from the bond market also contributed to an easing of concerns about the country's external financing. The Monetary Council decided to reduce the central bank base rate after considering the recent developments in the economy and inflation and in assessments of risks. Monetary policy may be eased further if it does not pose a threat to the inflation outlook and if assessments of risk allow it."
Israel,2009-08-24,"24.8.2009</td> The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for September 2009 by a quarterof a percentage point The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for September 2009 will increase by 0.25 percentage points to 0.75 percent. (Please note: the interest rate for October 2009 will be published at 17:30 p.m. on Thursday 24 September 2009.) Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 1.1 percent in July, exceeding the forecasters' expectations of an increase of 0.8 percent to 0.9 percent. Excluding the effects of the changes in tax rates andgovernment-supervised prices, however, the July increase in the CPI was about 0.5 percent. Continuing the trend that started in April, prices rose inmost of the components of the index. Since the beginning of the year the CPI has increased by 3.2 percent, and measured over the previous twelve months, by 3.5 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: At the beginning of Augustforecasters' inflation expectations twelve months forward and expectations derived from the capital market increased to around the upper limitof the target inflation range, but following the publication of the July CPI they declined sharply, and reached close to the midpoint of the range. Thus, last week the forecasters' twelve-month forward inflation expectationsaveraged 2.3 percent, and expectations calculated from the capital market were 2.2 percent. The averages of forecasters' inflation expectations are for an increase of 0.6 percent in August and for a decline of 0.2 percent inSeptember. According to these forecasts, inflation over the previous twelve months is expected to remain around the upper limit of the target range in the next few months. Forecasters' and capital market expectations of the Bank of Israel interest rate for September ranged from no change in the rate to an increase of a quarter of a percentage point; the average of the forecasters' expectations of the interest rate a year hence is 2.1 percent, and expectations derived from the capital market average 2.5 percent. Real economic activity: The latest data available indicate that the decline in activity has halted, and that there has been a shift towards an upward trend, albeit a moderate one. National Accounts data for the second quarter show some increase in GDP, with growth in exports and private and public consumption. GDP increased in the second quarter at an annual rateof 1 percent, after declining in the first quarter at a rate of 3.7 percent; goods and services exports increased at a rate of 5.8 percent, and private consumption at a rate of 4.4 percent. The July composite index of the state of the economy increased by 1.2 percent, and the indices for the previous three months were all revised upwards. The increase in the index was the result of increases in all its components, and in particular in the index of manufacturing production and of trade and services revenue. The labor market and wages: The Ministry of Industry. Trade and Labor employers survey shows that the decline in the demand for workers continued in the second quarter, but at more moderate rate than in the previousquarters. Employment Service data indicate a downward trend since April in the number of new jobseekers, and a reduction in the number of dismissals.However, the rate of unemployment, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics trend data, continued to increase in May, and reached 8.4 percent. The real wage in the three months March-May was 3.4 percent lower than that in March-May 2008, and the nominal wage was 0.3 percent lower. Budget data: In January-July 2009 the budget deficit (excluding credit) totaled NIS 17.3 billion, in contrast to budget surpluses in those months in previous years. The large deficit in domestic activity reflects the steep drop in tax revenues that started in the middle of 2008. In July indirect tax revenues increased for the first time this year, and the government had an overall budget surplus of NIS 0.4 billion, excluding credit. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the monetary policy discussions of 26 July and 21 August, the shekel strengthened by 1.3 percent against the dollar, and by 0.7 percent against the euro. In terms of the index of the effective exchange rate vis-?-vis the currencies of Israel's trading partners (weighted by the volume of trade), the shekel strengthened by 1 percent. The strengthening of the shekel was supported by the positive indicators relating to Israel's economy published during the month, and by the July CPI, which exceeded expectations. The Bank of Israel's announcement about the change in its intervention policy in the foreign exchange market and the ending of its regular daily purchases of foreign currency also contributed to the strengthening of the shekel. The capital and money markets: Between 26 July and 21 August the Tel Aviv 25 share price index and the Tel Aviv 100 index rose by about 3.6 percent and 4.2 percent respectively. Most leading share price indices around the world also showed upward trends. The yield curve of government bondsflattened, with 10-year bonds remaining stable, and yields on 2-year to 5-year bonds increasing: yields on unindexed government bonds increased by 30 basis points, and those on indexed government bonds increased by 10-50 basis points. The yield gap between 10-year unindexed Israeli government bonds and US government bonds stayed almost unchanged, at 1.73 percentage points. In the corporate bond market too, prices increased and yields fell. The Tel-Bond 20 index increased by 2.1 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 3.8 percent. At the beginning of August the Bank of Israel ended the program it started in March 2009 of purchasing government bonds on the secondary market, having bought a total of NIS 18 billion of those bonds, in line with the program. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, declined from 1.31 percentage points to 1.15 percentagepoints this month. The CDS spreads of other countries also contracted. The money supply: In the last twelve months the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) has grown by 56.1 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits up to one year) by 20.5 percent. The steep increase in M 1 was due mainly to the public's switchingfrom time deposits to current accounts in light of the low level of interest on the deposits that are included in M 2. The world economy: Economic data published during the last month strengthened the assessment of economic organizations and institutions thatactivity was starting to stabilize, and that a moderate recovery was expected to start, although at this stage the degree and length of the recovery were unclear. During most of the last month the atmosphere in the financialmarkets remained positive. In the first half of the month stock exchanges continued to rise, but in the last two weeks there was increased concern over the stability of the economic recovery, especially in China, and againstthat background the markets fell. Central banks and governments around theworld are expected to persist with their expansionary policies, and to start removing their support only gradually. Despite the increase in commodityprices since the end of February, and particularly the increase in energy prices, investment houses on average expect a marked reduction in global inflation in 2009, to 1.6 percent. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to increase the interest rate for September by a quarter ofa percentage point to 0.75 percent will help return inflation to within the target range and will strengthen the economy's ability to establish a firm base for the recovery in economic activity, while supporting financial stability. The main considerations behind the decisions are: In the lastfew months, inflation measured over the previous twelve months was above the target range of price stability. A considerable part of the deviation was the result of non-recurring factors (increased tax rates, including VAT, and water prices), but even excluding these elements, inflation was close to the upper limit of the target range. Twelve-months-forward inflation expectations, both those of forecasters and those derived from the capital market, have fallen to around the midpoint of the target range. Nevertheless, it is thought that the reduction in twelve-month inflation expectations is due not only to the continued widening of the output gap, but also to expectations that the Bank of Israel will increase the interest rate in the next few months. The most recent data on real activity in Israel strengthen the assessment that there has been a turnaround, although there is great uncertainty regarding the expected rate of growth. Interest rates of the leading central banks around the world are expected to remain unchanged till the end of the year, and possibly even to the middle of 2010. However, unlike in Israel, inflation in those countries is expected to remain low both this year and next. In this situation, the Bank of Israel's decision to increase the interest rate for September by a quarter of a percentage point strikes a balance between the need to moderate inflation and the need to continue to support the recent recovery in economic activity, given that unemployment is expected to continue increasing in the next few months. Setting the interest rate at the low level of 0.75 percent continues to represent an expansionary monetary policy. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments, and will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives--price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decisionwill be published on 7 September 2009. The decision regarding the interest rate for October 2009 will be published at 17:30 on Thursday, 24 September 2009. 24.8.2009</td> The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for September 2009 by a quarterof a percentage point.

Malaysia,2009-08-25,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 2.00 percent. Since the MPC in July, more signs have emerged to suggest that global economic and financial conditions are improving. Economic activity in some advanced and regional countries has begun to gradually recover in response to the significant fiscal and monetary measures that have been implemented. Economic recovery, however, will likely be a slow process as some of these economies undergo further structural adjustments. In the domestic economy, recent financial and economic indicators, including industrial production, financing trends, consumer and business sentiment, and retrenchments, reaffirm the assessment that economic conditions are stabilising. Going forward, the expectation remains that the domestic economy will improve in the second half of 2009 and into 2010, following a recovery in domestic demand amidst stabilisation of the global economy. Inflation declined further in July. As in the previous month, the decline largely reflects the cumulative fall in fuel prices since June 2008, and the easing pressure on food prices. The negative inflation is expected to be temporary and is projected to turn positive as domestic conditions strengthen. With improving domestic economic conditions and as price pressures are expected to remain benign going forward, the assessment is that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate and will continue to provide support for economic activity.

Poland,2009-08-26,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 26 August 2009 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 25-26 August 2009 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate at 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 3.75% on an annual basis. The recently released data  including those on GDP in 2009 Q2  indicate easing of recessionary tendencies in the United States and in most EU countries. At the same time, most economic sentiment indicators have improved further and the forecasts of GDP growth in 2010 for the United States and the euro area have been slightly revised upwards. The global economic activity, however, is still low and it is currently difficult to assess how permanent the easing of the recession will be, especially given the persistent problems in the financial sector. In major economies the decline in the general price level, which results from the slowdown in the world economic growth and the previously observed drop in commodity prices, has deepened. At the same time, core inflation have continued to decrease. In turn, the prices of energy commodities in the world markets have begun to rise again. In the recent period the economic activity in Poland remained subdued, as indicated by the continuing decline in industrial output. At the same time, some acceleration in retail sales and a rise in the majority of economic sentiment indicators signal improvement of the economic situation in the months to come. Labour market has further deteriorated: the fall in employment in the corporate sector has deepened and the unemployment rate has risen. This was accompanied by a slightly higher than expected increase of wages in the corporate sector. Reduced lending, in particular to the corporate sector, continues to be a factor curbing economic growth. In July 2009 the annual CPI inflation rose to 3.6%, i.e. above the NBP inflation target of 2.5% and also slightly above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. The rise in inflation was primarily driven by strongly rising prices of tobacco resulting from changes in the excise tax and by a further increase in fuel prices. Inflation remaining at the heightened level results, to a large extent, from the previous rises of regulated prices and an earlier depreciation of zloty exchange rate. The relatively high level of core inflation indicates that the scale of demand weakening so far failed to fully offset the effect of increases in regulated prices and an earlier depreciation of the exchange rate. In the Council's assessment, inflation is likely to remain at an elevated level in the coming months, mainly due to the relatively high annual growth of food prices and regulated prices, including, above all, the prices of energy. The recently observed rise in crude oil prices, mitigated to a certain ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, extent by the recent zloty appreciation, may also be conducive to inflation remaining at an increased level. In the medium term, however, low demand pressure and a slower growth of labour costs should be conducive to inflation decrease. In the Council's assessment, the probability of inflation running below the inflation target in the medium term is higher than the probability of its running above the target. In the Council's view, the expected improvement in the global economic activity and the implemented cuts in the NBP interest rates together with the lowering of the required reserve rate will support the return of the economy to the potential growth path. The Council's decisions in the coming months will take account of the incoming information on the outlook for economic growth and inflation, the situation in the financial markets in Poland and abroad, information on the public finance sector and the zloty exchange rate developments. The Council will continue to analyse the impact of developments in the domestic interbank market on the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Poland. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts required for euro adoption in Poland. As regards the ongoing works on the Government's resolution on forming the National Coordination Committee on Euro Adoption, the Coordination Council and Inter-institutional Working Groups on Preparations for Euro Adoption by the Republic of Poland, the Monetary Policy Council adopted its stance on the role of the NBP in the process of Poland's accession to the euro area."
Thailand,2009-08-26,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 26 August 2009 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Assistant Governor. Bank of Thailand, announces the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, as follows. The latest data indicate that global economic and financial conditions have improved somewhat since the last MPC meeting. In the second quarter. GDP growth of major industrialized and most Asian economies has improved over the previous quarter. Nevertheless the MPC views that there is still a high degree of uncertainty about the sustainability of global economic recovery. In the second quarter. Thailand's economic condition has shown a more positive sign. GDP has contracted at a smaller pace compared to the same period last year but has expanded from the previous quarter. Latest economic indicators, such as manufacturing production, exports, employment and private consumption have also shown continued improvement. The MPC assesses that the current level of policy interest rate is appropriate and supportive of the economic recovery without generating any inflationary pressure. Thus the MPC decided to maintain the policy interest rate at 125 per cent per annum."
Nigeria,2009-09-01,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 65 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. September 01, 2009 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to address the challenges faced by the Nigerian economy against the backdrop of recent domestic and international economic and financial developments. External Environment The Committee noted at the outset that recessionary conditions in many developed economies seem to be abating. However there still exists considerable uncertainty as to when economic recovery would set in on a sustained basis. In recent weeks, there has been some improvement in the price of crude oil in international markets. While this development augurs well for Nigeria's fiscal and external sector positions, its sustainability would, however, depend on how quickly the global economy would bottom out of the current recession. Inflation rates have so far been very low in developed countries, making it possible for central banks to maintain record low levels of interest rates. However unemployment rates continue to be high and the financial system is still not adequately capitalized. Other emerging countries too have recorded economic slowdown and relatively low inflation. They are, however, recovering at an improved rate and their financial and foreign exchange markets have been functioning well. Key Domestic Developments Output The latest estimates of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) for 2008 and 2009 show a moderation in the rates of real GDP growth. The revised growth rate for 2008 is put at 599 per cent as against an earlier estimate of 641 per cent. For 2009, the NBS has projected growth at 533 per cent compared with an earlier projection of 575 per cent. In the first quarter of 2009, growth was in the order of 450 per cent compared with 464 per cent in the first quarter of 2008. In the second quarter of 2009, however, output growth is estimated at a higher level 1 of 673 per cent compared with 565 per cent in the second quarter of 2008. This was largely due to the contributions of agriculture, wholesale and retail trade and a growth in the relative contribution of crude petroleum and natural gas production from -172 to 057 percentage point. Against this background, the Committee noted the increased agricultural output and the expected improvement in the output of crude petroleum and natural gas will augur well for dampening inflation expectations. Inflation The Committee noted that the headline (year-on-year) inflation has been stable at a little over 11 per cent as at July 2009. The average rates of headline inflation and food inflation in the first seven months of 2009 were respectively 1311 per cent (1153 per cent in 2008) and 1594 per cent (1598 per cent in 2008). Given the outlook on output and limited aggregate demand, the staff assessment is that at the end of the year, the headline inflation would moderate further. However should there be any reversal in the movement of inflation, appropriate policies would be adopted at the next MPC meeting. The main risk to inflation comes from core inflation with higher oil prices and possible removal of subsidies combining with the usual growth of spending around the Christmas festive season. Monetary Developments Provisional data for broad money (M2) for July 2009 showed a growth of 102 per cent on a year-on-year basis, the lowest for any month since February 2006. This largely reflected the decline in net foreign assets (NFA) and sharp deceleration in the growth of credit to private sector. The Committee noted that recent improvements in oil output and prices would help to improve the gross foreign exchange reserves of the economy. However it underscored the importance of continuing with the efforts at improving the macroeconomic climate for attracting foreign capital inflows and spurring growth of private credit for productive purposes. Interest Rates and Financial Markets With the reduction of the Monetary Policy Rate and the introduction of the interest rate corridor as well as Central Bank's guarantees of unsecured inter-bank market transactions which were firmly set, effective July 20, there has been considerable improvement in the risk perceptions of market participants. The spread between the unsecured call rate and the secured open buy-back (OBB) rate has since then come down significantly and averaged 430 basis points compared with the average spread of 1384 basis points between July 1 and July 17 and the average spread of 1115 basis points in June 2009. The coupon rates on dated government securities in the primary market have tended to move downwards. The overnight inter bank rate was 411 per cent as at 28th August, 2009. In general, this implied a massive reduction in the interbank rates since the last MPC meeting. However the translation of this reduction into rates on purchased funds and lending rates seems to be delayed. Both rates are being monitored on an on-going basis. Exchange Rates and Foreign Exchange Reserves The foreign exchange market has in general been relatively stable with the re-introduction of the wholesale Dutch auction system and the measures taken to further liberalize the inter-bank market since the last meeting of the MPC. There has also been reduction in exchange rate volatility. The spread between the rates at which the auctions had been settled and the rates quoted by BDCs has narrowed from about 12 per cent to 44 per cent. In the view of this, the spread would narrow further once the confidence in the international foreign exchange markets is fully restored with the bottoming out of the current global recession, and more BDCs are being brought into the market. Foreign exchange reserves as at August 28, 2009 stood at US $41597 billion. The Committee believes that the recent improvement in the output of oil and the price of crude oil in international markets should help improve the external reserves position towards the end of the year. Perspectives and the Stance of Policy Against the backdrop of signs of gradual improvement in the external economic environment and the positive outlook for the domestic economy, the Committee felt that policy initiatives are needed to further improve growth without jeopardising price and financial stability. It will, therefore, continue to manage liquidity actively to ensure that credit requirements are taken care of at reasonable interest rates while monitoring the trends in prices. The Committee will also pursue an interest rate policy that is consistent with price and financial stability and supportive of enhancing the levels of economic activity on a higher trajectory. On foreign exchange, the policy stance remains that exchange rate should be principally market driven, but interventions will be made to mitigate tendencies towards volatility and to counteract speculative attacks on the national currency. Decisions In the light of the above, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to: a) keep the MPR unchanged at 6 per cent per annum; b) maintain the interest rate corridor at +/- 2 per cent around the MPR; and c) Approve in principle the establishment of an “Asset Purchase Facility Fund”.

Euroarea,2009-09-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates remain appropriate, taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our last meeting on 6 August 2009. In this respect, at today's meeting we also decided that the rate for the twelve-month longer-term refinancing operation to be allotted on 30 September 2009 will be the prevailing rate on the main refinancing operations. This decision, which continues to guarantee liquidity support to the banking system of the euro area for an extended period of time at very favourable conditions, should promote the extension of credit to the euro area economy and, therefore, further underpin its recovery. Price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. Annual HICP inflation was slightly negative in August according to Eurostat's flash estimate. This reflects mainly the base effects of the strong rise in commodity prices in 2008. The return of HICP inflation to moderate positive rates is expected within the coming months. At the same time, the latest information supports our view that there are increasing signs of stabilisation in economic activity in the euro area and elsewhere. This is consistent with the expectation that the significant contraction in economic activity has come to an end and is now followed by a period of stabilisation and very gradual recovery. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. Let me now explain our assessment in further detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following the strong negative growth rates observed around the turn of the year, according to Eurostat's first estimate, economic activity in the euro area declined only slightly in the second quarter of 2009, contracting by 0.1% compared with the previous quarter. Survey indicators for the third quarter of 2009 support the view that the euro area economy is stabilising further. In the near term, the euro area should continue to benefit from a recovery in exports, the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures taken so far to restore the functioning of the financial system. In addition, the inventory cycle is expected to contribute positively. However, uncertainty remains high and the persistent volatility in incoming data warrants a cautious interpretation of available information. Overall, the recovery is expected to be rather uneven, given the temporary nature of some of the supporting factors and the ongoing balance sheet correction in the financial and non-financial sectors of the economy, both inside and outside the euro area. This assessment is broadly in line with the September 2009 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. According to these projections, average annual real GDP growth will range between -4.4% and -3.8% in 2009 and between -0.5% and +0.9% in 2010. Compared with the June 2009 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, this implies an upward revision of the ranges for both 2009 and 2010, reflecting mainly the recent, more positive developments and information. Forecasts by international organisations are broadly in line with the September 2009 ECB staff projections. In the view of the Governing Council, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. On the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve more quickly, labour market deterioration may be less marked than currently expected and foreign demand may prove to be stronger than projected. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the still strained financial markets, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and a disorderly correction of global imbalances. At the same time, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook remains higher than usual. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation was, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, -0.2% in August , compared with -0.7% in July. This development is in line with previous expectations and reflects largely base effects resulting from the movements in global commodity prices a year ago. Owing to these base effects, annual inflation rates are projected to turn positive again within the coming months. Looking further ahead, inflation is expected to remain in positive territory, with overall price and cost developments staying subdued in the wake of ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. In this context, it is important to re-emphasise that the indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This outlook is consistent with the September 2009 ECB staff projections for euro area inflation. In these projections, annual HICP inflation is projected to range between 0.2% and 0.6% in 2009 and between 0.8% and 1.6% in 2010, revised slightly upwards from the June 2009 Eurosystem staff projections, reflecting mainly upward revisions to energy prices. Available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture. Risks to the outlook for price developments remain broadly balanced. They relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and to higher than expected commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm a continued deceleration in both broad money and credit growth. In July, the annual growth rates of M3 and loans to the private sector declined further to 3.0% and 0.6% respectively, reaching new lows since 1999. These developments support the assessment of a slower underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. The short-term developments of M3 and its components have remained volatile. The recent changes in interest rates paid on the different instruments included in M3 have continued to underlie the strong shifts in the allocation of funds from, in particular, short-term time deposits to overnight deposits. The deceleration in annual M3 growth has thus continued to combine with a substantial further strengthening of annual M1 growth, which in July rose to 12.1%. In addition, the relatively steep yield curve and the re-emergence of risk appetite, reflected particularly in the increase in stock prices over the past few months, may have dampened M3 growth to some extent. The overall flow of bank loans to the non-financial private sector remained subdued in July, with the differences across borrowing sectors becoming more marked. The flow of loans to households remained slightly positive, whereas in the case of non-financial corporations the flow of loans was negative again. The decline in loans to non-financial corporations continues to reflect mainly a strong net redemption of loans with a shorter maturity, while lending and borrowing at longer maturities remained positive. The fall in production and trade and the ongoing uncertainty in the business outlook are likely to have dampened firms' demand for financing. Given the normal lag between a recovery in economic activity and a pick-up in loans to enterprises, further weak developments in loans to non-financial corporations in the coming months appear likely. At the same time, a gradual improvement in financing conditions, as lower market interest rates continue to be passed on in lower bank lending rates, should support the demand for credit in the period ahead. Against the background of highly demanding challenges, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector, particularly as regards recapitalisation. To sum up, the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 6 August 2009 confirms the view of the Governing Council that the current key ECB interest rates remain appropriate. In this respect, at today's meeting we also decided that the rate for the twelve-month longer-term refinancing operation to be allotted on 30 September 2009 will be the prevailing rate on the main refinancing operations. Price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. This reflects mainly the base effects of the strong rise in commodity prices in 2008. The return of HICP inflation to moderate positive rates is expected within the coming months. At the same time, the latest information supports our view that there are increasing signs of stabilisation in economic activity in the euro area and elsewhere. This is consistent with the expectation that the significant contraction in economic activity has come to an end and is now followed by a period of stabilisation and very gradual recovery. Available indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit expansion continues to decelerate. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby continuing to support the purchasing power of euro area households. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, we expect that our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full. Hence, with all the measures taken, monetary policy is providing ongoing support for households and corporations. Once the macroeconomic environment improves, the Governing Council will make sure that the measures taken are unwound in a timely fashion and that the liquidity provided is absorbed in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term. By so doing, the Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, the latest quarterly euro area data and developments in individual countries confirm a substantial deterioration of fiscal positions in 2009, which is projected to continue in 2010. In finalising their 2010 budgets and medium-term fiscal plans, governments must now substantiate their commitment to ensuring a swift return to sound and sustainable public finances in line with the Stability and Growth Pact. In particular, it is crucial that ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies, underpinned by concrete structural measures, are put in place. The structural adjustment process should start, in any case, not later than the economic recovery and the consolidation efforts should be stepped up in 2011. Structural consolidation efforts will need to exceed significantly the benchmark of 0.5% of GDP per annum set in the Stability and Growth Pact. In countries with high deficits and/or debt ratios, the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1% of GDP. The focus of the structural measures should lie on the expenditure side, as in most euro area countries tax and social contribution rates are already high. Turning to structural policies, it is likely that the financial crisis will affect the growth potential in the euro area. This outlook reinforces the need to strengthen reform efforts to support sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. It requires, in particular, appropriate wage-setting, sufficient labour market flexibility and effective incentives to work. At the same time, policies that enhance competition and innovation are urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create the business opportunities and productivity gains needed to ensure a sustained recovery. In this respect, an appropriate restructuring and consolidation of the banking sector plays an important role. Sound balance sheets, solid risk management, and transparent and robust business models are key to strengthening the financial soundness of banks and their resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and financial stability."
Chile,2009-09-08,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 8 September 2009 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50% (annual), and to continue applying the complementary monetary policy measures adopted in July's meeting. Internationally, recent data show stabilizing global growth prospects for this year. These prospects have resulted in a better environment in financial markets. Commodity prices, particularly for copper, have remained stable. Domestically, available information suggests that output and demand have expanded in recent months, but are still below the levels of a year ago. The rise in unemployment has moderated and employment has tended to stabilize. Lending conditions remain tight, despite reduced lending interest rates. In August. CPI inflation was affected by a temporary reduction in electricity tariffs. Wage dynamics continue to be in line with historical patterns. Reduced y- o-y inflation figures are foreseen for the coming quarters. Medium-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The Board reiterates that the monetary policy rate will be held at its minimum level of 0.50% for a prolonged time period, and that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected annual inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2009-09-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. Domestic economic activity is sustaining its improved trend thanks to the progress of global economic situation. Domestic demand and exports have staged a recovery and production has increased. There still remains, however, uncertainty as to the economic growth path. Consumer price inflation has moved somewhat higher, but it seems likely to remain at a generally stable level. The upward trend of real estate prices has been maintained. Market interest rates and stock prices have risen. Mortgage loans continued their large-scale expansion. Meanwhile, concerns about credit risk and the shortermism of market funds seem to have moderated to some degree. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain accommodative policy stance for the time being and do what is needed to bring about the continuation of the recent improving pattern of economic movements and financial market stabilization."
Peru,2009-09-10,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2009 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 1.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference interest rate at 1.25 percent. This decision to maintain the monetary stimulus unchanged is based on the sustained reduction of annual inflation inflation has declined from 6.65 percent in December to 1.87 percent in August and on the continuous reduction of inflation expectations. Inflation in August showed a rate of -0.21 percent, as a result of which annual inflation declined for the ninth consecutive month, falling within the target range. Inflation is expected to continue declining in the next months, showing rates close to the lower band of the target range. Unless important changes were observed in inflation forecasts and in inflation determinants, no new adjustments are foreseen in the reference rate. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 2.05 percent. Overnight deposits: 0.45 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.05 percent. The interests on reserve requirements in foreign currency corresponding to additional reserve requirements, provided that they are deposited at this Central Bank, will be equivalent to 60 percent of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR rate). The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the next month on its session of October 7, 2009."
Georgia,2009-09-16,"16.09.2009 The NBG Keeps its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) unchanged at 6 Percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on September 16, 2009 and decided to keep its main policy rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 6 percent. The annual rate of inflation was -3.1 percent in August and the average annual inflation stands at 3.3 percent. The sharp decrease in inflation is attributed to the base effect. In particular, as a consequence of Russian aggression against Georgia food prices increased temporarily last August, but in the months after the conflict, prices gradually returned to their previous levels. It is expected that annual inflation will increase during the remainder of the year and will become positive by the end of the year. The year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money aggregate for August was positive for the first time since January of the current year, which points to positive trends in the economy over the last several months. As was noted during the last MPC meeting, interest rates were expected to decrease. Already in September, a drop in interest rates has been observed. For the first time since 2005 at today's auction at the NBG one-year maturity Treasury Bills were sold , which practically created one-year yield curve. The yield curve will act as benchmark for the interest rates of Lari-denominated assets and will aid in the development of the securities market. The depreciation of the real effective exchange rate over the last year contributed to the decrease in imports and encouraged domestic economic activity, subsequently leading to narrowing of the current account deficit. An increasing number of countries are reporting about the beginning of recovery, although speeds of rebound are different across the board. Observations by international market participants that Euro zone economies are returning to growth created expectation of monetary policy rate increases which contributed to the recent appreciation of the Euro. The National Bank of Georgia will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on October 14, 2009."
Egypt,2009-09-17,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release September 17, 2009 In its meeting held on September 17, 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut its overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate by 25 bps to 825 percent and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was unchange. Annual headline CPI inflation continued to decline reaching a 20-month low of 9 percent in August 2009, compared to 99 percent in July, down from the 236 percent peak recorded in August 200. Volatile food items, namely fruits and vegetables, continued to be the determining factor in the overall inflation outtur. While the unfavorable developments in the prices of volatile food items have flattened the disinflation path, they do not characterize the underlying inflationary pressure. Inflation excluding fruits and vegetables accumulated in the first eight months of 2009 reached 42 percent compared to the 144 percent accumulated during the same period in 2008, reflecting the evident change in the inflation dynamic. Nonetheless while underlying inflation is expected to remain within the CBE's comfort zone in the period ahead, annual headline inflation is likely to inch up over the coming months mainly owing to base effects from last yea. This development has already been factored into the CBE's assessment of the monetary policy stanc. In the meantime, annual real GDP growth in 2008/09 recorded 47 percen. This outturn has been better than previously expected at the outset of the global financial crisis yet remains below the 7 percent average registered over the past three year. There are encouraging signs that the global slowdown has stabilized somewhat over recent months and the outlook for the international economy appears to have improved as wel. This coupled, with the domestic fiscal and monetary measures undertaken so far will help provide a conducive environment for the domestic econom. Against this background, the MPC assesses that the current level of policy interest rate is appropriate and supportive of the economic recovery while consistent with maintaining underlying inflation within the CBE's comfort zon. The MPC will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global economic turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objectiv.

Turkiye,2009-09-17,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 7.75 percent to 7.25 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 10.25 percent to 9.75 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. is decreased from 3.75 percent to 3.25 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 13.25 percent to 12.75 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 9.25 percent to 8.75 percent. Recent data releases indicate that, in line with the Committee's previous assessments, the ongoing recovery in economic activity will be gradual and protracted. External demand and domestic investment demand remain weak, while labor market conditions do not display a significant improvement. Moreover, consumption demand, after having increased markedly during the second quarter, is expected to display a weaker course in the third quarter. Therefore, in line with the perspective outlined in the Inflation Report, inflation is expected to remain at low levels for a long period of time. The Committee expects that the cumulative policy rate cuts implemented since November 2008, provided that the improvements in global risk perceptions persist, would start to have some effect on credit markets in the forthcoming period. However, the weakness in labor markets is ongoing and lingering problems across the global economy are not resolved completely, suggesting that there are still uncertainties regarding the strength of the recovery. Therefore, the Committee reiterates that it will be necessary for the monetary policy to maintain an easing bias for a long period of time. The size and the duration of the rate cuts will depend on the pace of the recovery in economic activity. Moreover, further improvements in the risk premium may lead to a longer rate cut cycle. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
South Africa,2009-09-22,"2.1 The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas declined to 6,4 per cent in August, compared with 6,7 per cent in July. The main contributors to the inflation outcome were the categories of housing and utilities, and miscellaneous goods and services. Food price inflation moderated further, with food and alcoholic beverages increasing at a year-on-year rate of 6,8 per cent, down from 8,3 per cent in July. 2.2 Producer prices have continued their negative trend and declined at a year-on-year rate of 3,8 per cent in July, compared with a decline of 4,1 per cent in June. Food price inflation at the consumer level can be expected to abate as agricultural product prices declined at a year-on-year rate of 1,7 per cent while manufactured food product prices increased at a rate of 0,8 per cent. Upside pressure on producer prices came from electricity prices which increased by 27,4 per cent. 3.1 The CPI inflation forecast by the South African Reserve Bank staff continues to indicate that inflation is likely to return on a sustained basis to within the inflation target range by the second quarter of 2010. CPI inflation is then expected to remain within the inflation target range for the remainder of the forecast period until the end of 2011. Compared with the previous forecast, the outlook is unchanged for 2009 and 2010, although there is a slight improvement for 2011. The exchange rate of the rand has provided downside pressure which has more or less offset higher oil price assumptions and higher unit labour costs over the period. 3.2 The most recent study of inflation expectations undertaken on behalf of the Bank by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University, indicates that inflation expectations have improved somewhat but remain on average above the upper end of the inflation target range. Inflation is expected to average 7,5 per cent in both 2010 and 2011. This represents declines of 0,6 per cent and 0,4 per cent in these years respectively, compared with the previous survey. Only the financial analysts expect inflation to be within the target range in the coming two years. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the break-even inflation rates, as measured by the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation-linked bonds, declined across all maturities to within the inflation target range. 3.3 Overall the risks to the inflation outlook appear to be fairly evenly balanced. The main upside risks continue to emanate from high increases in some administered prices, particularly electricity prices, and increases in nominal unit labour costs well in excess of the current inflation rate. Nominal unit labour cost increased over four quarters by 9,3 per cent in the second quarter of 2009, compared with 11,3 per cent in the previous quarter. 3.4 International oil prices, which remain an upside inflation risk factor, have moderated slightly since the previous meeting of the MPC and appear to have stabilised around current levels of about US$70 per barrel. Domestic petrol prices increased by 36 cents per litre in September, but the current over-recovery indicates that this increase may be offset to a large extent in October, as a result of lower product prices and the recent appreciation of the rand. 3.5 Growth in domestic final demand declined at an annualised rate of 3,5 per cent in the second quarter of 2009. Household consumption expenditure contracted by 5,8 per cent, compared with a decline of 4,8 per cent in the previous quarter. Durable goods consumption was the most affected sub-category, declining by 18,8 per cent. New vehicle sales declined at a year-on-year rate of 23 percent in August, but there are signs that the decline is leveling out. In July, real retail and wholesale trade sales contracted at year-on-year rates of 3,8 per cent and 13,8 per cent respectively, although retail sales increased on a month-on-month basis. 3.6 Consumption expenditure is expected to remain constrained by negative wealth effects, although there has been a marked recovery in the equity markets which may relieve these effects somewhat. Since the beginning of the year, the all-share index on the JSE Limited has increased by about 20 per cent. House prices, however, have continued their downward trend. The various house price indices, while still indicating negative price trends, show that prices are declining at a slower rate. 3.7 Credit extension to the private sector continued to reflect both the weak household consumption expenditure and the prevailing tighter credit criteria. Twelve-month growth in banks' total loans and advances declined to 2,1 per cent in July. Mortgage advances declined to a year-on-year rate of growth of 6,4 per cent in July, while instalment sale credit and leasing finance contracted by 3,2 per cent over the same period, as a result of subdued demand for motor vehicles and other durable goods. Other loans and advances, comprising credit card advances, bank overdrafts and general loans declined by 2,0 per cent. Lower levels of credit extension have resulted in a slight decline in household debt as a percentage of household disposable income to 76,3 per cent in the second quarter of 2009. The ratio of debt service cost to household disposable income declined from 10,9 per cent in the first quarter to 9,5 per cent in the second quarter. 3.8 Domestic output contracted by 3,0 per cent in the second quarter of 2009, but there are early indications that the lower turning point may have been reached. However the recovery is expected to be slow. The South African Reserve Bank composite leading indicator increased for the third consecutive month in June and continues to predict a recovery by the end of the year. 3.9 The rate of contraction in the manufacturing sector also shows signs of slowing down. On a year-on-year basis, manufacturing output declined by 13,7 per cent in July, but it increased at an annualised month-on-month rate of 3,0 per cent. The Kagiso/BER Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) increased in July, although still at levels that indicate negative growth. Mining production increased at a year-on-year rate of 4,8 per cent in July. However the real value of all building plans passed declined by 43,2 per cent in July, with the slowdown in residential building plans being the main contributor. 3.10 The exchange rate of the rand continues to provide downside pressure on inflation and has appreciated further since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee when it was at a level of around R8,10 to the US dollar. Since the beginning of the year, the rand has appreciated by 26 per cent against the US dollar, and by 20 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. 3.11 The global economy appears to be recovering in response to concerted fiscal and monetary packages which have been put in place. A number of industrialised economies have experienced positive growth rates in the second quarter, while others have shown a moderation in the rate of contraction. Many forecasts for the second half of the year and for 2010 have been revised upward, but remain well below pre-crisis levels. However, there are risks that the recovery may be short-lived should consumer demand not improve further in the industrialised economies. Whilst there have been some improvements in financial market conditions, more still remains to be done. Global inflation remains relatively subdued and poses no immediate risk to the domestic inflation outlook. 4.1 The Monetary Policy Committee is of the view that the risks to the inflation outlook appear to be fairly evenly balanced. Given the current policy stance, inflation is expected to continue moderating and return to within the inflation target range during the forecast period. Accordingly, the MPC has decided to leave the repurchase rate unchanged at 7 per cent per annum."
United States,2009-09-23,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn. Conditions in financial markets have improved further, and activity in the housing sector has increased. Household spending seems to be stabilizing, but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability. With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of $1.25trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt. The Committee will gradually slow the pace of these purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets and anticipates that they will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010. As previously announced, the Federal Reserve's purchases of $300billion of Treasury securities will be completed by the end of October 2009. The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Charles L Evans; Donald L Kohn; Jeffrey M Lacker; Dennis P Lockhart; Daniel K Tarullo; Kevin M Warsh; and Janet L Yellen."
Israel,2009-09-24,"24.9.2009</td> The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for October 2009 unchanged The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for October 2009 will be unchanged at 0.75 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.5 percent in August, in line with the forecasters' expectations. Over the last twelve months the CPI has increased by 3.1 percent, and since the beginning of the year by 3.7 percent. Excluding the effects of seasonality and the priceincreases resulting from changes in tax rates (the increase in tax on cigarettes and fuel. VAT, and the water surcharge), the rate of inflation sincethe beginning of the year has been around the midpoint of the inflation target range. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation expectations, which fell below the midpoint of the inflation target range at the end of August, rose again at the beginning of September, and the average of expectations for the next twelve months--both of forecasters and those derived from the capital market--is 2.3 percent. The average of forecasters' inflation expectations for September is for a decline of a tenth of a percentage point, and for October, for an increase of two tenths of a percentage point. According to these forecasts, inflation measured over the previous twelve months is expected to remain around theupper limit of the target range in the next two months. Expectations of the Bank of Israel interest rate derived from the capital market are for a rising trend in the next few months, with the interest rate a year hence at 2.4 percent. Forecasters' expectations of the interest rate are on average for an increase of 0.1 percentage points in the rate for October, and for a rate of 2.8 percent in a year's time. Real economic activity: The latest available data indicate that the recovery in activity has continued. At the end of August the Bank of Israel revised its forecasts of growth in 2009 and 2010 upwards: it changed its forecast for 2009 from a reduction of 1.5 percent in GDP to one of stability, and it raised its previous forecast of 1 percent growth in 2010 to oneof 2.5 percent growth. The August composite index of the state of the economy increased by 1.3 percent, following increases in the index for July and also in the indices for May and June. It should be noted, however, that the rise in the index reflects mainly increases in goods and services exports, while manufacturingproduction and trade and services revenue registered declines in July. Initial findings from the Bank of Israel Companies Survey for the third quarter also indicate a recovery in activity, i.e., a positive net balance, for the first time since the second quarter of 2008. The labor market and wages: The Manpower Survey for the second quarter of 2009 shows further deterioration in the labor market in that quarter, albeit a more moderate decline than in the previous quarters. The unemployment rate increased by 0.4 percentage points, to 8 percent, a lower figure than had been anticipated. Although unemployment has increased in the current crisis, it has not risen to the levels it reached in the recession of 2001-03. The real wage in April-June 2009 was 3.6 percent lower than in April-June 2008, and the nominal wage was 0.6 percentlower than in those months in 2008. By contrast, data on Health Tax revenues in July point to an increase in total wage payments, further to the increase recorded in June. Budget data: In January-August 2009 the budget deficit (excluding credit) totaled NIS 19.4 billion, in contrast to a budget surplus of NIS 1.5 billion in those months in 2008. The forecast of the budgetdeficit in 2009 based on performance of the budget from January to August is that the deficit will be slightly below the target of 6 percent of GDP. In August direct tax revenues stabilized, following a long period of decline. Indirect tax revenues have shown a moderate upward trend since April this year. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the monetary policy discussions of 23 August and 23 September, the shekel strengthened by 2.26 percent against the dollar, and weakened by 1.1 percent against the euro. In terms of the index of the effective exchange rate vis-?-vis the currencies of Israel's trading partners (weighted by the volume of trade), theshekel strengthened by 0.46 percent. The strengthening of the shekel against the dollar was not very different from the performance of other currencies vis-?-vis the dollar, some of which strengthened by more than did the shekel. The reasons for the strengthening of the shekel include the surplus in the current account of the balance of payments and the increase last month in the Bank of Israel interest rate. The Bank's activity in the forex market served to moderate the exchange rate appreciation. The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of 23 August and 23 September, the Tel Aviv 25 and the Tel Aviv 100 indices rose by about 0.6 percent, despite the fact that announcements by companies that they were unable to repay their debts cast a shadow over the share and corporate bond markets during most of the period. Most leading share price indices around the world showed stronger increases. In the government bond market, yields dropped during most of the period, with significantreductions of between 20 and 45 basis points along the entire curve in theunindexed local-currency segment. The indexed segment followed a similar path, with drops of between 10 and 30 basis points along the whole curve, with the short part of the curve showing the greatest declines. The makam yield curve, however, showed yield increases of 15-30 basis points over the entire curve, with the yield on one year makam at about 1.7 percent. The yield gap between 10-year unindexed Israeli government bonds and US government bonds stayed almost unchanged, at 1.70 percentage points. In the corporate bond market prices fell sharply, the first decline in several months (following companies' announcements mentioned above, that they were unable to meet their debt repayments), but in the last few days prices increased again. In the period between the previous and the current interest rate discussions, the Tel-Bond 20 index increased by 1.39 percent, while the Tel-Bond 40 index dropped by 1.6 percent. This month new bond issues totaled about NIS 4 billion, and since the beginning of the year, about NIS 30 billion, compared with about NIS 22 billion in the whole of 2008. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, declined from 1.15 percentage points to 1 percentage point this month, in line with the global trend in CDS spreads. The money supply: The rate of increase in the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) over the last twelve months reached 64 percent in August, compared with 56 percent in July, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits up to one year) increased by 20 percent in the twelve months to August, similar to the rate in the twelve months to July. This reflects the continued process of adjusting the componentsof the money supply to the low interest environment. That said, it is too early to assess the effect of the increase in the interest rate last month on the development of the monetary aggregates. The world economy: One year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, there are more and more signs that the global economy is recovering from the crisis and is returning to a path of growth. This month too the positive trend that appeared in March persisted. World trade increased by 2.5 percent (monthly figure) in June, and this month the IMF revised its forecast of world growth upward. There is still concern, however, that in some sectors the crisis has not ended, particularly in the financial sector. The investment houses expect inflation of 1.5 percent in 2009 and 2.5 percent in 2010, but there is still concern regarding deflation in the US. Europe, and inparticular, in Japan. The leading central banks are continuing with their expansionary monetary policies. In summary, global financial and economic conditions are continuing to improve. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for October unchanged at 0.75 percent will help return inflation to within the target range and underpin therecovery in real activity, while supporting financial stability. The main considerations behind the decision are: Inflation measured over the previous twelve months is slightly above the target range.Inflation from the beginning of the year, however, excluding the effects of increased tax rates and seasonally adjusted, is at the midpoint of the target range. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months, both those of the forecasters and those derived from the capital market, are also at around the midpoint of the target range. The rate of inflation is expected toreturn to within the target range when the short-term effects of the increases in taxation have run their course. The appreciation of the shekel in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate in the last few months contributed to the moderation of inflation. The continued recovery in economic activity and the expectation of faster growth in Israel and world wide suggest that the current environment is one of recoveryfrom the recession. That said, the low rate of GDP growth in the last three quarters has resulted in an output gap that is reflected in a high rate of unemployment, that also serves to dampen inflationary pressures. In addition, there is uncertainty regarding the strength of the recovery in Israel,in part because of the uncertainty about the recovery in the global economy. Interest rates of the leading central banks around the world are low, and are expected to remain unchanged during the next few months. The Bank of Israel's decision to keep the interest rate for October unchanged and to continue with an expansionary monetary policy and its foreign exchange market policy strikes a balance between the need to returninflation to the target range of price stability, to continue to support the recovery in economic activity, to boost employment in light of the high unemployment rate, and to maintain financial stability. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments, and will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives--price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decisionwill be published on 12 October 2009. The decision regarding the interest rate for November 2009 will be published at 17:30 on 26 October 2009. 24.9.2009</td> The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for October 2009 unchanged. The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for October 2009 unchanged. The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for October 2009 will be unchanged at 0.75 percent. Background conditions. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.5 percent in August, in line with the forecasters' expectations. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for October unchanged at 0.75 percent will help return inflation to within the target range and underpin therecovery in real activity, while supporting financial stability. The main considerations behind the decision are:. Inflation measured over the previous twelve months is slightly above the target range.Inflation from the beginning of the year, however, excluding the effects of increased tax rates and seasonally adjusted, is at the midpoint of the target range."
Pakistan,2009-09-29,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 29th September 2009 Macroeconomic considerations and outlook that influence monetary policy decision depict mix picture. While inflation (YoY) and balance of payment position has improved, fiscal and real sector performance remains tenuous. Domestic financial markets functioned adequately but lending to the private sector has remained subdued. From forward looking perspective, expected improvement in the external current account and emerging global economic recovery augur well for Pakistan's economy. But limited progress on electricity shortages and stressed fiscal position dilute some of the optimism. Similarly inflation outlook is not completely benign yet as depicted by recent monthly trends. Under these circumstances, assessment of balance of risks continues to be somewhat uncertain. Both CPI and core inflation have declined further in August 2009, with former at 10. percent and Non food Non energy (NFNE) measure of the latter at 12. percent on year-on-year basis. But the pace of decline in inflation was less than expected. The monthly increase of over. percent in CPI inflation in the first two months of FY10 is still quite high and of concern. This monthly increase coupled with administrative issues in the supply chain of food items and projected increases in electricity prices to eliminate subsidies could have bearing on the behaviour of domestic inflation in the coming months. Increase in international oil prices remains an underlying risk to inflation as well. However the likely presence of Ramadan seasonality in the CPI index, especially the food basket, and disproportionate contribution of only few items calls for caution in interpreting recent monthly inflation indicators. Similarly the effect of cost push shocks like electricity and oil on inflation may be neutralized by below capacity economic activity and slow aggregate demand. Moreover expectations of inflation are likely to remain in check while the stabilization program remains on track. While it is likely that inflation will continue its secular decline, as observed in our last communication, there are risks to watch as we go forward. Tapering aggregate demand pressures in the economy can be clearly seen in persistent and widespread decline in imports. Supported by continued strong inflow of worker's remittances, this fall in import growth has resulted in modest surplus of $82 million in the external current account for August 2009. Even the cumulative July-August. FY10 external current account deficit of $527 million is much lower than earlier projections. Similarly on the back of favourable revisions regarding outlook of Pakistan's economy by international rating agencies, portfolio inflows are now positive; $55 million in the first two months of FY10. This together with inflows from the IMF, both for budgetary support ($745 million) and allocation of increased Special Drawing Rights (around $1200 million), and adequate, though lower, foreign direct investments substantially improved the external financial account. Resultantly the SBP's foreign exchange reserves have increased to $10. billion as on 28th September, 2009 an improvement of $1. billion since the beginning of FY10 and is reflected in Rs123. billion increase in the Net Foreign Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Assets (NFA) during 1st July 19th September, 2009. This has helped liquidity conditions in the economy and translated into bringing stability to the foreign exchange market. This improvement in balance of payments is despite significant shortfall in non-IMF official financial inflows. Non realization or shortfall in these official inflows could pose potential problem for fiscal management, which faces significant pressure on both the expenditure and revenue side of the budget and has already posted fiscal deficit of. percent of GDP for FY09. percentage points higher than the targeted level. Provisional figure of Rs106. billion government borrowing from the SBP during 1st July 19th September. FY10 also indicate the extent of fiscal position's weakness in the current quarter. This borrowing was despite the fact that Ministry of Finance realized Rs333 billion in the six Q1-FY10 T-bill auctions while adhering to an advance auction target of Rs325 billion for the quarter. However this financing pressure along with recent uptick in market interest rates and liquidity tightness is largely cyclical and is mostly due to the month of Ramadan and Eid festival. Likely reversal of these phenomena along with the retirement of wheat financing and improvement in external flows is expected to improve the market liquidity in the coming months and flow of credit to the private sector. Sustainable recovery of real sector of the economy would not be possible without revival of business environment and availability of credit to private sector, which in turn depends on the elimination of electricity shortages among other factors. Moreover stagnant private sector investment can hurt the potential output of the economy, adversely impacting inflation persistence. However recent steps taken towards resolution of the circular debt issue could lead to the resumption of private sector credit in the coming months. In conclusion, there are some risks to inflation while the economy gradually stabilizes. Moreover uncertainty regarding the outcome of ongoing fiscal consolidation, resolution of electricity problem, and timing of official foreign inflows call for prudence at this point. Therefore there will be no change in the SBP's policy rate, which will remain at 13 percent. These issues are likely to determine SBP's policy trajectory in the coming months. Progressing further on the formation of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). Central Board of Directors of SBP has finalized the composition of this nine member committee. In addition to the Governor of the SBP. Syed Salim Raza, and Deputy Governor. Yaseen Anwar, three SBP executives Riaz Riazuddin (economic advisor). Asad Qureshi (executive director, financial markets and reserve management), and Hamza Ali Malik (director, monetary policy department) will be the internal members.

This committee will start its deliberations in November 2009. To harmonize the constitution of MPC with the legal framework of SBP and make it fully independent, amendments in the SBP Act have already been submitted for the legislative process. Until their enactment, the MPC will seek approval of its recommendations from the Board of Directors of the SBP. Page of."
Romania,2009-09-29,"In its meeting of September 29, 2009, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR will continue to closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by using its available instruments, to ensure the fulfillment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. The analysis of the latest statistical data highlights the consolidation of disinflation, with annual inflation rate falling to 4.96 percent in August from 5.06 percent in the previous month amid a sharp contraction in aggregate demand and moderate fluctuations of the leu exchange rate. The adjusted annual CORE2 inflation  calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) as well as of the prices of major items liable to excise duties, i.e. tobacco and alcohol  dropped to an annual rate of 4.5 percent in August from 4.6 percent a month before. Statistical data show a significant and persistent correction of the external deficit in the context of the fallout from the international economic and financial crisis. In the monetary area the following issues are worth to be noting: the still fast annual dynamics of government credit, the first positive monthly dynamic of credit to the private sector recorded over the last six months and a continuing trend of higher saving in the domestic economy. The monetary policy stance stayed prudent, with the NBR permanently calibrating its broad monetary conditions with a view to consolidating the convergence of inflation rate towards medium-term objectives and ensuring the conditions for a sustainable revival of lending activity. Interbank money market rates remained close to the monetary policy rate level. Meanwhile, the credit institutions' deposit and lending rates for non-bank customers fell further, with the latter posting a relatively slower decline. In light of the available data and of the assessment of recent and upcoming developments, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 8.0 percent per annum from 8.5 percent. Consequently, starting September 30, 2009, the rate on the deposit facility will be lowered to 4.0 percent per annum from 4.5 percent and the rate on the lending facility (Lombard) will be 12.0 percent per annum versus 12.5 percent. At the same time, the penalty rate for deficits of leu-denominated minimum reserve requirements will drop to 18.0 percent from 18.75 percent, starting with the October 24-November 23, 2009 maintenance period. The NBR Board also decided to ensure an adequate management of liquidity in the banking sector with a view to consolidating monetary policy transmission channels and to further correlating market interest rates with the monetary policy rate, as well as to maintain the existing level of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu-denominated and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board reaffirms that a firm and consistent implementation of the macroeconomic policy mix  monetary, fiscal and income- as well as of the structural reforms agreed under the multilateral external financing arrangement with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions is essential for achieving a further sustainable disinflation, maintaining financial stability and for a lasting and sustainable relaunch of economic activity. The NBR Board reiterates that the central bank will continue to closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by using its available instruments, to ensure the fulfillment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for November 3, 2009, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be analyzed."
Philippines,2009-09-30,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates steady at 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. The Monetary Board decision to maintain policy rates is based on its assessment that current monetary settings remain appropriate. The latest forecasts continue to indicate within-target inflation over the policy horizon. Domestic real sector activity has started to show further signs of recovery even as some soft spots remain, such as still weak investment and labor market conditions, while domestic financial market conditions have improved. The Board also noted that, since the global economic recovery is expected to be slow, caution needs to be exercised in assessing the sustainability of domestic demand in the Philippines. The Monetary Board therefore decided to maintain the current policy stimulus to help sustain economic growth in a low-inflation environment. At the same time, the Board remains firm in its commitment to promptly address risks to price stability over the policy horizon."
Poland,2009-09-30,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 30 September 2009 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 29-30 September 2009 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate at 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 3.75% on an annual basis. Recently released data point to further improvement in economic activity in the United States and in the euro area, though the activity remains low. Both economies have recorded further improvement in most economic sentiment indicators and the forecasts of GDP growth in 2010 have been slightly revised upwards. At present, it is difficult to assess the scale and sustainability of the expected recovery, especially given the persistent problems in the financial sector and gradual restraint of stimulus packages. In major economies the decline in the general price level continued  driven by the slowdown in the world economic growth and the previously observed drop in food and other commodity prices  though its scale was smaller than in the preceding month. According to GUS preliminary estimates, in 2009 Q2 in Poland GDP increased by 1.1% y/y, which constituted a stronger than expected rise. GDP growth in 2009 Q2 resulted mainly from a positive contribution of net exports combined with a simultaneous decline in domestic demand driven by further curbing of consumption as well as by a decline in investment and inventories. Monthly data for 2009 Q3, including the data on industrial output, construction and assembly production and retail sales, as well as the majority of business confidence indicators signal further improvement in economic activity. Unfavourable situation is continuing in the labour market: employment in the enterprise sector is falling and the unemployment rate (seasonally-adjusted) is rising, accompanied by a further decline in the growth of both nominal and real wages. Economic growth is also constrained by reduced lending, in particular to the enterprise sector. In August 2009 the annual CPI inflation rose to 3.7%, remaining above the NBP inflation target of 2.5% and also slightly above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. A slight rise in inflation was mainly driven by an increase in the annual growth of food prices. The continuation of the annual inflation at a heightened level results, to a large extent, from the previous rises in regulated prices and the previously observed depreciation of zloty exchange rate. The relatively high level of core inflation indicates that the scale of demand weakening so far failed to fully offset the effect of increases in regulated price and the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate. In the Council's assessment, inflation is likely to remain at an elevated level in the coming months, mainly due to the relatively high annual growth of food prices and regulated prices, including, ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, above all, energy prices. In the medium term, however, low demand pressure and a slower growth of labour costs should be conducive to inflation decrease. In the Council's assessment, the probability of inflation running below the inflation target in the medium term is higher than the probability of its running above the target. At the same time, in the Council's assessment, the probability of inflation running below the inflation target in the medium term has decreased in recent months. In the Council's view, the expected improvement in the global economic activity and the implemented cuts in the NBP interest rates together with the lowering of the required reserve rate will support the return of the economy to the potential growth path. The Council's decisions in the coming months will take account of the incoming information on the outlook for economic growth and inflation, the situation in the financial markets in Poland and abroad, information on the public finance sector and the zloty exchange rate developments. The Council will continue to analyse the impact of developments in the domestic interbank market on the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Poland. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts required for euro adoption in Poland. The Council has adopted a resolution on the Monetary Policy Guidelines for the Year 2010 and approved the Forecast of the Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland for the Year 2010 together with the International Investment Position of Poland in 2008."
Euroarea,2009-10-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference here in Venice. I would like to thank Governor Draghi for his kind hospitality and to express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of the meeting of the Governing Council. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The incoming information and analyses since our last meeting in early September have confirmed our previous assessment. While annual HICP inflation was still slightly negative in September, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, it is expected to turn positive again in the coming months and to remain at moderately positive rates over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, the latest information further supports our view that the euro area economy is stabilising and is expected to recover at a gradual pace. As regards medium to longer-term inflation expectations, they remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit expansion continues to moderate. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Let me now explain our assessment in further detail, starting with the economic analysis. Available survey indicators continue to signal an ongoing stabilisation of economic activity. In particular, the euro area should benefit from a recovery in exports, the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures taken to restore the functioning of the financial system. In addition, following the substantial negative contributions in the first half of 2009, the inventory cycle is expected to contribute positively to real GDP growth in the second half of the year. However, uncertainty remains high and the volatility in incoming data warrants a cautious interpretation of the available information. It will be supported in the short term by a number of temporary factors but is likely to be affected over the medium term by the process of ongoing balance sheet correction in the financial and the non-financial sector of the economy, both inside and outside the euro area. In the view of the Governing Council, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. On the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve more quickly, the labour market deterioration may be less marked than previously expected and foreign demand may prove to be stronger than projected. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation stood at -0.3% in September, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, compared with -0.2% in August. The current negative inflation rates are in line with previous expectations and reflect largely base effects resulting from the movements in global commodity prices a year ago. Also owing to base effects, annual inflation rates are projected to turn positive again in the coming months. Thereafter, over the policy-relevant horizon, inflation is expected to remain in positive territory, with overall price and cost developments staying subdued reflecting ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. In this context, it is important to re-emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. They relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and to the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm that developments in broad money and credit growth remain subdued. In August, the annual growth of M3 and loans to the private sector declined further to historically low rates of 2.5% and 0.1% respectively. This parallel deceleration in money and credit growth confirms our previous assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. The ongoing deceleration in annual M3 growth has continued to be accompanied by a strengthening in annual M1 growth, which in August rose further to 13.6%. The strength of M1 reflects the fact that narrower spreads between the rates on different short-term deposits have fostered shifts in the allocation of funds from, in particular, short-term time deposits to overnight deposits. At the same time, the steep slope of the yield curve may have supported shifts from M3 to longer-term deposits and securities outside M3. The overall flow of bank loans to the non-financial private sector remained subdued in August. In the case of households, the latest data suggest that the decline in loan growth has been levelling off at low rates of expansion. In the case of non-financial corporations, following a few months of negative flows, the flow of loans was again slightly positive in August. Looking through the volatility in monthly data, loan growth continues to be very subdued. This is in line with the lag that normally prevails between trends in economic activity and developments in loans to enterprises. In this respect, given the subdued levels of production and trade, as well as the ongoing uncertainty with regard to the business outlook, further weak developments in loans to non-financial corporations in the coming months appear likely. At the same time, the ongoing improvement in financing conditions should support the demand for credit in the period ahead. Against the background of highly demanding challenges, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector, particularly as regards recapitalisation. The incoming information and analyses since our last meeting in early September have confirmed our previous assessment. While annual HICP inflation was still slightly negative in September, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, it is expected to turn positive again in the coming months and to remain at moderately positive rates over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, the latest information further supports our view that the euro area economy is stabilising and is expected to recover at a gradual pace. As regards medium to longer-term inflation expectations, they remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit expansion continues to moderate. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, we expect that our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy in full. Hence, with all the measures taken, including our latest 12-month longer-term refinancing operation of 30 September, monetary policy is providing strong ongoing support to the economy. Once the macroeconomic environment improves, the Governing Council will make sure that the measures taken are unwound in a timely fashion and that the liquidity provided is absorbed in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term. By so doing, the Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, the need for ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies is becoming increasingly pressing. It is vital that governments put in place concrete structural measures and convincingly communicate that they are committed to ensuring the sustainability of public finances. Governments should design their consolidation plans in line with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, ensuring that consolidation starts as soon as possible and at the latest when the recovery takes hold. These plans should also be accompanied by a strengthening of national budgetary frameworks. Consolidation efforts should be stepped up in 2011 and will need to exceed significantly the benchmark of 0.5% of GDP per annum set in the Stability and Growth Pact. In countries with high deficit and/or debt ratios, the annual structural adjustment should reach at least 1% of GDP. In view of the rapidly increasing public expenditure ratios, as well as projected further expenditure pressures owing to higher interest burdens and ageing-related costs, countries' structural measures should focus on the expenditure side. Turning to structural reforms, in all countries more efforts are crucial to support sustainable growth and employment as it is likely that the financial crisis has affected the productive capacity of our economies. In particular, appropriate wage-setting, sufficient labour market flexibility and effective incentives to work are required. At the same time, policies that enhance competition and innovation are urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create the business opportunities and productivity gains needed to ensure a sustained recovery. An appropriate restructuring and consolidation of the banking sector should also play an important role. Sound balance sheets, sound risk management, and transparent as well as robust business models are key to strengthening the financial soundness of banks and their resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and financial stability."
South Korea,2009-10-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. Domestic economic activity has sustained its improving trend thanks to the progress of global economic situation. Exports have continued their recovery and consumption has been outpacing that of last year. There still remains, however, uncertainty as to the economic growth path. Consumer price inflation seems likely to have remained generally stable. The upward trend of real estate prices has been maintained. Stock prices have consolidated following their sharp run-up. The enlargement of mortgage lending has slowed due to the expansion of the areas where debt-to-income ratios are applied and higher interest rates on loans. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain accommodative policy stance for the time being and do what is needed to bring about the continuation of the recent improving pattern of economic movements and financial market stabilization."
Chile,2009-10-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 October 2009 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50% (annual), and to continue applying the complementary monetary policy measures adopted in July's meeting. Internationally, recent data show stabilizing global growth prospects for this year. These prospects have resulted in a better environment in financial markets. Commodity prices, particularly for copper, have remained stable. Domestically, available information suggests that output and demand have expanded in recent months. Both unemployment and employment have remained stable. Lending conditions have improved in the margin but they are still tight. In September. CPI inflation was affected by its usual seasonality and the adjustment of electricity rates. Wage dynamics continue to be in line with historical patterns. Reduced y-o-y inflation figures are foreseen for the coming quarters. Medium-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The Board estimates that the macroeconomic environment and its monetary policy implications do not differ substantially from those of the last Monetary Policy Report. Therefore, it reiterates that the monetary policy interest rate will be held at its minimum level of 0.50% for a prolonged time period, and that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected annual inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Georgia,2009-10-13,"13.10.2009 The NBG Keeps its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) unchanged at 6 Percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on October 13, 2009 and decided to keep its main policy rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 6 percent. The annual rate of inflation was 0.4 percent in September and the average annual inflation currently stands at 2.5 percent. As was noted during the Committee's last meeting, an increase in the annual rate of inflation was expected. Current forecasts point to a year-end inflation of 3-4 percent. According to preliminary data, total net profit of the banking sector was GEL7 million in September. It must be noted that September of the current year is the first month since July, 2008 that the banks ended with a total net profit. An increase in bank lending is expected in the nearest future. The depreciation of the real effective exchange rate over the last year aided in the reduction of imports and boosted local economic activity, which reduced the trade deficit. As a result of the funds allocated by the International Monetary Fund and a decrease in foreign exchange interventions, the level of international reserves reached a historical maximum and surpassed USD2 billion in September. With the easing of the global economic crisis, several nations have begun to toughen their monetary policies (i.e. Australia), although most other nations around the world are not in a hurry to change their expansionary policies that are oriented towards economic stimulus, largely because a long and protracted recovery is expected from the global financial crisis. The National Bank of Georgia will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on November 25, 2009."
Peru,2009-10-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2009 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 1.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference interest rate at 1.25 percent. This decision to maintain the monetary stimulus unchanged is based on the sustained reduction of annual inflation inflation has declined from 6.65 percent in December to 1.2 percent in September and on the continuous reduction of inflation expectations. Inflation in September showed a rate of -0.09 percent as a result of the decline of the prices of some foodstuffs. Annual inflation is expected to transitorily fall below the lower band of the target range in the next months, in line with the forecasts of our last Inflation Report, as a result of the reversal of some supply shocks observed last year. Core inflation, which for the most part isolates these effects, recorded a rate of 0.16 percent, showing a similar rate to the one observed in the last 5 months (equivalent to an annual rate of 2 percent). Unless important changes were to be observed in inflation forecasts and in inflation determinants, no new adjustments are foreseen in the reference rate. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 2.05 percent. Overnight deposits: 0.45 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.05 percent. The interests on reserve requirements in foreign currency corresponding to additional reserve requirements, provided that they are deposited at this Central Bank, will be equivalent to 60 percent of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR rate). The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the next month on its session of November 5, 2009."
Turkiye,2009-10-15,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 7.25 percent to 6.75 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 9.75 percent to 9.25 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. is decreased from 3.25 percent to 2.75 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 12.75 percent to 12.25 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 8.75 percent to 8.25 percent. Recent data releases indicate that, in line with the Committee's previous assessments, the ongoing recovery in economic activity will be gradual and protracted. External demand and domestic investment demand remain weak. Moreover, consumption demand, after having increased markedly during the second quarter, is expected to display a weaker course in the third quarter. Although employment indicators show some improvement, it remains to be seen whether this will turn into a robust recovery. Therefore, inflation is expected to remain at low levels for a long period of time. Lingering problems across the global economy are not resolved completely and there are still uncertainties regarding the strength of the recovery. Taking these factors into account, the Committee reiterates that it will be necessary for the monetary policy to maintain an easing bias for a long period of time. The Committee notes that, the cumulative policy rate cuts implemented since November 2008, and the improvements in global risk perceptions have started to have favorable effects on credit markets. The Committee indicates that a slowdown in the pace of the rate cuts would be considered in the next meeting depending on the economic data and developments. In addition, the Committee, after taking liquidity conditions into consideration, has made the assessment that a limited reduction in Turkish Lira reserve requirements would alleviate the tightness in credit conditions, and thus enhance the effectiveness of the expansionary monetary policy. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Hungary,2009-10-19,"At its meeting on 19 October 2009, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by 50 basis points from 7.50% to 7.00%, with effect from 20 October 2009. The Monetary Council expects domestic economic growth to resume in the middle of 2010. Inflation is likely to exceed the medium-term target temporarily due to the indirect tax increases, and then to move materially below it in the second half of next year. Consistent with the more benign outlook for the world economy, there has been a steady improvement in global financial markets in recent months; however, it remains to be seen whether and for how long this process will continue. The monthly outcomes for consumer price inflation over the past quarter were below the Bank's expectations. The persistence of subdued inflation despite the increase in indirect taxes is attributable mainly to restraint imposed by weak demand on pricing. In the Monetary Council's judgement, the risk that inflation will fall significantly below the 3% target over the medium term has increased. Available labour market data suggest that the corporate sector has adjusted to weak domestic and foreign demand by moderating earnings growth and sharply reducing employment. Wage moderation is of key importance for firms seeking to maintain their competitiveness. Setting wages by taking into account the protracted recession and the expected low inflation environment may help keep jobs and contribute to a faster economic recovery. The reliance of the Hungarian economy on external sources of financing can only be reduced if a sustained improvement in external balance is achieved. Maintaining a disciplined fiscal policy approach is required to gradually reduce the country's vulnerability to shocks. A couple of measures taken by the Government to ensure that this year's deficit target is met could prove difficult to sustain in the longer run. This is a risk in terms of meeting the budget target for 2010 and poses a threat to the fiscal consolidation process. There has been a steady and substantial increase in global risk appetite in recent months, leading to a fall in the risk premium required by investors to hold Hungarian financial assets. However, the domestic economy continues to be vulnerable to shocks, which suggests the need for heightened caution in policy-setting. The Monetary Council decided to reduce the central bank base rate after considering the recent developments in inflation and the macroeconomy as well as in perceptions of risk. Interest rates may be reduced further, if this does not threaten the inflation outlook and if shifts in risk sentiment allow it."
Thailand,2009-10-21,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 21 October 2009 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Assistant Governor. Bank of Thailand, announces the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, as follows. The global economic and financial conditions have improved on account of accommodative monetary policy stance and fiscal stimulus packages, especially in major industrialized economies and China. The resulting rebound in private consumption of these countries in turn leads to a pick up in exports of other Asian economies. Nevertheless the MPC views that there remains uncertainty surrounding the global economic recovery, which is still reliant on sustained impetus from the fiscal stimulus. The latest economic data point towards a continued improvement of the Thai economy compared to the previous MPC meeting. The recovery of the manufacturing sector has become more broad-based, while export and tourism sectors have also improved. This improvement was significantly aided by accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus measures. Nevertheless domestic consumption and private investment are in an early stage of recovery and uncertainty about domestic demand remains, for instance in relation to the prospect for investment projects in the Map Ta Phut area. The MPC assesses that the Thai economy is expected to recover gradually, supported by the momentum of the global economy and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies. Meanwhile the inflationary pressure from the demand side continues to be subdued for the time being. The MPC views that the current level of policy interest rate is appropriate and supportive of the economic recovery. The MPC therefore decided to maintain the policy interest rate at 125 per cent per annum."
South Africa,2009-10-22,"1.1 The prospects for inflation returning to within the inflation target range by the second quarter of 2010 remain promising. Domestic demand conditions continue to be subdued and currently do not pose a significant threat to the inflation outlook. Economic growth is expected to improve in the coming months, but is likely to remain below potential for some time. Domestic growth prospects are dependent to an extent on the global recovery which appears to be uneven across countries and regions. However the medium-term inflation outlook has been affected adversely by possible further significant adjustments to electricity tariffs. 2.1 There has been no publication of consumer price index (CPI) data since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). The most recent data showed that the year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the CPI for all urban areas declined to 6,4 per cent in August, compared with 6,7 per cent in July. The main contributors to the inflation outcome were the categories of housing and utilities, and miscellaneous goods and services. 2.2 Producer prices declined at a year-on-year rate of 4,0 per cent in August, compared with a decline of 3,8 per cent in July. Food price inflation at the producer price level continues to signal dissipating pressures on food prices at the consumer price level. Agricultural product prices declined at a year-on-year rate of 2,0 per cent while manufactured food product prices increased at a rate of 0,1 per cent. Upside pressure on producer prices came from electricity prices which increased by 28,6 per cent. 3.1 The CPI inflation forecast by the South African Reserve Bank staff continues to indicate that inflation is likely to return to within the inflation target range, on a sustained basis, by the second quarter of 2010. CPI inflation is then expected to stay within the inflation target range for the rest of the forecast period until the end of 2011. Compared with the previous forecast, the outlook showed a slight improvement for 2010 and 2011, mainly as a result of the changed assumption regarding the rand exchange rate. No adjustment has been made at this stage to the central forecast for possible further increases in electricity tariffs over and above those that are already assumed in the baseline forecast. 3.2 A number of domestic and global factors have contributed to the persistent downward pressure on inflation. The global economy shows continued signs of improvement, but the recovery is not uniform across regions. The pace of recovery of most of the Asian economies has been higher than that achieved in the main industrialised economies. The timing and speed of the withdrawal of the fiscal and monetary policy stimuli may have a bearing on the nature of the recovery in these economies. Global inflation is expected to be constrained by the relatively weak demand from the industrialised countries, although the US dollar movements may provide some upward pressure to commodity prices. 3.3 There are some positive indications that the rate of contraction of the domestic economy has declined and that the economy may emerge from the recession by the end of 2009. However, the mixed picture from the published data shows that the recovery is likely to be tentative, and the output gap is likely to remain positive for some time. The physical volume of manufacturing output declined at a year-on-year rate of 15,0 per cent in August, and by 2,8 per cent on a month-on-month basis. However, in the three months to August, compared with the previous three months, an increase of 0,8 per cent was recorded. The Kagiso/BER Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) increased markedly from 39,3 index points in August to 48,0 index points in September. The index shows that new sales orders have increased significantly, while manufacturers' expectations of business conditions six months ahead improved to the highest level since early 2007. 3.4 Other sectoral developments indicate that the physical volume of total mining production increased in the three months to August but contracted on a month-on-month basis, whilst the real value of building plans passed continued to decline. The RMB/BER Business Confidence Indicator (BCI) declined to a ten-year low in the third quarter of 2009. The tentative nature of the domestic recovery is also reflected in the composite leading business cycle indicator compiled by the South African Reserve Bank which declined marginally in July, following three consecutive monthly increases. 3.5 Consumption expenditure by households also remains subdued, with real retail trade sales declining at a year-on-year rate of 7,0 per cent in August. In the three months to August, there was a 1,0 per cent decline, compared with the previous three months. Wholesale trade sales also declined further in August. Total new vehicle sales are also well below their levels of a year ago. However there are indications that the negative trend may have reached its lower turning point with zero or slightly positive rates of change being recorded on a month-on-month and quarter-on-quarter basis. The FNB/BER consumer confidence index declined in the third quarter of 2009 to a relatively neutral confidence level. 3.6 Credit extension to the private sector continued to reflect both the weak household consumption expenditure and the prevailing tighter credit criteria. The Ernst and Young financial services index indicates that credit standards applied by retail banks to loan applications continued to tighten in the third quarter of 2009 but at significantly lower levels. Twelve-month growth in banks' total loans and advances declined to 0,8 per cent in August 2009. Mortgage advances increased by 5,6 per cent in August, while instalment sale credit and leasing finance contracted by 4,2 per cent. Negative year-on-year growth rates were also recorded in credit card advances, bank overdrafts and general loans. 3.7 There has been some recovery in asset prices in recent months, but wealth effects do not appear to be posing an immediate threat to the inflation outlook. Domestic equity prices have increased markedly since March, but are still significantly below the levels reached in May 2008. The various house price indices indicate a moderation in the rate of decline in house prices. 3.8 The exchange rate of the rand continues to provide downside pressure on inflation and is currently trading at levels against the US dollar similar to those prevailing at the time of the previous MPC meeting. During the past month the rand traded in a range of around R7,20 and R7,79 against the US dollar. The exchange rate of the rand has appreciated by 28 per cent against the US dollar since the beginning of 2009 and by 20 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. 3.9 The international oil price has increased in the past week but does not pose an immediate threat to the inflation outlook. Having averaged around US$70 per barrel for a number of weeks, the price of North Sea Brent crude oil increased to current levels of around US$76 per barrel, mainly as a result of the weaker US dollar and improved global growth prospects. In October, the domestic price of 95 octane petrol was reduced by 40 cents per litre as a result of both lower product prices and an appreciated rand exchange rate. 3.10 The main risks to the inflation outlook emanate from cost pressures in the economy. The trend of wage settlements still poses an upside risk to the inflation outlook. However there appears to be some evidence that nominal wage increases are moderating, although increases have generally been above the inflation rate. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average level of wage settlements amounted to 9,4 per cent in the first nine months of 2009 compared with 9,6 per cent in the corresponding period of 2008. These increases are consistent with the Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) of Statistics South Africa, which reported that growth in average nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sector of the economy moderated from 11,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2009 to 8,7 per cent in the second quarter. Unit labour cost increases declined from 11,3 per cent in the first quarter to 9,3 per cent in the second quarter. 3.11 The substantial electricity tariff increases requested by Eskom are seen to be the main longer-term threat to the inflation outlook. Eskom has requested a trebling of the current electricity tariffs over the next three years, and the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) is expected to make a decision in February 2010. 4.1 The Monetary Policy Committee is of the view that overall the risks to the inflation outlook have not changed markedly since the previous meeting. Accordingly the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to leave the repurchase rate unchanged at 7,0 per cent per annum. The MPC will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will not hesitate to adjust the monetary policy stance should the risks to the inflation outlook change materially."
Israel,2009-10-26,"26.10.2009 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for November 2009 unchanged The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for November 2009 will be unchanged at 0.75 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell by 0.3 percent in August, below the range of expectations of between -0.2 percent and +0.2 percent. In the last twelve months the CPI has increased by 2.8 percent, and since the beginning of the year by 3.4 percent. However, excluding the effects of seasonality and the price increases resulting from changes in tax rates and surcharges (the increase in tax on cigarettes and fuel. VAT, and the water surcharge), the annual rate of inflation since the beginning of the year is around the midpoint of the inflation target range. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation expectations didnot change significantly during the last month. Expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital market remained stable at about 2.3 percent. The average of forecasters' inflation expectations for 2009 increased slightly, to 3.7 percent, and for the next twelve months, to 2.4 percent. Forecasters' expectations of the Bank of Israel interest rate are on average for an increase of 0.2 percentage points in the next three months, and for a rate of 2.6 percent in a year's time. Interest rate expectations derived from the capital market are for a rising trend, with the interest rate a year hence at 2.4 percent. Real economic activity: The positive signs of a turnaround in real economic activity persist, with a gradual economic recovery evident. The Companies Survey for the third quarter confirms this assessment. The overall net balance reported in the survey was positive for the first time since the second quarter of 2008. The composite state-of-the-economy index rose by 1.2 percent in September, its fourth successive rise. The rise resulted from increases in the indices of manufacturing production, trade and services revenue, services exports, and imports, while the index of goods exports declined. The labor market and wages: Labor market indicators reflect the uncertainty about the direction and strength of changes in the market, but taken together they suggest that it is stabilizing. Health tax revenues, which provide an up-to-date indicator of total wage payments, continued to increase in September for the third month in a row, and at a faster rate. In the months May-July the number of employee posts increased, and according to Employment Service data the number of work-seekers dropped. The unemployment rate based on the Central Bureau of Statistics trend estimates declined for the third consecutive month, and in August reached 7.6 percent.It should be noted, however, that the trend data figures tend to be revised. The real wage in May-July 2009 was 3.3 percent lower than that in May-July 2008, and the nominal wage, 0.1 percent lower. Budget data: In January-September 2009 the budget deficit (excluding credit) totaled NIS 21.9 billion, in contrast to a budget surplus of NIS 1.3 billion in those months in 2008. The forecast of the budget deficit in 2009 based on performance of the budget to date is that it will be below the target of 6 percent of GDP. Tax revenues have been recovering since July, and for the year 2009 are expected to exceed the budget forecast by 2.7 percent. In September the government approved a reallocation of budgetary expenditure, to finance non-recurring outlays by the Ministriesof Defense and Health. The foreign exchange market: In the last month the dollar again weakened against most currencies. In the period between the monetary policy discussions of 23 September and 25 October, the shekel strengthened by 1.1 percent against the dollar, weakened by 0.8 percent against the euro, and remained unchanged in terms of the index of the effective exchange rate vis-?-vis the currencies of Israel's trading partners (weighted by the volume of trade). The strengthening of the shekel against the dollar was not very different from the performance of other currencies vis-?-vis the dollar, with a significant number of the major currencies strengthening by more than did the shekel. The Bank of Israel's activity in the forex market served to moderate the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar. The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of 23 September and 25 October, the Tel Aviv 25 and the Tel Aviv 100 indices both rose by about 5.5 percent. Most leading stock exchanges aroundthe world also recorded share price increases. The positive trend in the government bond market continued this month. Over the above period, yields on makam declined--the yield on makam of up to a year fell by 0.2 percentage points, and is currently 1.48 percent. Yields on unindexed 10-year Israeli government bonds declined by 0.1 percentage points. Yieldson 10-year US government bonds increased by 0.07 percentage points, to 3.49 percent, so that the yield gap between Israeli unindexed bonds and the USbonds contracted, to 1.5 percentage points. In the period between the previous and the current interest rate discussions, the Tel-Bond 20 index increased by 2.3 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 2.7 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, declined in line with the global trend in CDS spreads. The money supply: The M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) fell in September by 1.2 percent, its first fall in a year, whereas the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits up to one year) increased by 0.7 percent. The world economy: Most of the economic data published last monthpoint to the stabilization of economic activity or beginnings of economic growth in the advanced economies, more rapid recovery in Asia, and growth in global manufacturing and world trade. Nonetheless, the international institutions assess that the recovery in the global economy will be slow and lengthy, and economic activity is currently below the pre-crisis level. The IMF stated this month that the global economy was emerging from the recession, and thus revised its growth forecast upwards, with a smaller global contraction of 1.1 percent in 2009, and higher positive growth of 3.1 percent in 2010. Inflation is low in most countries, and forecasts are that it will continue thus in the near future. Against this background, economic policy in most countries is expected to remain expansionary in the next few months. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for November unchanged at 0.75 percent will help keep inflation within the target range and underpin the recovery in real activity, while supporting financial stability. The main considerations behind the decision are: Inflation measured over the previous twelve months was 2.8 percent. Inflation from thebeginning of the year, however, excluding the effects of increased tax rates and surcharges and seasonally adjusted, was 1.9 percent at an annual rate, practically the middle of the target range. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months, both those of the forecasters and those derived fromthe capital market, remained this month at just above the midpoint of the target range. The existence of an output gap, the expectation that it will continue in 2010 despite the incipient recovery in economic activity, and the fact that the short-term effects of the government-initiated price increases will come to an end, will all act to moderate inflation over the next year. The economic indicators show continued recovery in economic activity in Israel. Nevertheless, there is still uncertainty regarding the strength of the recovery in Israel, mainly because of the uncertainty about the recovery in the global economy. World trade declined in August, after increasing in the previousmonths; the level of activity in the US, one of Israel's main export markets, remains low; unemployment is still high in the advanced economies, and also in Israel unemployment is still above the full employment level; budget deficits and public debt in the major economies after the crisis are high, and give rise to uncertainty about the rate of recovery in those countries. Interest rates of the leading central banks around the world are low, and are expectedto remain unchanged during the coming months. The Bank of Israel's decision to keep the interest rate for November unchanged and to continue with an expansionary monetary policy and with its foreign exchange market policy strikes a balance between maintaining price stability, supporting the recovery of the economy and boosting employment in light of the high unemployment rate, and preserving financial stability. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments, and will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives--price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. 26.10.2009 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for November 2009 unchanged.

India,2009-10-27,"Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2009-10: Press Statement by Dr.D. Subbarao. Governor ""This morning. I had a meeting with the chiefs of major banks where we discussed recent economic developments and where I announced the Second Quarter Review of the Reserve Bank's Monetary Policy for 2009-10. In the run up to this policy review, we consulted with a wide array of stakeholders and took their views on board. Banks generally welcomed the Reserve Bank's policy stance. They agreed with the Reserve Bank's emphasis on credit flows, particularly to agriculture and micro, small and medium enterprises to support the revival of growth. They indicated that while underlying economic activity has picked up, credit demand remains muted because the access of financing from external and domestic non-bank sources has eased significantly. Banks felt that credit growth prospects remain favourable going forward. Apart from credit offtake, discussion centred around specific issues such as the new liberalised policy on branch authorisation, changes in provisioning norms, infrastructure financing, currency management, priority sector lending certificates (PSLCs), and the recommendations of the Working Group on BPLR. Banks welcomed the liberalised policy on branch authorisation, which together with the liberalised business correspondents model, according to them, should promote financial inclusion and increase credit flow. As regards infrastructure financing by banks, the view was that while banks have a role in infrastructure financing, eventually it should be done through the corporate bond market with participation by long-term institution investors. Banks recognised the role of take-out financing and indicated that they are working with India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd. (IIFCL) on this issue. While banks welcomed the move to increase the provisioning requirement on commercial real estate exposures, they suggested certain modifications in the calculation of the provisioning cover and requested for more time. The Reserve Bank emphasised the importance of using modern technology, including note sorting machines. There was a general feeling that the merits and demerits of PSLCs need to be carefully examined. Banks were urged to generate the debate through seminars and workshops on the recommendations of the Working Group on BPLR. Global Economy There has been a discernable improvement in the global economy since the last review in July 2009. The recovery is underpinned by output expansion in emerging market economies, particularly in Asia. World output improved in the second quarter, manufacturing activity has picked up, trade is recovering, financial market conditions are improving, and risk appetite is returning. A sharp recovery in equity markets has enabled banks to raise capital to repair their balance sheets. There are concerns, however, that the recovery is fragile. Even as output is reviving, unemployment is expected to increase to over 10 per cent. Investment is also expected to remain weak due to ruptured balance sheets, excess capacity and financing constraints. Bank2 collapses are continuing. World trade still remains below its level a year ago. On balance, while global economic prospects have improved, uncertainties remain about the pace and sustainability of economic recovery. Indian Economy In India, too, there are definitive indications of the economy attaining the ‘escape velocity' and reverting to the growth track. This is despite the continuing contraction in exports and the worst drought since 1972. The performance of the industrial sector has improved markedly in recent months. Domestic and external financing conditions are on the upturn. Capital inflows have revived. Activity in the primary capital market has picked up and funding from non-bank domestic sources has eased. Liquidity conditions have remained easy and interest rates have softened in the money and credit markets. At the same time, some concerns persist. There are clear signs of rising inflation stemming largely from the supply side, particularly from food prices. Private consumption demand is yet to pick up. Agricultural production is expected to decline. Services sector growth remains below trend. Bank credit growth continues to be sluggish. Government Borrowing Management of the large government market borrowing programme in a non- disruptive manner has been a major challenge for the Reserve Bank. Consistent with the accommodative monetary stance, the Reserve Bank expanded its domestic assets through open market operations (OMO) and unwinding of market stabilisation scheme (MSS) securities to provide primary liquidity to support the borrowing programme. During 2009-10 so far, the Central Government has already completed over 80 per cent (Rs.3,19,911 crore) of its net market borrowing and State Governments have mobilised Rs.58,683 crore (net) through the market borrowing programme. Because of the front- loading of the market borrowing programme, net issuances under the Central Government borrowing programme in the remaining period of 2009-10 will be only around Rs.62,500 crore. In the context of the debate on raising the held to maturity (HTM) investment limit for banks, on considerations of the merits and demerits of the issue, the Reserve Bank has determined that it is not advisable to raise the HTM ratio. Liquidity Situation and Interest Rates The liquidity situation has remained comfortable since mid-November 2008 as evidenced by large absorption of nearly Rs.1,20,000 crore on a daily average basis under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) window of the Reserve Bank. With most commercial banks reducing their deposit rates, the cost of funds has declined enabling banks to reduce their lending rates. Growth Outlook On current assessment, the growth projection for GDP for 2009-10 has been retained at 6.0 per cent with an upward bias, unaltered from that made in the July review. This assumes a modest decline in agricultural production, as the South-West monsoon rainfall this year has been the weakest since 1972 affecting both yield and acreage of agricultural crops, but a faster recovery in industrial production. Inflation Outlook Inflation assessment has become increasingly complex in recent times in view of the wide divergence between the inflation rate based on the WPI and the various CPI inflation measures. The situation was aggravated by the deficient monsoon rainfall and drought condition in several parts of the country. While CPI inflation is now in double digit, the WPI inflation rate remains low.3 Taking into account the global trend in commodity prices and the domestic demand-supply balance, the base line projection for WPI inflation at end-March 2010 is placed at 6.5 per cent with an upward bias. This is higher than that of 5.0 per cent WPI inflation projected in the July 2009 Review as the upside risks have materialised. Money Supply Keeping in view the borrowing requirement of the Government and of the commercial sector in the remaining period of 2009-10, the indicative projection of money supply growth of 18 per cent set out in July 2009 Review is revised downwards to 17 per cent. Consistent with this, aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks are projected to grow by 18 per cent. The growth in adjusted non-food credit, including investment in bonds/debentures/shares of public sector undertakings and private corporate sector and CPs, is also revised downwards to 18 per cent from 20 per cent set out earlier. Banks are urged once again to step up their efforts towards credit expansion while preserving credit quality, which is critical for revival of growth. Managing the Recovery: Some Issues The attention around the world, as also in India, has shifted from managing the crisis to managing the recovery. The policy dilemma for India is different in some important respects from that of advanced economies as well as other emerging market economies for the following reasons: Most of these countries do not face an immediate risk of inflation, whereas India is actively confronted with an upturn in inflation. India has the challenge of reviving domestic consumption and investment demand, the traditional, dominant drivers of our growth, although households, firms and financial institutions in India are not struggling with impaired balance sheets unlike in advanced economies. India has traditionally been a supply constrained economy in contrast to advanced economies which are demand starved. The supply constraints, which remained subdued during the crisis period due to weak demand, will re-emerge and may indeed become binding. India is one of the few large emerging economies with twin deficits – fiscal and current account deficits. Exit Strategy Around the world there is an active debate on the timing and sequencing of exit from the expansionary monetary stance. ‘Exit' is a central issue in our policy matrix too. The challenge for the Reserve Bank is to support the recovery process without compromising on price stability. Growth drivers warrant a delayed exit, while inflation concerns call for an early exit. Premature exit will derail the fragile growth, but a delayed exit can potentially engender inflation expectations. This calls for a careful management of trade-offs. We have studied all the arguments for and against reversal of monetary easing. These arguments are detailed in the policy review document. The balance of judgment at the current juncture is that it may be appropriate to sequence the ‘exit' in a calibrated way so that while the recovery process is not hampered, inflation expectations remain anchored. Monetary Policy Stance On the basis of the above overall assessment, the stance of monetary policy for the remaining period of 2009-10 will be as follows:4 Keep a vigil on the trends in inflation and be prepared to respond swiftly and effectively through policy adjustments to stabilise inflation expectations. Monitor the liquidity situation closely and manage it actively to ensure that credit demands of productive sectors are adequately met while also securing price stability and financial stability. Maintain a monetary and interest rate regime consistent with price stability and financial stability, and supportive of the growth process. Way Forward The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor the price situation in its entirety and will take measures as warranted by the evolving macroeconomic conditions swiftly and effectively. Monetary Policy Measures For now, the Reserve Bank has decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.75 per cent, the reverse repo rate unchanged at 3.25 per cent and the CRR of banks unchanged at 5 per cent of their NDTL. The following measures constitute the first phase of ‘exit': The statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), which was reduced from 25 per cent of demand and time liabilities to 24 per cent, is being restored to 25 per cent. The limit for export credit refinance facility, which was raised to 50 per cent of eligible outstanding export credit, is being returned to the pre-crisis level of 15 per cent. The two unconventional refinance facilities: special refinance facility for scheduled commercial banks; and special term repo facility for scheduled commercial banks [for funding to mutual funds (MFs), non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and housing finance companies (HFCs)] are being discontinued with immediate effect. Further, the liabilities of scheduled banks arising from transactions in collateralised borrowing and lending obligations (CBLO) with Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL) would now be subject to the maintenance of the cash reserve ratio (CRR). Developmental and Regulatory Issues Let me now turn to development and regulatory issues. While India has been less affected by the crisis than most other countries, there are lessons from the crisis for India too, which include: further strengthening regulation at the systemic and institutional levels; making our supervision more effective and value adding; and improving our skills in risk management. Further, we need to actively pursue the challenge of financial inclusion. I will highlight a few actions being taken by us: Financial Stability Releasing of the first Financial Stability Report for India by December 2009. Interest Rates Considering the recommendations of the Working Group on the Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR) system after receiving feedback.5 Financial Market Products Proposal to introduce plain vanilla over-the-counter (OTC) single-name Credit Default Swaps (CDS) for corporate bonds for resident entities subject to appropriate safeguards. The operational framework will be finalised in consultation with market participants. Permitting recognised stock exchanges to offer currency futures contracts in currency pairs of Rupee-Euro. Rupee-Pound Sterling and Rupee-Japanese Yen, in addition to the existing Rupee-US dollar contracts. Regulatory Measures Increasing the provisioning requirement for advances to the commercial real estate sector classified as ‘standard assets' from 0.4 per cent to 1.0 per cent. Liberalising the extant branch authorisation policy for domestic non-RRB scheduled commercial banks. Allowing banks to build up capital for take-out exposures in a phased manner. Advising banks to augment their provisioning cushions consisting of specific provisions against non-performing assets (NPAs) as well as floating provisions so that their total provisioning coverage ratio, including floating provisions, reaches 70 per cent by September 2010. Issuing guidelines to private sector and foreign banks with regard to sound compensation policies. Introducing a category of NBFCs as ‘infrastructure NBFCs', defined as entities which hold minimum of 75 per cent of their total assets for financing infrastructure projects. Linking the risk weights of banks' exposure to infrastructure NBFCs to the credit rating assigned to the NBFC by external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs). Financial Inclusion Allowing banks to appoint the additional entities as business correspondents (BC); and collect reasonable service charges from the customer in a transparent manner for delivering the services through BC. Advising the lead banks to take steps to draw up a road map by March 2010 to provide banking services through a banking outlet in every village having a population of over 2,000, by March 2011. Constituting a Working Group to examine the issues involved in the introduction of priority sector lending certificates (PSLCs). Currency Management Mandating banks to install note sorting machines in all their branches in a phased manner in terms of a road map to be approved by the Reserve Bank."" G. Raghuraj Press Release : 2009-2010/632 Deputy General Manager."
Malaysia,2009-10-28,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 2.00 percent. Since the MPC in August, the international economic and financial conditions have improved further. Economic activity in the advanced economies has shown broader signs of stabilisation, supported by the impact of policy measures implemented and an improvement in consumer sentiment and business confidence. Several regional economies have reported positive growth in the third quarter, indicating that recovery in the region is ongoing. Notwithstanding these improvements, the outlook for the global economy continues to be uncertain, with recovery likely to be slow and uneven in view of the ongoing adjustments. In the domestic economy, stronger evidence has emerged to suggest that conditions are improving and a recovery in economic activity is gaining some strength. These improvements are more broad-based and are reflected in stronger labour market conditions, consumer and business sentiments, industrial production, financing activity and external trade. These positive developments are expected to continue into 2010, with growth in the domestic economy expected to continue to be supported by existing policy measures and the growing confidence in the private sector. Consumer prices declined at a slower rate in September. The decline in prices largely reflects the cumulative fall in fuel prices since June 2008 and the easing pressure on food prices. The decline in consumer prices, however, is expected to be temporary. Excluding further unanticipated price adjustments and external influences, inflation in 2010 is projected to be positive but remain subdued. With improving domestic economic conditions, and as price pressures and inflationary expectations are expected to remain contained going forward, the assessment is that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate and will continue to provide support to economic activity.

Poland,2009-10-28,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 28 October 2009 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 27-28 October 2009 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate at 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 3.75% on an annual basis. The latest data point to a further economic activity improvement in the United States and the euro area, even though activity remains subdued. Once again. GDP growth forecasts for 2010 have been slightly revised upwards in both economies. It is still difficult to assess the scale and sustainability of the expected recovery, especially given the persistent problems in the financial sector and the prospect of gradual restraint of stimulus packages. In major economies the decline in the general price level continued driven by the global economic slowdown and an earlier drop in food and other commodity prices. In turn, crude oil prices in the world markets picked up again. Data for 2009 Q3 on the Polish economy, including the data on industrial output, construction and assembly production and retail sales, as well as the majority of economic climate indicators signal further improvement in economic activity in that quarter. Unfavourable situation is continuing in the labour market: employment in the enterprise sector is falling, while the unemployment rate is rising. However, this was accompanied by a slightly higher than expected wage growth in enterprises. An adverse effect on economic growth is exerted by the tightening of banks' lending standards, in particular in relation to the enterprise sector. In September 2009 the annual CPI inflation decreased to 3.4%, i.e. slightly below the upper limit for deviations from the target set at the level of 3.5%, though it remained above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. The decline in inflation was mainly driven by a drop in the annual growth of food prices. The annual inflation rate remaining at an elevated level results, to a large extent, from the earlier administered price increases and the depreciation of zloty exchange rate. Persistently high core inflation means that the demand weakening so far has not fully offset the increase of administered prices and the earlier exchange rate depreciation. The Council got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute of the NBP. The projection is one of the inputs into the Council's decision-making on the NBP interest rates. In line with the October projection  under assumption of constant interest rates  there is a 50-percent probability that inflation will remain within the range of 3.33.5% in 2009 (against 2.83.5% in the June projection), 0.82.2% in 2010 (against 1.13.2%) and 1.13.2% in 2011 (against 0.83.4%). In the Council's assessment, inflation is likely to remain at an elevated level in the coming months, mainly due to the relatively high annual growth rate of administered prices, including especially energy prices, and food prices. Heightened inflation may also be supported by increase in oil prices, partially neutralised by hitherto zloty appreciation, and possible further growth of administered prices. However, in the medium term low demand pressure and slower growth of labour costs, amid persistent uncertainty regarding the growth outlook, should be leading to inflation decrease. Having taken the above into account, the Council assesses the probabilities of inflation in the medium term running below or above the inflation target to be balanced. In the Council's view, the expected improvement in the global economic activity and the implemented cuts in the NBP interest rates together with the lowering of the required reserve rate will support the return of the economy to the potential growth path. The Council's decisions in the coming months will take account of the incoming information on the outlook for economic growth and inflation, the situation in the financial markets in Poland and abroad, information on the public finance sector and zloty exchange rate developments. The Council will continue to analyse the impact of developments in the domestic interbank market on the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Poland. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts required for euro adoption in Poland. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  October 2009. Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland for 2009 Q2 and Opinion of the Monetary Policy Council on the Draft Budget Act for 2010."
Nigeria,2009-11-03,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 66 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. November 03, 2009 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today reviewed the domestic and external economic and financial developments for the year so far. The international economic scene, in the Committee's view, has turned out to be better than was projected about six months ago. Developed countries that were most adversely affected by the severe economic and financial crises have shown some signs of improvement in terms of output. However questions remain on the durability and sustainability of the recovery. There are also concerns over the high unemployment rates in these economies, although the stock and housing markets showed some evidence of picking up. The financial sector has been stabilized and measures are set to closely monitor and regulate it. The prices of primary commodities including crude oil have risen largely due to the fiscal and monetary stimulus and on news of recovery. The rise in commodity prices however has given rise to concerns about resurgence of inflation in the near future. Emerging countries on their part have registered fairly good growth rates and are poised to make further gains in 2010. The main concerns in the international economy relate to the robustness of the recovery and the possibility of incipient inflationary tendencies. It is against this background that the question of timing and dimension of fiscal and monetary tightening is being debated. The Committee reviewed the domestic economic developments bearing in mind the evolving international economic and financial situation. The review underscored the need for strengthening the on-going efforts at working out economic policies with reference to a desirable medium term path of economic growth along with price and financial stability. Monetary policy, the Committee emphasized, has to play an active role in the fulfillment of this task. In the short run, however, the space available for monetary policy is somewhat limited by the uncertainty about the sustainability and robustness of economic recovery in most major trading partner countries, the fiscal constraints largely brought about by the 1 growing gap between the rising expenditure demands and revenue receipts and the overall deceleration in domestic economic activities. The Committee noted with satisfaction that there has been a gradual downward movement in inflation in recent months but observed that this has mirrored essentially the slack demand. The Committee also noted that structural measures currently being undertaken to strengthen the banking sector and to foster financial stability would pave the way for improved effectiveness of monetary policy in the short to medium term. The Committee welcomed the recent upward movement in the prices of crude oil in international markets and hoped that it will be sustained in the near future. It considered the external payments situation to be manageable. In the Committee's view, the behavior of short term money market interest rates and exchange rates is in general consistent with the market fundamentals. Key Macro-economic and Financial Developments Output and Prices: Data on real GDP growth for Quarter 3 of 2009 is not yet firm but the provisional estimate of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) is 758 per cent. The NBS reported that in Quarters I and II, output grew by 450 per cent and 722 per cent, respectively. The Committee felt that on the basis of the output growth recorded thus far and other indicators, growth in 2009 would remain robust. The inflation rate as measured by the year-on-year increase in ‘all items' consumer price index was 104 per cent in September 2009. This outcome is lower than the headline inflation of 151 per cent in December 2008 and lower than the average headline inflation of 126 per cent for the first 9 months of the year. Food inflation has been between 125 and 130 per cent in Q III of the year. Monetary and Financial Market Developments: Broad money (M2) at the end of September 2009 showed an increase of 56 per cent on a year-on-year basis. The year-on- year movement in narrow money (M1) was negative 42 per cent as at end-September 2009 mainly on account of the decline in demand deposits. The trends in money supply movement reflect the fall in net foreign assets and slowdown in credit to private sector. This implied that the aggregate demand is not adequate, suggesting the need for the continuation of an accommodative monetary policy. Notwithstanding the low monetary growth, money market rates, reflected market realities. With the inter-bank money market guarantees in place and the measures to strengthen the banking sector, confidence in the money market has improved. This is reflected in the downward movement in the daily unsecured call rates. The average call rate for September 2009 was 998 per cent compared with 1038 per cent in August and 1764 per cent in July. The secured open buy-back (OBB) rate was 671 per cent for September, 2009, a shade higher than the 667 per cent in August but lower than the 747 per cent in July. The spread representing the counterparty credit risk thus narrowed to 327 basis points in September as against 365 basis points in August and 1017 basis points in July. In October, the call rate averaged 695 per cent while the average OBB rate was 608 per cent, the spread being mere 87 basis points. The Committee noted that in October excess reserves of banks with the CBN were high with the average daily excess reserves exceeding the average in any of the preceding four months of the year. Some banks took recourse to standing deposit facilities with sharp increase since the middle of the month. No bank accessed the standing lending facilities during the same period. While this could be considered a structural phenomenon in view of the mid-month Federation Accounts Allocations, the sharp recourse to standing deposit facility and non-use of the standing lending facility in the latter-half of the month seem to suggest that there is scope to reset the rates on standing facilities so as to eliminate perverse incentives and encourage banks to enlarge their asset portfolios in a prudent manner. Stock market developments continued to be marked by caution. In October 2009, the year-on-year declines in the average share price index and market capitalization were 470 per cent and 424 per cent respectively. The declines, however, are an improvement over the average declines of 576 per cent in the share prices and 507 per cent in market capitalization in the first nine months of the year. This may be attributable to the 3 emerging news that the financial conditions of the domestic banking sector has been strengthened by the injection of funds by the CBN and the major stock markets of the world have shown improved investor sentiments following reports of imminent recovery in the medium term. External Sector Developments: The foreign exchange market has been stable. The official exchange rate stood at an average of N1493578 per US dollar in October 2009. The inter-bank market rate averaged N1501252/$US. There was thus a slight appreciation of the Naira during the month. The spread between the rates has continued to be insignificant. Foreign exchange reserves stood at US$4334 billion as at end September 2009, an improvement of about US$ 164 billion over August, mainly owing to the receipt of the SDR allocation. As at October 30, 2009, foreign exchange reserves are provisionally estimated to be US$4305 billion. Crude oil prices in the international markets have edged upward in recent weeks. If the current oil price trend is sustained and if the expected recovery in both developed and emerging countries is realized, there will be further improvement in the level of foreign exchange reserves, with implications for liquidity and exchange rate management. The Committee will continue to ensure stable exchange rates determined by market forces. The Committee's Considerations The Committee observed that while inflation has decelerated, it is important to recognize that seasonal factors and the planned deregulation of the prices of petroleum products pose a major risk to inflation outlook in the near to medium term. It is this context that heightens the criticality of the policy dilemma now being faced by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Providing further impetus to the current accommodative monetary policy could be inflationary in the short to medium term whereas the gap between the likely output growth and the trend rate of growth as well as the fragility of economic recovery in many of the systemically important countries point to the need for maintaining 4 monetary accommodation along with reasonable fiscal stimulus. The Committee also noted the existing paradox of the co-existence of system-wide liquidity shortages as reflected in the data on monetary and credit aggregates and abundant liquidity with some banks as evidenced from the data on standing facilities. The CBN, in the light of these considerations, has to take a balanced view of the measures required for fostering growth prospects and containing inflationary pressures on a sustained basis and also to further strengthen the liquidity management. Decisions In the light of the above, the Committee took the following decisions: 1. The Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) will remain unchanged at 6 per cent, but an asymmetric corridor of interest rates around the MPR is introduced. The rate on the standing lending facility will remain at 200 basis points above the MPR, while the rate on the standing deposit facility will be 400 basis points below the MPR. There will be quantitative easing to bridge the gap currently estimated at about N500 billion between the levels of the current monetary aggregates and the benchmark levels for 2009. The modalities for quantitative easing include investments in bonds to be issued by Asset Management Company (AMC). The setting up of AMC, however, is subject to the approval of the National Assembly. Other modalities include the redemption of promissory notes issued by the Federal Ministry of Finance as well as by the CBN in connection with the retirement of debt and liabilities arising from purchase and assumption of failed banks. Purchase of loans by banks under the AMC will be based on terms aimed at strengthening the balance sheets with a focus on asset quality, improving liquidity and capital adequacy as well as on reducing debt overhang relating to the stock market in order to stimulate activity in the capital market. With effect from November 16, 2009, the temporary ban placed by the CBN on the use of Bankers' Acceptances (BAs) and Commercial Papers (CPs) will be lifted. Guidelines will be issued by the CBN prior to that date. In view of the fact that the audit of banks have been concluded and adequate provisions have been made for non-performing loans and to stimulate credit growth and strengthen banks' balance sheets, the 1 per cent general provision on performing loans contained in the existing prudential guidelines is hereby waived for the year 2009 as a countercyclical measure. New prudential guidelines will be issued before the end of Q1 2010. The totality of these measures is aimed at improving system liquidity and financial stability to regenerate confidence in the Nigerian markets and to further stimulate growth. The MPC is conscious of the upside risks as a result of quantitative easing but holds the view that progress in the execution of capital projects and favourable outlook on agricultural output growth will moderate the upside risks. The priority, therefore, is to stimulate growth in output and to ensure financial stability with a view to improving the effectiveness of monetary policy. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi Governor.

Romania,2009-11-03,"In its meeting of November 3, 2009, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR Board has set the annual inflation target for 2011 at 3.0 percent, ±1 percentage point variation band, down from 3.5 percent in 2010. The target will be discussed with the government. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for November 6, 2009. The analysis of macroeconomic indicators developments reveals a consolidation of disinflation with a certain lag, a persistent economic contraction and an ongoing significant adjustment of the external deficit, along with a worsening of foreign investors' perception regarding the Romanian economy amid heightened tensions in the domestic political field. The annual inflation rate slid marginally to 4.94 percent in September from 4.96 percent in the previous month due to increases in excise duties on tobacco and moderate fluctuations of the leu exchange rate. The adjusted annual CORE2 inflation  calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruits, eggs and fuel) as well as of the prices of major items subject to excise duties, i.e. tobacco and alcohol  fell to an annual rate of 4.2 percent in September from 4.5 percent a month before. In the monetary area it is worth noting the reduction in annual terms of credit to the private sector, especially of the leu-denominated component, as well as the fast annual dynamics of government credit. Meanwhile, the spread between interbank money market rates and the monetary policy rate widened in the context of a heightened impact on the money market of the substantial budget deficit financing needs for the last quarter of this year. The monetary policy stance continued to be prudent, the successive previous adjustments of the monetary policy rate and the firm management of liquidity seeking to ensure adequate broad monetary conditions with a view to consolidating the convergence of inflation towards medium-term objectives and a sustainable revival of lending activity in the economy as a whole. Nevertheless, in the short-run, inflationary pressures due to an anticipated upward adjustment of excise duties starting with January 1, 2010, the persistence of the spread between interbank rates and the monetary policy rate as well as the unfavourable impact on expectations coming from heightened risks related to fiscal and income policies, given the volatile political climate, are to be expected. Under these circumstances, preserving the prospects of a return of the inflation rate close to the established medium-term targets and anchoring inflation expectations require the maintenance of a prudent monetary policy stance. Moreover, in order to ensure the sustainability of this process and pave the way for a lasting economic relaunch, a rapid fulfilment by the other components of the macroeconomic policy mix of the commitments under the multilateral external financing arrangement with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions, is necessary. In light of the available data and of the assessment of recent and upcoming developments, the NBR Board has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 8.0 percent per annum. The NBR Board also decided to ensure a firm management of liquidity in the banking sector in order to consolidate the transmission of monetary policy signals and a return of the interbank rates in the vicinity of the monetary policy rate, as well as to maintain the existing level of minimum reserve requirements ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board has also set the annual inflation target for 2011 at 3.0 percent, ±1 percentage point variation band, down from 3.5 percent in 2010. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses the recent macroeconomic environment and the inflation outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The Report will be presented to the public in a news conference scheduled for November 6, 2009. The NBR Board believes a firm implementation of the macroeconomic policy mix  monetary, fiscal and income- as well as of the structural reforms agreed under the multilateral external financing arrangement are essential for achieving disinflation objectives, restoring investors' confidence, ensuring a sustainable financing of the Romanian economy as well as creating conditions for a lasting economic recovery. The NBR Board reiterates that the central bank will continue to closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by using its available instruments, to ensure the fulfillment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for January 5, 2010."
Philippines,2009-11-04,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates steady at 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. In its assessment of the monetary policy stance, the Monetary Board considers the current settings as appropriate. The latest inflation forecasts reflected a slightly higher path, but remained closer to the lower bound of the targets over the policy horizon. Demand-side pressures on consumer prices continue to be limited and inflation expectations well anchored. On the supply side, price pressures from crop losses due to the recent calamities are not expected to have a significant long-lasting impact on inflation. With such flexibility, the Board also believes that keeping the policy rates steady will help support domestic demand, including the reconstruction efforts of the government, and economic activity in the near term. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor the risks to the inflation outlook, which include commodity prices, and will adjust monetary policy settings if needed to achieve its price stability objective. At the same time, the BSP reiterates its support for non-monetary government measures to address supply-side risks to consumer prices."
United States,2009-11-04,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity has continued to pick up. Conditions in financial markets were roughly unchanged, on balance, over the intermeeting period. Activity in the housing sector has increased over recent months. Household spending appears to be expanding but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability. With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. The amount of agency debt purchases, while somewhat less than the previously announced maximum of $200 billion, is consistent with the recent path of purchases and reflects the limited availability of agency debt. In order to promote a smooth transition in markets, the Committee will gradually slow the pace of its purchases of both agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities and anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010. The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Charles L Evans; Donald L Kohn; Jeffrey M Lacker; Dennis P Lockhart; Daniel K Tarullo; Kevin M Warsh; and Janet L Yellen."

Euroarea,2009-11-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference today. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The incoming information and analyses that have become available since our meeting in early October have confirmed our expectations. While annual HICP inflation was -0.1% in October, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, it is expected to turn positive again in the coming months and to remain at moderately positive rates over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, the latest information continues to signal an improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year. The Governing Council expects the euro area economy in 2010 to recover at a gradual pace, recognising that the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit growth continues to slow down. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Available data and survey-based indicators continue to signal an improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year. In particular, the euro area should benefit from the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports, as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. Taking into account all available information, in the second half of this year, quarterly real GDP growth rates could be back in positive territory. However, uncertainty remains high as a number of the supporting factors are of a temporary nature. Looking through the volatility of incoming data, the euro area economy is expected to recover at a gradual pace in 2010, as it is likely to be affected over the medium term by the process of ongoing balance sheet adjustment in the financial and the non-financial sector, both inside and outside the euro area. In the view of the Governing Council, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. On the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve more quickly, the labour market deterioration may be less marked than previously expected and foreign demand may prove to be stronger than projected. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation stood at -0.1% in October, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, compared with -0.3% in September. The current negative inflation rates are in line with previous expectations and reflect mainly movements in global commodity prices over the last year. In the coming months, annual inflation rates are projected to turn positive again, also relating to base effects. Thereafter, over the policy-relevant horizon, inflation is expected to remain positive, with overall price and cost developments staying subdued reflecting ongoing sluggish demand in the euro area and elsewhere. In this context, it is important to re-emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. They relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and to the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rates of M3 and loans to the private sector declined further in September, to 1.8% and -0.3% respectively. These concurrent declines support the assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. In the next few months, the annual growth rates of monetary aggregates will most likely be affected downwards by base effects that are associated with the intensification of the financial turmoil one year ago. More fundamentally, however, the growth of M1 and M3 continues to reflect the current constellation of interest rates. While the narrow spread between the rates on different short-term deposits fosters shifts in the allocation of funds to the most liquid assets contained in M1, the steep slope of the yield curve also encourages such shifts from M3 to longer-term deposits and securities outside M3. The annual growth rate of bank loans to the non-financial private sector turned slightly negative in September, with annual loan growth to both non-financial corporations and households declining further and being negative. At the same time, the monthly flows of loans to households remained positive and even increased, while those of loans to non-financial corporations were negative. In the case of households, the latest data provide further confirmation of a levelling-off at low rates. In the case of non-financial corporations, the subdued levels of production and trade, as well as the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the business outlook, continue to dampen firms' demand for bank financing, a tendency which is likely to prevail in the coming months. In this respect, it is worthwhile to note that the growth of loans to enterprises typically only picks up with some lag compared with the cycle in economic activity. At the same time, the ongoing improvement in financing conditions should support the demand for credit in the period ahead. Against the background of highly demanding challenges, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector, particularly as regards recapitalisation. The incoming information and analyses that have become available since our meeting in early October have confirmed our expectations. While annual HICP inflation was -0.1% in October, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, it is expected to turn positive again in the coming months and to remain at moderately positive rates over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, the latest information continues to signal an improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year. The Governing Council expects the euro area economy in 2010 to recover at a gradual pace, recognising that the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit growth continues to slow down. Against this background, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, we expect that our policy action will progressively feed through to the economy. Hence, with all the measures we have taken, monetary policy has been supporting the availability of liquidity and the recovery of the euro area economy. Looking ahead, and taking into account the improved conditions in financial markets, not all our liquidity measures will be needed to the same extent as in the past. Accordingly, the Governing Council will make sure that the extraordinary liquidity measures taken are phased out in a timely and gradual fashion and that the liquidity provided is absorbed in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term. By so doing, the Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, many euro area governments are faced with high and sharply rising fiscal imbalances. If not addressed by a clear and credible exit strategy, this could seriously risk undermining public confidence in the sustainability of public finances and the economic recovery. The very large government borrowing requirements carry the risk of triggering rapid changes in market sentiment, leading to less favourable medium and long-term interest rates. This in turn would dampen private investment and thereby weaken the foundations for a return to sustained growth. Moreover, high public deficits and debts may complicate the task of the single monetary policy to maintain price stability. The Governing Council therefore calls upon governments to communicate and implement in a timely fashion ambitious fiscal exit and consolidation strategies based on realistic growth assumptions, with a strong focus on expenditure reforms. Tax cuts should only be considered over the medium term, when countries have regained sufficient room for budgetary manoeuvre. In this regard, the recent ECOFIN Council conclusions, which call for consolidation to start in 2011 at the latest and to go well beyond the structural benchmark of 0.5% of GDP per annum, represent the minimum requirement for all euro area countries. The success of fiscal adjustment strategies will also depend crucially on the transparency of the budgetary procedures and the reliability and completeness of government finance statistics. This is an area in which quick and decisive progress is indispensable for the countries concerned and for the euro area as a whole. Turning to structural reforms, in all countries more efforts are crucial to support sustainable growth and employment as it is likely that the financial crisis has affected the productive capacity of our economies. Moderate wage-setting, sufficient labour market flexibility and effective incentives to work are required in order to avoid significantly higher structural unemployment over the coming years. Policies that enhance competition and innovation are also urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create new business opportunities. An appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should also play an important role. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management, and transparent as well as robust business models are key to strengthening banks' resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and financial stability."
Egypt,2009-11-05,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release November 5, 2009 In its meeting held on November 5, 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep its overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchange. The discount rate was also kept unchange. Annual headline CPI inflation increased to 108 percent in September 2009, compared to 9 percent in Augus. CBE's core inflation measure, which excludes volatile food items, namely fruits & vegetables, as well as regulated prices, recorded an annual rate of 63 percent, compared to 58 percent in the previous month and remains within the CBE's comfort zon. Fruits and vegetables continued to be the determining factor in the headline inflation outturn, contributing by 11 percentage points to the monthly increase of 18 percentage points recorded in September 200. This comes as a continuation of a trend that started in February 2009 whereby shocks related to fruits and vegetables, amplified annual headline inflation, accounting for 54 percent of the 108 percent recorded in September 200. In the meantime, the increase in core inflation was mainly driven by higher food prices, particularly meat and sugar, whereas paid services and retail prices have remained broadly unchanged since February and April 2009, respectivel. In the meantime, annual real GDP growth in 2008/09 recorded 47 percen. This outturn has been better than previously expected at the outset of the global financial crisis yet remains below the 7 percent average registered over the past three year. There are encouraging signs that the global slowdown has stabilized somewhat over recent months and the outlook for the international economy appears to have improved as wel. This coupled, with the domestic fiscal and monetary measures undertaken so far will help provide a conducive environment for the domestic econom. Against this background, the MPC assesses that the current level of policy interest rate is appropriate and supportive of the economic recovery while consistent with maintaining core inflation within the CBE's comfort zone in the medium-ter. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Division Chief.

Chile,2009-11-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 12 November 2009 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50% (annual). In addition, it decided to reduce the maximum term for the FLAP from 180 to 150 days starting December 14th, and to continue reducing it by 30 days each month, in order to extinguish access to this facility in May of next year. Internationally, recent data confirm prospects for global activity for this and next year. These prospects have contributed to a progressive stabilization of financial markets. Commodity prices have risen. Domestically, available information suggests that, despite the setback of September, output and demand increased in the third quarter, although at a slower pace than forecasted. Both unemployment and employment have remained stable. Lending conditions have improved in the margin but are still tight. In October. CPI inflation and the various core measures showed no variation. Wage dynamics continued to be in line with historical patterns. Reduced y-o-y inflation rates are foreseen for the coming quarters. Medium-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The real exchange rate has fallen. The Board estimates that the macroeconomic environment and its monetary policy implications do not differ substantially from those of the last Monetary Policy Report. This is consistent with a monetary policy interest rate that will be held at its minimum level of 0.50% for a prolonged period of time that will last at least until the second quarter of next year. * The Spanish original prevails. The Board estimates that the pace of monetary policy rate normalization during the second half of next year will be more gradual than the one implicit in financial asset prices. Therefore, it reiterates that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected annual inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon."
South Korea,2009-11-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. Domestic economic activity has shown a recovering trend thanks to the progress of global economic situation. Exports, domestic demand and production have improved further. There still remains, however, uncertainty as to the economic growth path. Consumer price inflation has continued stable, influenced by the appreciation of the Korean won against the US dollar. The upward trend of real estate prices appears to have faltered. In the financial markets, the volatility of price variables such as stock prices and interest rates has expanded somewhat while the growth of mortgage lending has continued to flatten out due to the expansion of the areas where debt-to-income ratios are applied and higher lending rates. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain the accommodative policy stance for the time being with an emphasis on sustaining the recovery of economic activity."
Peru,2009-11-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR NOVEMBER 2009 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 1.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference interest rate at 1.25 percent. This decision to maintain the monetary stimulus unchanged is based on the sustained reduction of annual inflation inflation has declined to 0.71 percent in October and on the continuous reduction of inflation expectations. Inflation in October showed a rate of 0.12 percent as a result of the decline of the prices of some foodstuffs. Annual inflation has continued to decline, in line with the forecasts of our last Inflation Report. Advanced indicators of economic activity show signs of recovery, but no signals of inflationary pressures are observed in the short term. Thus, the rate of inflation in the next months should continue to be below the lower band of the target range due to the reversal of the supply shocks recorded last year. Unless important changes were to be observed in inflation forecasts and in inflation determinants, no new adjustments of the reference rate are foreseen. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 2.05 percent. Overnight deposits: 0.45 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the next month on its session of December 10, 2009."
Romania,2009-11-16,"On November 16, 2009, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has held a special meeting to analyze the budgetary, monetary and financial impact of the deviation from the external borrowing calendar for the fourth quarter of this year under Romania's multilateral arrangement with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions. Given the delayed external inflows, ensuring a proper financing of the government sector borrowing needs from domestic market resources in the last part of 2009, while preserving the macroeconomic equilibria, requires adequate financing conditions in the Romanian banking system. Therefore, the NBR Board has decided to lower the minimum reserve requirements ratio on foreign currency-denominated liabilities with residual maturities of up to two years to 25 percent from 30 percent starting with the November 24-December 23, 2009, maintenance period. The decision aims also to gradually align the minimum reserve requirements ratios to European Central Bank standards. In line with the previously announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for January 5, 2010."
South Africa,2009-11-17,"There are signs that the domestic economy will continue on its recovery path but economic growth is expected to remain below potential for some time; and dependent to some extent on the pace of the global recovery, which still appears to be fragile and uneven across regions. Economic growth is also expected to be constrained by subdued domestic consumption expenditure. The domestic outlook for inflation remains favourable as a result of weak demand pressures and the main threat to the inflation outlook emanates from possible electricity price increases. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas declined from 6,4 per cent in August 2009 to 6,1 per cent in September. The single biggest contributor to the inflation outcome was the category of housing and utilities which accounted for 1,7 percentage points. This was mainly due to the electricity component which increased at a year-on-year rate of 29,1 per cent. Food price inflation continued to moderate, and at 4,9 per cent is now exerting downward pressure on overall inflation. Goods price inflation measured 4,9 per cent, compared with services price inflation of 7,8 per cent. Producer prices declined for the fifth successive month in September, with the headline producer price inflation measuring -3,7 per cent. Most categories in the index exhibited low or negative year-on-year rates of inflation, apart from electricity, gas and water, and tobacco products. The CPI inflation forecast by the South African Reserve Bank (the Bank) continues to indicate that inflation is likely to return to within the inflation target range, on a sustained basis, by the second quarter of 2010. There may however be temporary declines to within the target range before then. CPI inflation is expected to remain within the inflation target range until the end of the forecast period in the final quarter of 2011, when it is forecast to average 5,5 per cent. Given the current uncertainty related to Eskom's tariff application to NERSA, the forecast does not make provision for the higher increases requested by Eskom, and electricity price increases of 25 per cent in 2010 and 2011 are assumed. The forecast of the Bank is in line with those of private sector analysts. According to the latest Reuters consensus forecast, inflation is expected to average 5,7 per cent in 2010 and 5,85 per cent in 2011. There are no major demand side pressures on inflation, and the assessment of the Committee is that there are no significant upside risks to the inflation outlook emanating from this source. Real retail sales growth has been negative, but there is further evidence that motor vehicle sales may have reached their lower turning point. Although total vehicle sales in October were 12,5 per cent lower than a year ago, when the three months to October 2009 are compared with the preceding three months, an increase of 1,4 per cent was recorded. The recovery has been in passenger vehicle sales and exports. Commercial vehicle sales are still declining. Consumption expenditure is expected to remain subdued, despite the lower interest rate environment, as a result of tighter lending conditions by banks, high levels of consumer indebtedness, negative wealth effects or impaired household balance sheets, and higher levels of unemployment. Credit extension to the private sector reflects weak demand by households and the corporate sector, and tight lending conditions by banks in response to higher perceived risk and rising impaired advances. Twelve-month growth in banks' total loans and advances declined to -0,2 per cent in September 2009. Growth in mortgage advances to the private sector declined further in September, measuring 4,8 per cent. The other main categories of loans and advances, namely instalment sale and leasing finance, credit card advances, bank overdrafts and general loans, all contracted. Consumption expenditure is also constrained by high debt levels and negative wealth effects, although asset values have recovered somewhat from their lows earlier in the year. The all-share index on the JSE Limited is currently about 50 per cent higher than the most recent lowest point in March of 2009. House prices also appear to be recovering, with the various house price indices reflecting either small positive growth or moderate declines in October. Labour market developments are also likely to constrain household consumption expenditure. According to the Quarterly Labour Force survey, approximately 800,000 jobs have been lost since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2008. The Quarterly Employment Statistics show a decline of over 200,000 formal sector jobs between the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2008 and the end of the second quarter of 2009. Domestic output appears to be recovering and the leading business cycle indicator of the Bank has continued its positive trend. There are still some doubts about the speed of recovery, and the output gap remains relatively wide. Most forecasts suggest that positive growth will have resumed by the fourth quarter of 2009, but there is less unanimity about the third quarter outcome. The outlook is also not even across sectors. The monthly data suggests that the mining sector contracted further in the third quarter, but the manufacturing sector performance on a quarter-on-quarter basis was relatively robust. According to Statistics South Africa, the physical volume of mining production declined by 7,5 per cent in the three months to September compared with the previous three months. However, a more positive trend may be expected in the fourth quarter. The physical volume of manufacturing production increased by 2,6 per cent over the same period. This outcome is consistent with the Kagiso/BER Purchasing Managers Index, which although still reflecting a contraction in manufacturing, has rebounded significantly and the forward-looking indicators in the index are generally positive. There is a risk however that this recovery could be affected by low consumption expenditure growth. The outlook for the construction sector appears to be less favourable. The real value of building plans passed declined by 18,5 per cent on a year-on-year basis in August, while in the three months to August compared with the previous three months a decrease of 27,7 per cent was recorded. The FNB Civil Construction Index also declined significantly in the third quarter of 2009. Fiscal policy developments are not seen to be a threat to the inflation outlook. The revised budgeted deficit of 7,6 per cent of GDP announced in the MTBPS is to a significant extent due to lower tax revenues, a result of low economic growth, and is therefore part of the workings of the automatic stabilisers. The previous fiscal prudence has provided sufficient space for increased borrowing to fund the shortfall. The deficit is expected to narrow as growth gains momentum. No significant upside risks to the inflation outlook are expected from food prices. Food price inflation has declined to below 5 per cent, and this favourable trend is expected to continue. Consumer food prices tend to lag food price developments at the producer price level, and the latter have been either declining or rising marginally over the past months. In October, manufactured food prices declined at a year-on-year rate of 1,8 per cent, while agricultural product prices declined by 2,4 per cent. The current spot and future prices of agricultural commodities indicate that no significant upward pressures are expected in the near future. For the past year petrol prices have exerted downward pressure on inflation as a result of the appreciation of the rand and relatively low international product prices compared to the previous year. However, these favourable base effects are not expected to continue. Over the past few months the international oil prices have remained relatively stable but some account is taken in the forecast for possible increases in the international oil price should the global recovery accelerate. In November the domestic petrol price remained unchanged, and should current trends continue, a modest increase in the petrol price is possible in December. The rand has remained a positive factor in the inflation outlook, notwithstanding some volatility during the month. Since the previous MPC meeting, the rand has traded in a range between R7.30 and R7.90 against the US dollar. The rand's movements have been influenced to a large extent by exogenous factors, in particular movements in the dollar, a resumption in global capital flows to emerging markets, and a recovery in commodity prices. Since the beginning of the year the rand has appreciated by 20 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The global economic recovery has been led by the emerging Asian economies. However the turnaround in the advanced economies is less certain. While there are positive signs, the recent higher growth rates have been driven by a turn in the inventory cycle, and the continued weakness in consumption expenditure in the United States in particular, and rising levels of unemployment pose risks to the recovery. The nature and speed of exit strategies from the previous stimulus packages also remain a risk to the outlook. The global environment remains benign from an inflation perspective. Despite moderately higher commodity prices, there are no significant risks to the global inflation outlook. As in the past few meetings, the main risks to the inflation outlook are seen to emanate from electricity price increases and the possible second round effects thereof. In addition the trend of wage settlements continues to pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook. The Monetary Policy Committee, having reviewed the global and domestic economic and financial developments, has decided to maintain the current stance of monetary policy and to leave the repurchase rate unchanged at 7 per cent per annum. ADDENDUM TO THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. During 2009, against the background of heightened volatility and uncertainty in international financial markets and the severe downturn in the global economy, the Monetary Policy Committee decided that it would be appropriate to meet more frequently for the rest of the year in order to assess the changing circumstances in a timeous manner and to be able to act appropriately when necessary. Although risks still remain, the global environment appears to have stabilised somewhat. The MPC has therefore decided to revert to the previous pattern of meeting every alternate month. Should the need arise, this frequency will be reconsidered. Accordingly, the meeting scheduled for 16 and 17 December has been cancelled and the meeting schedule for 2010 is as follows:."
Turkiye,2009-11-19,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 6.75 percent to 6.50 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 9.25 percent to 9 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. is decreased from 2.75 percent to 2.50 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 12.25 percent to 12 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 8.25 percent to 8 percent. Recent data releases indicate that, in line with the Committee's previous assessments, the ongoing recovery in economic activity will be gradual and protracted. External demand and domestic investment demand remain weak. Moreover, consumption demand has displayed a weaker course, after having increased markedly during the second quarter. Indicators on labor market suggest that it will take a long time for the employment conditions to fully recover. Although headline annual inflation could display some upward movements through mid-2010 due to strong base effects, resource utilization, and hence inflation, is expected to hover around low levels. Accordingly, the Committee has indicated that the monetary policy stance outlined in the Inflation Report would be maintained. The Committee notes that the cumulative policy rate cuts implemented since November 2008 and the improvements in global risk perceptions have started to exert favorable effects on credit markets. However, lingering problems across the global economy are not resolved completely and there are still uncertainties regarding the strength of the recovery. Taking these factors into account, the Committee has reiterated that it would be necessary for the monetary policy to maintain an easing bias for a long period of time. The Committee has also indicated that future rate decisions would be conditional on economic data and developments. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Hungary,2009-11-23,"Press release on the Monetary Council's meeting of 23 november 2009. At its meeting on 23 November 2009, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by 50 basis points from 7.00% to 6.50%, with effect from 24 November 2009. At its meeting, the Monetary Council also discussed the November 2009 issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation. The Council's judgement is that Hungarian growth is likely to resume in the middle of 2010 as the economy recovers from this year's sharp downturn. Inflation is expected to exceed the medium-term target temporarily due to the indirect tax increases, and then to move materially below it in the second half of next year. Conditions in the global financial system have improved gradually over the past few months, reflecting the buoyancy of the global economic outlook; however, some uncertainty about the sustainability of these developments remains. The Hungarian economic scene has been dominated by a sharp contraction in domestic demand and signs of a pick-up in economic activity abroad. In response to the deterioration in the labour market outlook and declining lending activity, households have scaled back consumption spending and companies have postponed investment plans and run down their stocks. The faster-than-expected recovery in external demand has only been sufficient to slow the pace of decline in GDP. The fall in domestic demand, largely due to the above adjustment process, and the pick-up in economic activity abroad have resulted in a considerable reduction in the country' external financing requirement. The outcomes for consumer price inflation over the past few months were below expectations. Continued subdued inflation despite the indirect tax increases is attributable mainly to the restraining effect of weak demand. In the Monetary Council's view, inflation may fall substantially below the 3% target over the medium term. Recent labour market trends suggest that companies are adjusting to weak domestic and foreign demand by moderating earnings growth and sharply reducing employment. Setting wages by taking into account the protracted recession and the expected low inflation environment may help keep jobs and contribute to a faster economic recovery. The external vulnerability of the Hungarian economy may only be reduced, if a sustained improvement in external balance is achieved. Households' increased propensity to save is expected to continue to help restore external balance. Maintaining an extremely disciplined fiscal policy approach is required in order to gradually reduce the country's vulnerability to shocks and achieve the budgetary targets set by the authorities. Global risk appetite has increased significantly in recent months, which has led to a decline in yields required by investors for holding Hungarian financial assets. However, there is a risk that the pace of the recent increase in risk appetite has been faster than would be justified by the improvements in global economic fundamentals. The domestic economy continues to be vulnerable to shocks. This, together with the above risk, requires caution in policy-setting. The Monetary Council decided to reduce the central bank base rate after considering the recent developments in the economy and inflation, as well as improvements in perceptions of risk. Interest rates may be reduced further, if this does not threaten the inflation outlook and if shifts in perceptions of risks associated with the economy allow it."
Israel,2009-11-23,"23.11.2009 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for December 2009 by 0.25 percentage points, to 1 percent The Bank of Israel announces an increase of 0.25 percentage points in the interest rate for December 2009, to 1 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.2 percent in October, the middle of the range of expectations of a rise of between 0.1 percent and 0.3 percent. In the last twelve months the CPI has increased by 2.9 percent, and since the beginning of the year by 3.6 percent. Excluding the effects of seasonality and the price increases resulting from changes in tax rates and surcharges (the increase in tax on cigarettes and fuel. VAT, and the water surcharge), the annual rate of inflation from the beginning of the year to October was close to the midpoint of the inflation target range. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: From the time of the last interest rate decision, inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital market increased somewhat. In the last few days they stood at 2.5 percent, the average of the capital market expectations in the month prior to the previous decision (on 26 October). The average of forecasters' inflation expectations for the next twelve months, however, increased following the publication of the October index, from 2.4 percent to 2.6 percent. Forecasters' expectations of the Bank of Israel interest rate are on average for an increase of 0.4 percentage points in the next three months, and for a rate of 2.6 percent in a year's time. Interest rate expectations derived from the capital market are also for arising trend, with the rate a year hence at 2.3 percent. Real economic activity: National Accounts figures for the third quarter strengthen the assessment that Israel's economy is recovering from the crisis, and that the renewed growth is becoming more firmly established. The data show that GDP grew in the third quarter at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, after increasing at a rate of about 1 percent in the second quarter. The growth expresses significant recovery in all the components of demand. Private consumption increased at an annual rate of 8.9 percent, fixed investment at a rate of 23.2 percent, and exports at a rate of 21.8 percent. In addition to these impressive figures, goods and services imports surged by an exceptionally steep 61.9 percent. The 0.5 percent rise in the composite state-of-the-economy index in October reflects a steep increase in the index of exports of manufactured goods and declines in the most recent indices of the other components. The labor market and wages: The various labor market indicators taken together suggest stabilization, but uncertainty remains regarding when the rate of unemployment will begin to decline. The trend data in the Central Bureau of Statistics Manpower Survey indicate that the unemployment rate stabilized from April to July 2009, having increased markedly since July 2008. Demand for labor increased in the third quarter of 2009, after five quartersof continuous decline, but it is still considerably lower than in the third quarter of 2008. Employment Service data for September give no clear indication of a change in the negative trend. According to National Insurance Institute data, the real wage in June-August was 2.2 percent lower than in June-August 2008, and the number of employee posts was 2.6 percent lower. Health tax revenues, which provide an up-to-date indicator oftotal wage payments, were stable. Budget data: In January-October 2009 the budget deficit (excluding credit) totaled NIS 24.5 billion, compared with a balanced budget in those months in 2008. Domestic expenditure till now, however, is NIS 4.4 billion lower than the expenditure path consistent with the budget. The forecast of the budget deficit in 2009 based on performance of the budget to October is that it will be below the target of 6 percent of GDP. The foreign exchange market: In the last month the dollar strengthened against most currencies. In the period between the monetary policy discussions of 25 October and 22 November, the shekel weakened by 3.2 percentagainst the dollar, by 2.2 percent against the euro, and by 2.9 percent interms of the index of the nominal effective exchange rate vis-?-vis the currencies of Israel's trading partners (weighted by the volume of trade). The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of 25 October and 22 November, the Tel Aviv 25 index rose by 1.4 percent, and the Tel Aviv 100 index by 1.5 percent. The leading stock exchangesaround the world also recorded share price increases. The positive trend in the government bond market continued this month. Yields on unindexed 10-year Israeli government bonds declined by 0.16 percentage points, and yieldson 10-year US government bonds fell by 0.13 percentage points, to 3.36 percent, so that the yield gap between Israeli and US unindexed government bonds remained almost unchanged at 1.5 percentage points. Over the above period, yields on makam increased--the yield on twelve-month makam increased by 0.1 percentage points, and is currently 1.6 percent. The Tel-Bond 20 index increased in the period by 1.3 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 2.7 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, increased slightly, in line with the global trend in CDS spreads. The money supply: Following the decline in September, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) fell in October by 1 percent. The M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits up to one year) fell by 0.1 percent. The world economy: The recovery process continued. In the third quarter of 2009, following declines in the previous quarters. GDP grew in the US by 3.5 percent (annual rate), in the eurozone by 1.7 percent, and in Japan by 4.8 percent. Unemployment, however, continued to increase in the USand the eurozone. In the UK. GDP contracted again in the third quarter. The emerging market economies, mainly in Asia and South America, are showing rapid growth rates, led by China with an impressive 8.9 percent growth ratein the third quarter. Assessments are that rapid growth will continue in the coming quarters. Recovery is also visible in world trade. In the next few quarters growth in the Western economies is expected to be due mainly to the government support programs and the recovery of the business sector. Globally, inflation continues to be low, but at the same time fears of deflation are abating. The Fed and the ECB are starting to take steps indicating a gradual withdrawal from the non-conventional aspects of monetary policy. In some countries where the recovery has become more firmly established interest rates have been increased. Capital markets around the world recorded increases during most of the last month, following relatively steep drops at the beginning of the month. This took place against the background of theG-20 meeting in early November, in which the members agreed to maintain support until the recovery is assured, together with positive third-quarter results reported by companies and the continued improvement in economic activity. The main considerations behind the decision Inflation measured over the previous twelve months was 2.9 percent, and in the coming months is expected to be above the upper limit of the target range, although this is largely attributable to the effects of increases in tax rates andgovernment controlled prices. However, one-year-forward inflation expectations increased moderately last month, and are in the upper part of the target range, even though they incorporate expectations of increases in the interest rate in the course of the next year. The decision to increase the interest rate for December by 0.25 percentage points willhelp to establish inflation one year ahead firmly within the target range,after the effects of the non-recurring government initiated price increases have passed. National Accounts data for the third quarter indicate recovery in economic activity, reflecting a significant increase in private consumption, exports and investments. The recent increase in Israel's exports is aided by the recovery ofworld trade. Interest rates of the leading central banks around the world are low, and are expected to remain so during the coming months. That said, the Fed and the ECB have started implementing steps that point to a gradual exit from the non-conventional aspects of monetary policy. Israel's economic indicators point to a recovery, but uncertainty persists regarding its strength. Even after this increase, the interest rate in December will be at the low level of 1 percent, continuing the accommodative monetary policy that is intended to support further economic recovery, particularly in light of the prevailing uncertainty, as well as placing inflation firmly within the target range. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments, and will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives--price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. 23.11.2009 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for December 2009 by 0.25 percentage points, to 1 percent.

Malaysia,2009-11-24,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 2.00 percent. The latest indicators have continued to signal further improvements in the international economic and financial conditions. Economic activity in the advanced economies has shown broader signs of recovery, supported by the impact of the policy measures, while several regional economies have recorded positive growth in the third quarter. While these positive developments are expected to continue going into 2010, the recovery is likely to be gradual and uneven, with the outlook remaining uncertain once the effects of the policy support begin to diminish. In the domestic economy, the pace of recovery is gaining momentum. Going forward, domestic demand, particularly private consumption and public sector spending, will continue to provide support for growth. This is supported by the sustained implementation of fiscal measures, accommodative monetary policy and continued access to financing. Inflation continued to decline at a slower rate in October. The slower decline largely reflects the cumulative fall in retail fuel prices since June 2008 and the reduced pressure on food prices. Inflation is expected to turn positive in the coming months, as domestic economic conditions strengthen. In the absence of further unanticipated price adjustments and external influences, inflation is expected to remain modest in 2010. With improving domestic economic conditions and as price pressures and inflation expectations are expected to remain contained going forward, the assessment is that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate and will continue to provide support for economic activity. The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2010. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times a year. The Monetary Policy Statement will be released at 6 p.m. on the same day as the MPC meeting. Schedule of Monetary Policy Committee Meetings for 2010. Bank Negara Malaysia 24 November 2009."
Pakistan,2009-11-24,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Decision 24th November 2009 SBP's policy rate to be cut by 50 bps cursory look at key macroeconomic indicators shows substantial improvements on multiple fronts. Inflation (YoY) has fallen to. percent in October 2009 and is expected to remain in the vicinity of 1 percent by the end of current fiscal year. External current account has improved considerably, positively altering its projected trajectory. With government borrowings from the SBP remaining within the quarterly limits, the broad money (M2) has also remained contained along the projected path. The real sector is also showing signs of improvement as the large scale manufacturing (LSM) stage recovery after protracted declining phase. However close inspection of these encouraging developments together with pragmatic assessment of prevailing security situation in the country and fiscal uncertainties invite caution and further analysis. Recent month-on-month inflation changes in headline and core measures continue to be volatile and on the higher side, oscillating between. and. percent in case of the former and remaining stuck at. percent in case of the later. reassuring fact is that the number of items in the CPI basket showing higher monthly increases relative to an historical benchmark has come down significantly. However at the same time, the number of items displaying significant inflation persistence has also increased, which indicates the probable entrenchment of second round effects of inflationary process. The poor administration in the supply chain of some food items is not helpful either in positively altering inflation expectations. higher than projected fiscal deficit for FY09 has also changed some underlying assumptions for inflation outlook in FY10. In addition, the full impact of electricity and gas price adjustments, necessary part of fiscal consolidation measures, and recent resurgence of international commodity prices, on the back of early signs of global economic recovery, remains source of uncertainty for inflation outlook. Apart from influencing commodity prices, the recovering global economy is expected to revive global trade and flow of liquidity across borders, which bodes well for Pakistan's exports and private financial flows. The recent strong inflow of workers' remittances and substantially improved external current account deficit of $1. billion in the first four months of FY10 may allow Pakistan's economy to absorb the likely swelling of import bill induced by nascent domestic recovery and higher international oil prices. However the strength and sustainability of its overall balance of payments crucially depends on resumption of foreign financial flows. Of these, portfolio inflows have picked up, direct investment has fallen, and official inflows, other than IMF, remain lower compared to projections. Looking forward, the magnitude and timing of expected non-IMF foreign inflows remain uncertain and could increase the challenges of SBP's liquidity management and government's budgetary financing. Public sector's steady borrowing requirements have the potential to raise the Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the banking system. Though broadly respecting the pre-announced T-bill auction Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN targets. Ministry of Finance (MoF) has realized Rs91 billion for budgetary support against maturities of Rs37 billion in the four auctions held so far in Q2-FY10. Moreover retirement of earlier borrowings for wheat procurement has been less than expected and to some extent neutralized by fresh borrowings for other commodities like rice, sugar, and fertilizer. Moreover the credit availed by public sector enterprises continues to increase as well. Although the cumulative flow of credit to private sector during the first nineteen weeks of FY10 shows retirement of Rs3 billion, it has increased significantly in the past seven weeks (Rs92 billion). This is in consonance with the improved performance of Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) sector in the first two months of FY10;. percent growth compared to negative. percent in the corresponding period of last year. Given the expected improvement in supply of electricity and likely increase in global demand, private sector credit may increase further. Sustained increases in the private sector credit would depend on the extent of risk averseness by banks, scale of public sector's pre-emption of limited funding sources, and fresh injection of liquidity through gradual build up in NFA of the banking system. In conclusion, the overall level of risk and uncertainty in the economy has increased considerably given the present law and order situation. As consequence, the pressure on the fiscal position, especially from the financing side, has escalated and growth in the real economy is limited. Striking balance between monetary and financial stability and real economic activity has become increasingly difficult. In this perspective. SBP has decided to support the recovering real economic activity while keeping very close watch on developments concerning the macroeconomic stability in the next two months. Therefore effective 25th November, 2009, the SBP policy rate will be lowered by 50 bps to 12. percent. Page of."
Georgia,2009-11-25,"25.11.2009 The NBG Lowers its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) to 5 Percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on November 25, 2009 and decided to lower its main policy rate (the refinancing rate) to 5 percent. In accordance with the Main Directions of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Policies of the National Bank of Georgia that was approved by the Parliament of Georgia, the inflation target is set at 6 percent for the years 2010-2012. The annual rate of inflation was 3.2 percent in October and the average annual inflation currently stands at 2.2 percent. The growth rates of the gross domestic product and the expected price level have not changed significantly since the Committee's last meeting. According to the existing forecasts, year-end inflation should remain within 3-4 percent and the inflation rate for next year should stay around 6 percent. Over the last several months, an increase in deposits has been observed in the banking sector. It is expected that the existing rate of growth in deposits will remain unchanged for the remainder of the year. As a result of the increase in deposits, annual growth rates for both the M2 and M3 monetary aggregates are positive. A large amount of excess liquidity still remains in the banking system, a factor that has reduced the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Money markets interest rates have decreased sharply over the last period. On the one hand, in order to support the monetary policy transmission mechanism the National Bank of Georgia has reduced its main policy rate, on the other hand it has increased liquidity- absorbing operations through the use of certificates of deposit. The certificates of deposit represent a risk-free asset, which should aid the commercial banks in increasing their lending. The National Bank of Georgia will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on December 23, 2009."
Poland,2009-11-25,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 25 November 2009 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 24-25 November 2009 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate at 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 3.75% on an annual basis. Further signals of recovery can be observed in the world economy. After several quarters of decline, 2009 Q3 brought GDP growth in the United States and in the euro area. At the same time, a strong increase in activity has continued in the largest emerging market economies. The recovery around the world is to a large extent driven by expansionary macroeconomic policies, in particular fiscal stimulus packages. In the developed economies, however, labour market situation is still deteriorating and  despite some improvement  problems persist in the financial sector. Lending is still being reduced. The improvement in the real economy around the world is accompanied by appreciating financial assets, including emerging market economies' currencies, and commodities in the international markets. This is supported by the expansionary policy of major central banks and the ensuing global surplus liquidity. At the same time, the largest economies are still witnessing a drop in the overall price level, while core inflation remains positive. The recently released data on the Polish economy, including data on industrial output and retail sales as well as the financial results of enterprises, point to an improvement in economic activity in 2009 Q3. Yet, the unfavourable situation in the labour market persists; in particular, the unemployment rate is rising. Bank lending to the corporate sector shows further decline and low growth of loans to the household sector continues. In October 2009 annual CPI inflation decreased to 3.1%, which was mainly driven by a fall in the annual growth of food and energy prices. At the same time, core inflation net of food and energy prices remained unchanged. The persistent relatively high core inflation means that the demand weakening so far has not fully offset the increase of administered prices and the earlier exchange rate depreciation. In the Council's assessment, in the near term annual CPI inflation may temporarily increase due to the positive base effect connected with the strong drop in oil prices observed in late 2008. Yet, subsequent quarters are expected to bring a significant fall in annual CPI inflation driven mainly by negative base effects connected with the strong growth in administered prices and food prices recorded at the beginning of 2009. Low demand pressure, slower growth of labour costs and the hitherto zloty appreciation will also be conducive to inflation decrease. In turn, a decline in inflation ul.

The Council assesses the probabilities of inflation in the medium term running below or above the inflation target to be balanced. In the Council's view, the improvement in global economic activity and the previously implemented monetary policy easing support the return of the economy to the potential growth path. The Council's decisions in the coming months will take account of the incoming information on the outlook for economic growth and inflation, the situation in the financial markets in Poland and abroad, the public finance sector and zloty exchange rate developments. The Council will continue to analyse the impact of developments in the domestic interbank market on the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Poland. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts required for euro adoption in Poland."
Euroarea,2009-12-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference today. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 5 November 2009, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information also confirms the expected improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year, with euro area real GDP growth returning to positive territory in the third quarter of 2009. However, some of the factors supporting the recovery at present are of a temporary nature. The Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, recognising that the recovery process is likely to be uneven and that the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit growth continues to slow down. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At today's meeting we also decided to continue conducting our main refinancing operations (MROs) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as is needed  and at least until the third maintenance period of 2010 ends on 13 April. We will continue to use this tender procedure in our special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue for at least the first three maintenance periods of 2010. Moreover, we decided that the rate in the last 12-month longer-term refinancing operation, to be allotted on 16 December 2009, will be fixed at the average minimum bid rate of the MROs over the life of this operation. Finally, as regards longer-term refinancing operations in the first quarter of 2010, we decided to carry out the last six-month longer-term refinancing operation on 31 March 2010. This operation will be carried out using a full allotment fixed rate tender procedure, as will the regular monthly three-month longer-term refinancing operations already announced for the first quarter of 2010. Further operational details on these decisions can be found in a press release that will be posted on our website after this press conference. The improved conditions in financial markets have indicated that not all our liquidity measures are needed to the same extent as in the past. With these decisions, the Eurosystem continues to provide liquidity support to the banking system of the euro area for an extended period at very favourable conditions and to facilitate the provision of credit to the euro area economy. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Economic activity in the euro area improved further in the third quarter of 2009, with real GDP growth returning to positive territory following five quarters of contraction. According to Eurostat's first estimate, real GDP increased by 0.4 % quarter on quarter. Available survey data suggest that the recovery is continuing during the fourth quarter of 2009. At present, the euro area is benefiting from the inventory cycle and a recovery in exports, as well as from the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. However, a number of the supporting factors are of a temporary nature and activity is likely to be affected for some time to come by the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and the non-financial sector, both inside and outside the euro area. For this reason, the euro area economy is expected to grow only at a moderate pace in 2010, and the recovery process is likely to be uneven. Eurosystem staff project annual real GDP growth of between -4.1% and -3.9% in 2009, between +0.1% and +1.5% in 2010, and between +0.2% and +2.2% in 2011. The range for 2010 has been revised upwards compared with the September 2009 ECB staff macroeconomic projections. Forecasts by international organisations are broadly in line with the December 2009 Eurosystem staff projections. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to this outlook as broadly balanced. On the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus being provided and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve further and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected. On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector, renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disruptive market movements related to the correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, as expected, euro area annual HICP inflation has turned positive again after five months of negative rates. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, it stood at +0.6% in November, up from -0.1% in October. The rise mainly reflects upward base effects stemming from the drop in global commodity prices a year ago. Inflation is expected to rise further in the near term, mainly owing to upward base effects in the energy and food components. Looking further ahead, inflation is expected to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon, with overall price, cost and wage developments staying subdued in line with a slow recovery in demand in the euro area and elsewhere. In this context, it is important to re-emphasise that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Consistent with this assessment, the December 2009 Eurosystem staff projections foresee annual HICP inflation of 0.3% in 2009, between 0.9% and 1.7% in 2010, and between 0.8% and 2.0% in 2011. Compared with the September 2009 ECB staff projections, the inflation projections for 2010 remain largely unchanged. Available forecasts from international organisations provide a broadly similar picture. They relate, in particular, to the outlook for economic activity and the evolution of commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be stronger than currently expected owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Turning to the monetary analysis, the data for October confirm the ongoing decline in the annual growth rates of M3 and loans to the private sector, to 0.3% and -0.8% respectively. These concurrent declines continue to support the assessment of a moderate underlying pace of monetary expansion and low inflationary pressures over the medium term. At the same time, the annual growth rate of M1 was 11.8% in October 2009, down from 12.8% in September, mainly reflecting a base effect. The current decline in the annual growth rates of monetary aggregates is influenced by a number of special factors and is thereby likely to overstate the deceleration in the underlying pace of monetary expansion. First, base effects associated with the intensification of the financial turmoil in autumn 2008 have had a downward effect on the annual growth rate of M3 in the past two months. Second, and more fundamentally, the steep slope of the yield curve provides an incentive to shift funds out of M3 into longer-term deposits and securities, thereby dampening M3 growth. The current constellation of interest rates also continues to trigger shifts of funds within M3, as the narrow spread between the rates on different short-term deposits reduces the opportunity costs of holding the most liquid assets contained in M1. The annual growth rate of bank loans to the non-financial private sector turned somewhat more negative in October. In the case of loans to households, the latest data provide further confirmation of a levelling-off at low rates of growth. As regards loans to non-financial corporations, it is worthwhile to note that the growth of loans to enterprises typically picks up with some lag compared with the cycle in economic activity. In this respect, the still subdued levels of production and trade, as well as the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the business outlook, are likely to dampen firms' demand for bank financing also in the coming months, especially for short-term loans. At the same time, overall financing conditions continue to improve, which should support the demand for loans in the period ahead. Banks are currently faced with the challenge of managing the size and structure of their overall balance sheets, and at the same time ensuring the availability of credit to the non-financial sector. Against the background of their improved liquidity situation and access to market financing, banks should address this challenge by taking appropriate measures to strengthen further their capital bases and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 5 November 2009, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information also confirms the expected improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year, with euro area real GDP growth returning to positive territory in the third quarter of 2009. However, some of the factors supporting the recovery at present are of a temporary nature. The Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, recognising that the recovery process is likely to be uneven and that the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty. Cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit growth continues to slow down. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. With all the measures we have taken in response to the intensification of the financial crisis, we have supported both the availability of liquidity to the banking sector and the recovery of the euro area economy. As the transmission of monetary policy works with lags, we expect that our policy action will continue to progressively feed through to the economy. We will continue our enhanced credit support to the banking system, while taking into account the ongoing improvement in financial market conditions and avoiding distortions associated with maintaining non-standard measures for too long. Looking ahead, the Governing Council will gradually phase out, at the appropriate time, the extraordinary liquidity measures that are not needed to the same extent as in the past. In order to counter effectively any threat to price stability over the medium to longer term, the liquidity provided will be absorbed when necessary. In this way, the Governing Council will continue to ensure a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. Such anchoring is indispensable to supporting sustainable growth and employment and contributing to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. As regards fiscal policies, we re-emphasise how important it is for governments to develop, communicate and implement ambitious fiscal consolidation strategies in a timely manner. These strategies must be based on realistic output growth assumptions and focus on structural expenditure reforms, not least with a view to coping with the budgetary burden associated with an ageing population. As agreed by the ECOFIN Council on 2 December 2009, governments need to set out concrete and quantifiable adjustment measures that will lead to a sustainable correction of fiscal imbalances. Several countries will have to start consolidation in 2010, and all others in 2011 at the latest. With regard to structural reforms, most estimates indicate that the financial crisis has reduced the productive capacity of our economies, and will continue to do so for some time to come. In order to support sustainable growth and employment, labour market flexibility and more effective incentives to work will be needed. Furthermore, policies that enhance competition and innovation are also urgently needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create new business opportunities. An appropriate restructuring of the banking sector should also play an important role. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management, and transparent as well as robust business models are key to strengthening banks' resilience to shocks, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and financial stability."
South Korea,2009-12-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (2.00%) for the intermeeting period. Domestic economic activity has continued on a recovering trend thanks to the progress of global economic situation. Exports and consumption have continued to improve. There still, however, remains uncertainty as to the economic growth path. Consumer price inflation has accelerated somewhat, but seems likely to remain generally stable. The upward trend of real estate prices has slowed. Financial market price variables such as exchange rates and stock prices have shown generally stable movements but their volatility heightened somewhat at one stage under the influence of international financial market unrest. The mortgage lending has grown on a similar scale to last month. Looking ahead, the Committee will maintain the accommodative policy stance for the time being with an emphasis on sustaining the recovery of business activity."
Chile,2009-12-15,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 15 December 2009 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50% (annual). Internationally, recent data confirm global activity prospects for next year, which have had an incidence in a progressive stabilization of financial markets. Commodity prices have shown mixed movements. Domestically, available information suggests that output and demand are expanding in the second half. Employment has grown and the unemployment rate has begun to decrease. Lending conditions have improved in the margin, but are still tight. In November. CPI inflation and the various core measures declined. Wage dynamics continued to be in line with historical patterns. Reduced y-o-y inflation rates are foreseen for the coming quarters. Medium-term inflation expectations have remained stable. The Board estimates that the macroeconomic environment is consistent with a monetary policy interest rate that will be held at its minimum level of 0.50% at least until the second quarter of next year, and that the pace of normalization will be comparable to expectations contained in the monthly survey, and more gradual than the one implicit in financial asset prices. Accordingly, it reiterates that it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected annual inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2009-12-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR DECEMBER 2009 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 1.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference interest rate at 1.25 percent. This decision is based on the sustained reduction of annual inflation and on the continuous reduction of inflation expectations. Inflation in November showed a rate of -0.11 percent as a result of the decline of the prices of some foodstuffs. Annual inflation has continued to decline, in line with the forecasts of our September Inflation Report. Advanced indicators of economic activity show signs of recovery more clearly, but no signals of inflationary pressures are observed in the short term. Thus, the rate of inflation in the next months should continue to be below the lower band of the target range due to the reversal of the supply shocks recorded last year. Unless important changes were to be observed in inflation forecasts and in inflation determinants, no new adjustments of the reference rate are foreseen. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 2.05 percent. Overnight deposits: 0.45 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the next month on its session of January 7, 2010."
Philippines,2009-12-16,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates steady at 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its view that current monetary policy settings remain appropriate. Latest inflation forecasts continue to be within the target ranges of 2.5-4.5 percent for 2009 and 3.5-5.5 percent for 2010, with underlying demand and supply pressures generally muted. The favorable inflation outlook reflects the moderate growth of the domestic economy in 2009 and 2010. The recovery of the global economy may also take longer than expected as significant weaknesses linger. Forward-looking indicators show that inflation expectations are well contained while the relatively firm peso could temper price pressures in the near term. The Board noted that, given the favorable inflation outlook, keeping policy rates unchanged could also encourage further investment and borrowing activity. Moving forward, the BSP will closely monitor risks to the inflation outlook, including a possible upsurge in oil and other commodity prices. The BSP also reiterates its support for non-monetary measures to address supply-side risks to consumer prices and shall continue with its periodic review of policy settings in light of its mandate to safeguard price stability."
United States,2009-12-16,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November suggests that economic activity has continued to pick up and that the deterioration in the labor market is abating. The housing sector has shown some signs of improvement over recent months. Household spending appears to be expanding at a moderate rate, though it remains constrained by a weak labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower pace, and remain reluctant to add to payrolls; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Financial market conditions have become more supportive of economic growth. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability. With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. In order to promote a smooth transition in markets, the Committee is gradually slowing the pace of these purchases, and it anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010. The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. In light of ongoing improvements in the functioning of financial markets, the Committee and the Board of Governors anticipate that most of the Federal Reserve's special liquidity facilities will expire on February 1, 2010, consistent with the Federal Reserve's announcement of June 25, 2009. These facilities include the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities Lending Facility. The Federal Reserve will also be working with its central bank counterparties to close its temporary liquidity swap arrangements by February 1. The Federal Reserve expects that amounts provided under the Term Auction Facility will continue to be scaled back in early 2010. The anticipated expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain set at June 30, 2010, for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and March 31, 2010, for loans backed by all other types of collateral. The Federal Reserve is prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke.

Therefore, resource utilization, hence inflation, is expected to stay around low levels in the medium term. The Committee has stated that strong base effects would be observed in forthcoming periods. This would lead to a significant increase in annual inflation, especially in December, yet core inflation would remain at low levels. The Committee notes that the cumulative policy rate cuts implemented since November 2008 and the improvements in global risk perceptions have started to exert favorable effects on credit markets. However, lingering problems across the global economy are not resolved completely and there are still uncertainties regarding the strength of the recovery. Accordingly, in line with the policy stance presented in the Inflation Report, the Committee has emphasized that it would be necessary to keep policy rates at low levels for a long period of time. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Hungary,2009-12-21,"At its meeting on 21 December 2009, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by 25 basis points from 6.50% to 6.25%, with effect from 22 December 2009. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian growth is likely to resume in the middle of 2010 as the economy recovers from this year's sharp downturn. Inflation is expected to remain elevated temporarily due to the tax increases, and then to move materially below the Bank's 3% target in the second half of next year. There has been no further increase in global risk appetite in recent months, with a considerable degree of uncertainty surrounding future developments in international financial markets. Rising activity abroad and declining demand at home continue to shape Hungarian economic performance. Prompted by the deteriorating labour market outlook, falling real incomes and the contraction of lending, households are scaling back consumption spending and companies are postponing investment plans. The output of exporting industries has recently begun to rise, owing to a rebound in external demand; however, this has only been sufficient to slow the pace of decline in GDP. Due to the weakness of domestic demand, the Hungarian economy is expected to recover with some lag compared with developed countries and the economies of Central and Eastern Europe. The country' external financing requirement has fallen considerably in response to the above adjustment process and the pick-up in economic activity abroad. The key factor driving movements in the prices of products affecting significantly the medium-term outlook for inflation has been the decline in demand. The increase in inflation in November was largely related to rises in the fuel price index, a component excluded from core inflation. The Monetary Council retains its view that inflation may fall substantially below the 3% target over the medium term. International investor sentiment and assessments of risks associated with Hungarian financial assets have both been very volatile over the recent period. Investor concerns about the sustainability of government debt in a number of countries have come to the fore. In order to reduce Hungary's high government debt and vulnerability to external shocks, it is particularly important to maintain a disciplined, long-term sustainable fiscal policy. Changes in perceptions of risks associated with the Hungarian economy have made it possible to significantly reduce the central bank base rate in recent months, in line with the outlook for inflation and growth. In the Monetary Council's judgement, the uncertainty surrounding future developments in global financial markets has allowed a smaller reduction in interest rates than in the past. In view of the above considerations, the Monetary Council decided to reduce the base rate by 25 basis points. Even if justified by the outlook for inflation and the economy, interest rates may only be reduced further if changes in perceptions of risks associated with the economy allow it."
Georgia,2009-12-23,"23.12.09 The NBG Keeps its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) unchanged at 5 Percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on December 23, 2009 and decided to keep its main policy rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 5 percent. The annual inflation rate was 2.7 percent in November and the average annual inflation stands at 1.9 percent. Current forecasts point to a 3-4 percent inflation by end-year and to a 6 percent inflation rate next year. The GDP forecast for 2009 has not changed since the previous MPC meeting standing at around -4 percent. GDP growth rate in 2010 is projected to equal 2 percent. The banking system witnessed the continuation of the deposit growth tendency. As it was expected, commercial banks increased credit operations, which led to an expansion of banks loan portfolio within last month. It is expected that in the next few months the uptrend in credit activity will be preserved. Central banks of the developed countries expect the economic recession to be over, but due to its slow nature they refrain from halting fiscal and monetary stimulus measures. Recovery in the financial markets represents a factor promoting economic growth. Forecasts of oil price hikes in the international markets, pointing in the same direction, creates inflationary pressures. The National Bank of Georgia will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on January 20, 2010."
Poland,2009-12-23,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 23 December 2009 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 22-23 December 2009 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate at 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 3.75% on an annual basis. The Council decided to introduce, beginning 1 January 2010, the discount rate on bills of exchange accepted from commercial banks for discount at the NBP. The Council set the discount rate at 4.00% on an annual basis. Released data confirm a continued recovery in the world economy, including further growth in economic activity in the United States and a slightly weaker improvement in economic conditions in the euro area than that observed in the US economy. At the same time, strong activity growth has been sustained in the largest emerging countries, which is connected with a rise in domestic demand in these economies. This recovery in activity around the world is still to a large extent driven by expansionary macroeconomic policy, including, in particular, fiscal stimulus packages. In the developed economies, however, the labour market situation  despite some improvement  remains unfavourable and problems persist in the financial sector. Lending is still being reduced. Following a period of growth in the prices of financial assets and commodities in international markets, these prices have stabilised recently. In particular, the appreciation of the currencies of many emerging countries has been halted. In the developed economies, the overall price level increased after a few months of decline. The latest data on the Polish economy, including those on industrial output and construction and assembly production, as well as economic sentiment indicators point to further improvement in economic activity. Despite some increase in the unemployment rate, the stabilisation of employment in the enterprise sector may be signalling a gradual deceleration of unfavourable labour market tendencies. Lending to the enterprise sector is still shrinking and the growth in consumer and housing loans to the household sector remains considerably lower than in previous years. In November 2009, the annual CPI rate rose to 3.3%, which was primarily connected with an increase in the annual growth rate of food and energy prices. At the same time, core inflation net of food and energy prices decreased, although it remained at a relatively high level. The continuation ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, of a relatively high level of core inflation means that the demand weakening so far has not fully offset the increase of administered prices and the effects of earlier exchange rate depreciation. According to the Council's assessment, in the coming period the annual CPI level may increase temporarily, considering the positive base effect connected with a strong decline in fuel prices at the end of 2008. In the following quarters, however, a significant slide is expected in the annual CPI growth rate, which will primarily be driven by the negative base effects connected with a surge in administered prices and food prices at the beginning of 2009. Other factors conducive to lower inflation include: low demand pressure, reduced growth of labour costs and earlier zloty appreciation. On the other hand, an inflation decrease in 2010 may be curbed by commodity price rises in the world markets and by increases of tax rates and administered prices. The Council assesses the probabilities of inflation in the medium term running below or above the inflation target to be balanced. In the Council's view, the improvement in global economic activity and the previously implemented monetary policy easing support the return of the economy to the potential growth path. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts required for euro adoption in Poland. Moreover, the Monetary Policy Council has approved the Financial Plan of the National Bank of Poland for 2010 and has passed a resolution amending the resolution on accounting practices, on the layout of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and of the profit and loss account of the National Bank of Poland."
Egypt,2009-12-24,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release December 24, 2009 In its meeting held on December 24, 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 825 percent and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 85 percen. Annual headline CPI inflation remained largely unchanged at 133 percent in November 2009, reflecting the accumulated sharp acceleration in the prices of fruits and vegetables that had occurred between February and October 2009, which has accounted for more than 50 percent of the annual headline inflatio. On a monthly basis, headline CPI declined by 01 percent (m/m) in November 2009 compared to the strong monthly increase of 22 percent witnessed in October 2009, marking the first negative reading since December 200. In the meantime, annual core inflation registered 66 percent in November 2009 compared to 65 percent in October and remains within the CBE's comfort zon. It is important to underscore that the December inflation outturn is expected to reflect unfavorable base effects from last year, which has already been factored into the CBE's assessment of the monetary policy stanc. Meanwhile annual real GDP growth recorded 49 percent in 2009/10 Q1 compared to the four year low of 41 percent witnessed in 2008/09 Q2. While this outturn remains below the 7 percent average registered over the past three years, it reflects a steady improvement in economic activit. There are encouraging signs that the global slowdown has stabilized somewhat over recent months and the outlook for the international economy appears to have improved as wel. This coupled, with the domestic fiscal and monetary measures undertaken so far will continue to provide a conducive environment for the domestic econom. Against this background, the MPC assesses that the current level of policy interest rate is appropriate and supportive of the economic recovery while consistent with maintaining core inflation within the CBE's comfort zone in the medium-ter. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Division Chief.

Israel,2009-12-28,"28.12.2009 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for January 2010 The Bank of Israel announces an increase of 0.25 percentage points in the interest rate for January 2010, to 1.25 percent Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.3 percent in November, the middle of the range of forecasters' expectations. Over the past twelve months, the CPI has risen by 3.8 percent, of which 1.2 percentage points can be attributed to the price increases resulting from changes in tax rates and surcharges, so that inflation in the last twelve months excluding those factors was 2.6 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Forecasters' expectations for changes in the CPI in the next three months average +0.3 percent for December, -0.2 percent for January, and 0 percent for February. Theirexpectations, on average, are that inflation in 2009 will be 4.2 percent, and their expectations for the next twelve months average 2.7 percent. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital market have averaged 2.5 percent since the last interest rate decision. Forecasters' expectations of the Bank of Israel interest rate are on average for an increase of 0.1 percentage points in the rate for January, and for a rate of 2.8 percent in a year's time. Interest rate expectations derived from the capital market are that the rate a year hence will be 3 percent. Real economic activity: According to most indicators, economic activity continues to expand. Initial findings from the Bank of Israel's Companies Survey for the fourth quarter suggest that the overall net balance for the business sector was positive, after five quarters of negative (or notstatistically significant positive) net balances. The composite state-of-the-economy index for November rose by 0.6 percent, due mainly to an increase in manufacturing production, trade and services revenue and goods imports (imports of production inputs and consumer goods). Goods and services exports, however, declined, following their steep increase in October. The risein the overall index this month is the eighth consecutive one, providing evidence of the continued improvement in economic activity. The labor market and wages: The various labor market indicators taken together suggest an improvement. Initial indications from the Central Bureau of Statistics Manpower Survey for the third quarter indicate that the unemployment rate declined to 7.8 percent, from 8 percent in the second quarter. Initial data from the Ministry of Industry. Trade and Labor Employers Survey for the fourth quarter point to a marked improvement in the balance of employment (vacancies filled minus terminations of employment): for the first time in a year there was a positive balance of 23,200 posts, compared with a negative balance of 6,200 in the third quarter. According to National Insurance Institute data, the real wage in the third quarter was 0.3 percent lower than in the second quarter, while the nominal wage increased by 1.6 percent. The upward trend in health tax revenues evident since July continued and even steepened in October. Budget data: Assuming full expenditure of the budget in 2009, thedeficit is expected to be about 5 percent of GDP, about one percentage point lower than the deficit ceiling set by law. The foreign exchange market: In the last month the dollar strengthened against most currencies, as it did in the previous month. In the period between the monetary policy discussions of 22 November and 27 December, the shekel strengthened by 0.3 percent against the dollar, by 3.7 percent against the euro, and by 2.1 percent in terms of the index of the nominal effective exchange rate vis-?-vis the currencies of Israel's trading partners (weighted by the volume of trade). The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of 22 November and 27 December, the Tel Aviv 25 index rose by 6.4 percent, and the Tel Aviv 100 index by 6.1 percent. The leading stock exchanges around the world also recorded share price increases. Following the downgrade of the credit ratings of several countries, the yield on government bonds increased this month. Yields on unindexed 10-year Israeli government bonds increased by about 40 basis points (b.p.), and yields on 10-year US government bonds by 60 b.p., to 3.84 percent, so that the yield gap between Israeli and US unindexed government bonds narrowed to 143 b.p. Over the aboveperiod, yields on makam increased--the yield on twelve-month makam increased by 30 b.p., and is currently 1.94 percent. The Tel-Bond 20 index declined in the period by 2.2 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 1.8 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, increased by 14 b.p. to 1.31 percent, following the downgrading of Greece's credit rating, but in the last few days it declined again to 1.24 percent. The money supply: After declining by 1.7 percent in October, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased in November by 0.8 percent. The M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed depositsup to one year) fell by 0.5 percent in November, continuing the decline ofthe last few months. The world economy: Macroeconomic data generally continued to paint a positive picture this month: improvements were recorded with regard to labor markets, production and growth in economies around the world, as wellas the start of the process of replenishing stocks. Against this background, the growth forecasts of many countries were revised upwards. Some of thegrowth, however, was based on the significant fiscal expansion that among other things incurred increased government debt. With the easing of the crisis, there is increased concern over the debt repayment ability of several countries, and this led to reductions in their credit ratings and rating outlooks. The press releases relating to the Fed interest rate decision explained its strategy for exiting from the unconventional aspects of its accommodative monetary policy during the crisis. The exit will apparently be passive, and will be expressed by the non-renewal of auction facilities when they expire. In the UK, however, an increase in asset purchases was announced. In Australia and Norway, which were affected relatively slightly by the crisis, the central banks increased the rate of interest again this month. Despite signs of economic recovery and some increase in inflation expectations, the major central banks continue to expect that inflation will remain moderate, in light of wide output gaps. In some countries, for example Japan, there is concern over deflation. However, rising food prices cause concern regarding inflation in the emerging market economies. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to increase the interest rate for January was taken in light of the inflation environment in Israel which is in the upper part of the price stability range, against the background of growth that is becoming more firmly based and the increase in prices of assets, including housing. Nevertheless, even after this increase in the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. This increase in the interest rate is part of a gradual process of returning interest to a normal level; the path of the return will be determined in accordance with the degree of firmness of growth, both global and in Israel, the rate at which the major central banks increase their interest rates, and the inflation environment. Inflation measured over the previous twelve months was 3.8 percent, and excluding the effects of increases in taxes and in government controlled prices, it was 2.6 percent. One-year-forward inflation expectations are slightly below the upper limit of the target range; these are accompanied by expectations of increases in the interest rate next year. Recent economic indicators in Israel show that the economy is firmly on the path out of the recession. Thus, initial indications from the Companies Survey show increased activity; Manpower Survey data point to some decline in unemployment; it can be seen from foreign trade data that manufacturing exports are on a rising trend; and manufacturing production and revenue data also show an improvement. The global economy is also exhibiting clearer signs of recovery from the crisis, including the increase in world trade. Uncertainty persists, however, regarding the rate of recovery of the global economy, a factor that contributes to uncertainty about Israel's economic recovery. Interest rates of the leading central banks around the world are low, and are expectedto remain so during the coming months, alongside a gradual exit from the non-conventional aspects of their expansionary monetary policies. An increase in the rate of interest by the Bank of Israel is likely to have some effect on the exchange rate of the shekel against other currencies. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic and financial developments, and will use the instruments available to itto achieve its objectives--price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system. 28.12.2009 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for January 2010 The Bank of Israel announces an increase of 0.25 percentage points in the interest rate for January 2010, to 1.25 percent.
