Chile,2004-01-08,"The Central Bank of Chile PRESS RELEASE* 8 January 2004 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to reduce the monetary policy interest rate from 2.25% to 1.75% (annual). News from the cost and price side reveals lower than expected inflationary pressures. The 12-month inflation rate is around 1%, and negative rates are expected for some months of the first half of the year. Also, the core inflation CPIX, that excludes the prices of some more volatile goods, is at 2% annual, and is expected to be below 1% in the same period. These low inflation levels increase the risk of future pricing decisions being based on inflationary expectations inconsistent with the Central Bank's inflation target, thus postponing the convergence of inflation rates to the 3% target in the usual 24- month policy horizon. In this setting, the reduction of the interest rate reduces this risk. Regarding economic activity, recent information suggests an increase in growth projections for the coming quarters. This is due to both external and domestic factors. Terms of trade continue to improve, especially the price of copper, world growth expected for this year has consolidated, and good international financial conditions continue. Domestically, consumer expectations are more optimistic, in a scenario where employment and household loans continue to grow, which adds to the expansionary monetary policy. The Central Bank of Chile reassures its objective of attaining an inflation rate centered around 3% in the usual policy horizon, and reiterates that it will continue to conduct monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to address any projected inflation deviations in either direction from the specified target inflation rate."
Euroarea,2004-01-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first press conference of 2004. Let me express the Vice-President's and my own best wishes to you all for the New Year. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the President of the ECOFIN Council. Mr McCreevy, and Commissioner Solbes. Following our regular economic and monetary analysis, we continue to judge the current stance of monetary policy as appropriate to preserve price stability over the medium term. Accordingly, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged at their low levels. The available indicators point to an ongoing economic recovery in the euro area. Although recent exchange rate developments are likely to have some dampening effects on exports, export growth should continue to benefit from the dynamic expansion of the world economy. Import price developments in the euro area should become somewhat more favourable, thereby helping to contain inflationary risks. We will continue to carefully monitor all developments that could affect our assessment of risks to price stability over the medium term. Starting with the economic analysis, recently available indicators confirm that world economic growth is progressing. For the euro area too, the latest information on production and confidence is consistent with an ongoing recovery in economic activity, and the momentum for growth should strengthen in the course of 2004. This assessment is supported by all available forecasts from official and private sources, as well as by developments in the financial markets. On the external side, recent exchange rate developments are having a negative impact on the price competitiveness of euro area exporters, but thus far this should be partly compensated for by the ongoing expansion of global demand. On the domestic side, investment growth should benefit from the ongoing adjustment efforts of firms to enhance productivity and profitability, as well as from the low level of interest rates and generally favourable financing conditions. Private consumption should receive support from real disposable income growth, partly due to favourable effects on terms of trade and inflation stemming from the past appreciation of the euro. Over longer horizons, the uncertainties continue to be related to persistent external imbalances in some regions of the world and their potential repercussions on the sustainability of global economic growth. This is a challenge to be addressed by sustainable macroeconomic policies and structural reforms which foster a sound balance between savings and investment in all major partner countries, enhance the production potential in the euro area and support a further expansion in trade of goods and services at the global level. With regard to price developments. HICP inflation rates over the short term are still expected to fluctuate around the 2% level, following a rate of 2.1% in December, according to Eurostat's flash estimate. As I have explained on previous occasions, adverse food price developments, the evolution of oil prices and increases in indirect taxes and administered prices have all adversely affected the short-term outlook for inflation. However, in the course of this year we expect inflation rates to fall and to remain in line with price stability thereafter. This expectation is based on the assumption that wage developments will remain moderate in the context of a gradual economic recovery. Moreover, the past appreciation of the euro should dampen price pressures. These views are also reflected in the available forecasts and projections. We are, of course, fully aware of the conditional nature of these forward-looking exercises and therefore bear in mind all elements of risk to the outlook for price stability. In the same vein, we continue to closely monitor inflation expectations. Turning to the monetary analysis, the strong monetary growth of the last few years means that there is significantly more liquidity available in the euro area than needed to finance non-inflationary growth. At the same time, the growth of loans to the private sector has been rising over recent months, benefiting from the low level of interest rates and the general improvement in the economic environment. In our view, the accumulation of excess liquidity should not be of concern for price stability as long as the economic recovery is gradual. However, should excess liquidity remain high once there is a significant strengthening of economic activity, it could lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term. We will therefore carefully examine monetary developments as they unfold. In summary, the economic analysis continues to indicate that the main scenario for price developments in the medium term is in line with price stability. This picture is confirmed by cross-checking with the monetary analysis. Concerning fiscal policies, 2004 will be a crucial year for strengthening the credibility of the institutional framework and confidence in the soundness of public finances of Member States across the euro area. Together with the Treaty provisions, the overall fiscal framework of the Stability and Growth Pact remains of central importance and must be fully respected. These are the foundations for trust and confidence in EMU. They are key not only to stability but also to growth, and are a precondition for preserving low risk premia in financial markets. We therefore strongly urge governments and the ECOFIN Council to live up to their responsibilities and to the commitments they made last November. Finally, the Governing Council strongly supports ongoing efforts by a number of governments to proceed with structural reforms  in the fiscal domain, and in labour and product markets. Building on what has already been implemented, further reforms are required to make the euro area economy more flexible, to allow a better allocation and utilisation of capital and human resources, and to enhance the euro area's growth potential. The process of structural reform would be greatly enhanced if social partners were to fully commit themselves to the objective of making the euro area a more dynamic, innovative and competitive economy. Such common efforts should help to better communicate to the public the benefits of effectively responding to the main challenges of the euro area: bringing down the high level of structural unemployment, enhancing the production potential, increasing productivity, reducing the inefficiencies of the tax system as well as preparing the health and pension systems for the ageing of the population."
South Korea,2004-01-08,"Despite the continuing sluggishness of private consumption and facilities investment, industrial production has exhibited solid growth mainly owing to strong exports. Overall, the real economy continues to show signs of gradual improvement. Consumer price inflation accelerated temporarily in December, as prices of industrial products and private services rose. Fundamentally, however, inflation has remained stable and housing prices have also continued to decline since the previous month. The current account is estimated to have maintained its relatively large surplus, owing to the continued surplus on the goods account. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions have been relatively favorable due to the low demand for funds. However, concern over the deterioration of the soundness of some financial institutions - notably a few credit card companies - has grown and risk aversion from low-rated corporations has not lessened. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.75 percent) for the intermeeting period."
Peru,2004-01-08,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR JANUARY 2004 In December, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima rise 0,56 percent mainly due to increased of foodstuffs prices like potatoes and rice. The annual inflation rate for 2003 was in its target (2,5 percent). Core inflation, an indicator which excludes high volatility items from the CPI basket, was 0,30 percent in December. The average interbank interest rate was 2,51 percent in December, slightly lower to the rate recorded in the previous month (2,55 percent). In 2003 there were 4 reductions of the monetary policy's references rates, that induced diminutions of 25 basis points in the interbank rate in 3 occasions (July. September and November) and one of 50 basis points (August). The monetary policy's decisions are based on inflation forecasts and have like goal to anticipate rise or loss pressures in prices growth. Central Bank´s August inflation report forecasted a 2004 inflation within the lower band of the range (1,5  2,5 percent). The Board of the Bank approved to maintain in January borrowing and lending interest rates for Central Bank operations at: 3,25 percent: for monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchases of BCR's securities. 1,75 percent: for commercial banks' overnight deposits at the BCR. The monetary operations of injection and retirement of liquidity by auctions will be oriented to obtain that the interbank interest rate is in the middle of the range of reference interest rates (2,50 percent). The interest rate for rediscount operations and direct temporary purchase of securities will be the interbank market interest rate, when this one be higher than 3,25 percent. For January, the estimated range for commercial banks' current account balances held at the Central Bank is 170 million to 190 million, on a daily basis. The level of this average balance is not a goal, nor an indicator of the degree of flexibility of the monetary policy, because it reflects additionally seasonal factors and movements in the demand of liquidity. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be the 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission is maintained at an implicit effective annual cost of 3,25 percent. The chronogram of the sessions in which the Board will approve the Monthly Monetary Program is the following: February 5th March 4th April 7th May 6th June 3rd July 8th August 5th September 9th October 7th November 4th December 9th The Central Bank will issue its Inflation Report in the following dates: February 6th June 4th September 10th."
Philippines,2004-01-14,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. During its review of the prevailing macroeconomic and financial conditions, the Monetary Board noted that the expected path for headline inflation over the BSP's policy horizon continues to be favorable. Headline inflation is expected to see a moderate rise in 2004 to 4-5 percent, in line with government inflation targets and consistent with a projected rise in output growth, improvements in aggregate demand, and cost-push influence of planned adjustments in import tariff rates and utility charges. At the same time, the inflation outlook also considers the risks stemming from concerns over domestic political conditions, which may influence the movements of the exchange rate and financial variables with potential inflationary effects. The Monetary Board acknowledges also that the modest pace of money and credit demand as well as the generally uneven character of the trends in other economic indicators could pose downside risks for the overall strength of economic activity. However, apart from continued spare capacity in manufacturing, the sizeable stock of non-performing loans of the banking system has contributed to the subdued lending activity. Moreover, the possibility of disorderly adjustments in the foreign exchange market due to political developments and shifts in market sentiment suggest the need for caution in deciding on the monetary policy stance. Thus, in weighing the prospective balance of risks, the Monetary Board believes that the current monetary policy stance is appropriately supportive of the economy's growth objective. The Monetary Board is also of the view that the present monetary policy settings would continue to ensure adequate liquidity to support growth in domestic demand while helping guard against potential price risks. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to review the BSP's monetary policy stance on 12 February 2004."
Poland,2004-01-21,"Warsaw, 21 January 2004 INFORMATION FROM A MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 20-21 January 2004 At its first meeting in 2004, the Monetary Policy Council analysed trends emerging in the economy in 2003 which could be of material importance for the inflation level in 2004 and 2005. It was observed that: Following its drop to 0.3% reported in April 2003, a gradual growth of the CPI can be observed accompanied by a growth of base inflation indicators. In December 2003, twelve-month inflation reached 1.7%, thus remaining in line with the goal predicted in the Medium-Term Monetary Policy Strategy, 1999  2003, which forecast that inflation would fall below 4.0% by the end of 2003 and was slightly below the short-term inflationary goal set for 2003 (3% +/- 1pct. point). Real inflation, which was 0.3% below the bottom limit of the inflationary goal bracket, was reached in the conditions of a planned accelerated growth rate of foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages (2.1%), nevertheless markedly lower than the expected growth in the group of goods and services with controlled prices (2.3%). A 3.6% - 4.8% growth in controlled prices was planned on the grounds of available information on the assumptions underlying the draft budget act for 2003. In real terms, a shift of the effect of increased excise tax on final prices of goods and services remained below the forecast, while the growth in prices of base power carriers, including electricity and heating, was lower than expected. Similarly, a gradual increase in the PPI could be observed from August 2003 to reach 3.7% at the end of 2003 on the annual basis i.e. the highest level since the beginning of 2001. With continuously stable NBP rates since June 2003, a growth in the market rates and the yield on T-bonds was reported in the second half of 2003. In the period starting 30 June 2003 ending 30 December 2003, market interest rates WIBOR 3 M grew by 28 b.p. and WIBOR 6M grew by 53 b.p., while yield on two-year T bonds grew by 121 b.p., a yield on 5-year T-bonds grew by 169 b.p. and a yield on 10-year T-bonds grew by 139 b.p. Contrary to expectations, 2003 saw a rise in monthly average oil prices; from the lowest 2003 level of 24.9 USD/b in April to reach 29.9 USD/b in December 2003, i.e. a rise of 19.9%; The PLN/EUR exchange rate (monthly average) depreciated from 4.06 in January 2003 to 4.65 in December 2003, i.e. by over 11%. *** Other economic data, which emerged since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council: I Indicates: the continuing presence of factors supporting the continuation of low inflation: Continued moderate money supply; the annual growth rate of the M3 aggregate increased by 5.5% in December 2003 against 5.7% in November. Continued moderate growth of household loans. The annual growth rate in corporate loans reached 2.9% in December 2003 against 3.8% in November, with 14.0% and 13.4% for household loans, respectively. II. Confirms: upward economic trends growing stronger, increasing inflationary pressures gradually; however, the Council does not see this, as such, as a threat to the achievement of the inflationary goal in 2004. Estimates of the Main Statistical Office indicate the GDP growth rate in the 3rd quarter 2003 at 3.9%. The NBP estimates that the GDP growth rate in the 4th quarter 2003 will remain similar or slightly above its 3rd quarter figure; in consequence. GDP growth for 2003 should exceed 3.5%. Compared to December 2002. PPI grew by 13.9% in December 2003, including a growth by 18.7% in the production of the processing industry. After seasonal trends, the rise in the PPI was 11.6% and 15.9% in the processing industry. The growth trend in production became stronger both in the processing industry (with the annual growth rate of the trend exceeding 13.7%) and the PPI (10.6%). The results of the December survey on the general condition of enterprises indicated continuing improvement in the general market trends in the processing industry. Continuing high growth of the exports with 7.0% growth of the exports denominated in EUR and 28.0% growth of the exports denominated in USD (in accordance with the payment statistics) after eleven months 2003. More optimistic forecasts for foreign demand  the USA and Japan when compared to the forecasts in December 2003. III. Nevertheless, the importance of factors adversely affecting the stabilisation of inflation at a low level remained unchanged. The Council upholds its opinion that such a factor is the uncertainty with respect to the current and future condition of public finance. The medium-term prospects for public finance are obscure. The high budget deficit, the growing credit needs of the state, difficulties in iimplementing a programme for downsizing current expenditure and its effective restructuring may cause some disruptions on financial markets leading to an increase in the yield on treasury securities and depreciation of the zloty exchange rate. Against this background, the Council re-emphasises the necessity for in-depth, swift and effective reforms leading to recovery of the public finance to prevent public debt build-up and a debt loop. Abandonment of some in-depth changes in 2004 resulting in a long-term recovery of public finance would swiftly bring the debt closer to the limit set out in the Constitution, thus preventing rapid economic growth and reduction in unemployment levels. 2 Current estimates of the NBP indicate that, in 2003, public debt exceeded 50% of the GDP, i.e. was higher than the first prudential threshold and it is likely to exceed the second prudential threshold i.e. 55% of the GDP in 2004. IV. Other possible factors creating inflationary pressure include: a high growth rate of cash in circulation. In December 2003, the annual growth rate of the aggregate reached 17.1% (and 18.2% in September). A possible increase in oil prices. In January 2004, the forecast annual average oil price in 2004 rose from 27.9 USD/b. to 28.3 USD/b. A possible significant increase in the prices of foodstuffs in 2004 indicated by current forecasts. A distinct deterioration in inflationary expectations. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council: After a discussion, the Monetary Policy Council resolved to leave the monetary policy parameters unchanged and maintain its neutral approach to monetary policy The next meeting of the Council is scheduled for 24-25 February 2004 3 External factors December 2003 saw a consolidation of revival signals in the global economy; in particular, growth ratios in the USA economy improved. A strong domestic demand was reflected by a Stronger revival signals in the growing rate of retail trade payments and a high growth of real estate transactions accompanied global economy by a distinct PPI growth. In December 2003, current activity ratios in the euro-zone still indicated a weakness in domestic demand with no improvement in the key indexes of consumer and enterprise confidence. December 2003 showed an increasing depreciation of the dollar on the global market as had been observed for a period coming close to two years. The depreciation was the most clearly noticeable in the EUR/USD exchange rates (in December, the monthly average EUR/USD High oil prices exchange rate gained 0.6% against the rate in November 2003), the trend continues in January on global 2004. markets The average price of Brent was equal to 29.9 USD/b in December 2003, translating to a 1.1 USD increase in the price as compared to November 2003 and USD 1.4 increase as compared to the corresponding period of 2003. Oil prices continued to grow in the first days of January, exceeding 32 USD/b on 9 January 2004, which is the highest price reported since the outbreak of the Iraqi war in March 2003. The growth in oil prices is mainly caused by the continued depreciation of the dollar, the cold winter in the USA and the country's low oil reserves. At the beginning of January 2004, the Department of State for Energy increased the forecast of the annual average oil price in 2004 up to 28.3 USD/b i.e. by 0.4% beyond the projections made in December 2003. Stabilised GDP growth Economic situation in Poland In accordance with the estimations of the Main Statistical Office, the GDP growth rate in the third quarter of 2003 reached 3.9%, with a continued high rate in the increase of the added value in industry (8.2%) and a slowing of the falling trend in the construction industry (-2% against  7.4% in the second quarter of 2003). After nine quarters of consecutive fall in the gross outlay on fixed assets, the third quarter of 2003 saw their growth of 0.4%. As a growth of stock remained below the level reported a year ago, their annual gross accumulation dropped by 0.3%, with the individual consumption rate above expectations (3.4%), despite the continuingly low growth in wages and salaries. The net High growth of export input into the GDP growth remained high and positive (1.5% against 1.8% reported in receipts from the second quarter of 2003). export In November 2003, the current account deficit reached EUR 286 million dropping by EUR 470 million as compared to the corresponding period of 2002 and by EUR 3.9 billion for the period from January to November 2003 when compared to the corresponding period of 2002. As in the preceding months, a reduction of the current account deficit was caused by a decrease in the negative balance of commodity payments. November 2003 saw a drop of the balance by EUR 450 million (i.e. the largest drop since the beginning of 2001) and by EUR 2.4 billion within eleven months of 2003, which mainly stemmed from a continuing strong growing trend in the export receipts. In November 2003, their value grew by 12.1% as compared to November 2002 (the third consecutive month of double-digit growth) and by 7.0% since the beginning of 2003, concurrently to a decrease in the import debits, with their value falling by as much as by 2.2% below the level reported in November 2002 and since the beginning of 2003 lower by 0.5% than in the corresponding period of 2002. December 2003 saw a 13.9% increase in industry production as compared to December 2002. The higher industry production growth rate can be partially attributed to a higher number of working days when compared to December 2002 (one day extra) and a difference in their spread (the spread of working days in December 2003 was less favourable for making holiday decisions). A particularly high growth was reported in the processing industry (a growth of 18.7%). Data published on the sectoral structure of growth in the processing industry indicates a continuation of existing trends Again the highest growth in sales was reported in the 4 continuation of existing trends. Again, the highest growth in sales was reported in the State budget mechanical vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers production sector (49.1%). The economic groups deficit in 2003 predominately exporting their production (production of furniture, machines and equipment, lower than planned metal products, electrical machines and devices, rubber products) widened to include the production of other non-metal goods. Condition of the public finance sector In 2003, the state budget deficit reached PLN 37 billion i.e. PLN 1.7 billion (2.3%) below the amount planned in the Budget Act. As it was projected, due to lower inflation and some differences in the economic growth structure, the state budget revenue amounted to PLN 152.2 billion, remaining below the figure forecast in the Budget Act (a shortage of PLN 3.5 billion), chiefly due to a failure to be paid expected receipts in all tax categories. Due to some overoptimistic expectations as to an increase in the wages and salaries fund and employment, the highest shrinkage in receipts was reported from personal income tax (6.1%). In 2003, expenditures of the state budget were realised at PLN 189.2 billion i.e. 97.3% of the figure set forth in the Budget Act, reporting an increase of 3.4% as compared to 2002. A PLN 5.3 billion reduction in state budget expenditure was primarily caused by considerable savings on the cost of servicing the public debt, both domestic and external (by approx. PLN 3 billion) as well as unrealised conditional expenditures. 2003 state Despite the state budget result at the end of 2003 being more favourable than planned, it is public debt likely that the public finance sector deficit will be higher than that reported for 2002. In exceeding the 1st consequence of a shortage of revenue over expenditure in other public sector components, prudential including in particular the Social Security Fund and the Labour Fund, the deficit will grow to threshold approx. 5.2% of the GDP. Yet another year of continued high disequilibrium of the public finance sector led in 2003 to the first prudential threshold set forth in the Public Finance Act being exceeded. It is estimated that, at the end of 2003, the state public debt (including the expected payouts under sureties and guarantees) will reach nearly 51% of the GDP. The absence of any deep-reaching changes in the fiscal policy in 2004 and subsequent years and, primarily, moving away from the solutions listed in the Program for Creating a Clear Structure of the Public Expenditures and their Reduction will swiftly lead the debt closer to its constitutional limit. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate Figures presented in forward information indicate a PLN 3.5 billion (1%) growth in the M3 money supply against November 2003. Changes in the money supply were materially affected by the fluctuations in the price of the zloty. After the exchange rate fluctuations, the M3 aggregate grew by approx. PLN 5 billion (1.5%). The annual growth rate of M3 in December 2003 reached 5.5%. December 2003 saw a marked growth in deposits in the banking system, with corporate deposits increasing by PLN 4.6 billion (7.2%); after elimination of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, the growth was equal to PLN 4.9 billion (7.7%). At the end of 2003, the annual growth rate of corporate deposits reached 24%. Household deposits noted a growth of PLN 1.6 Low growth in billion (0.9%) and after foreign exchange fluctuations, the growth amounts to PLN 2.8 billion corporate loans (1.5%) and was mainly attributable to the movement of funds from investment funds to bank and moderate deposits. On the annual basis, household deposits dropped by 2.0%. growth in A PLN 0.4 billion (-0.8%) decrease in the cash in circulation was reported in December household loans 2003 as compared to November 2003, with the annual growth rate of the category at 17.1%. In December 2003, household loans increased by PLN 1 billion (1.0%). After foreign currency fluctuations, the category grew by PLN 1.2 billion (1.2%) and its annual growth rate reached 14% at the year-end. The upward trend in the household loans came as a consequence of a rapid growth of housing loans. Corporate loans dropped significantly in December 2003 by PLN 4.5 billion (-3.2%) i.e. PLN 3.9 billion (2.8%) after foreign exchange differences. The annual growth rate of corporate loans reached 2.9% at the end of December. In the period between the meetings of the MPC (the analysed period 1 December 2003 5 until 16 January 2004), two periods can be distinguished on the currency market: in December Zloty 2003, the zloty stabilised. In general, the stable trend in the foreign currency market came as a depreciation effect of a surplus in the current payments of the balance of payments reported in September and growth in T-bonds yield in and October, which appeared positively different from the analysts' expectations. January 2004. January 2004 and in particular the end of the analysed period, saw a rebound of the depreciation trend of the zloty resulting from diminishing trust in the possible adoption and implementation of the plan prepared by the Deputy Prime Minister. Jerzy Hausner, in its proposed form and, to a lesser degree, the influence of the Hungarian financial market. A falling trend in bond yield could be observed in December 2003. The T-bond market stabilised when informed on a markedly lower supply of treasury securities as compared to the previous assessment of market players. The prospectus for the issue of the T securities in the first quarter 2004 published at the beginning of December assumed more extensive use of foreign markets in order to finance the credit needs of the budget. In the period following 13 January, a significant cut in bond prices (growth of yield) occurred, triggered by the fears of investors connected with the ability to implement the plan for limiting public expenditure, as was also the case on the currency market. The highest growth of nearly 50 b.p. was reported for long-term T-bonds. A yield margin on a 10-year bond reflecting The annual CPI the investment risk in comparison to the euro-zone bond increased again to approx. 270 b.p. The annual PPI Prices, inflationary expectations at 3.7% In December 2003, the twelve-month CPI reached 1.7%. Compared to December 2002, the highest growth was reported due to increased prices of apartment rents (2.7%) caused predominantly by a growth in the prices of power carriers (3.3%), prices in the transport sector (2.9%) and fuel prices in particular (4.4%) as well as prices of foodstuffs and non-alcoholic Increase in beverages (2.1%), while prices of clothing and footwear remained below the level reported for inflationary December 2002. expectations December 2003 saw a stable trend in the PPI, with PPI growing by 3.7% the corresponding period of 2002, as in November 2003. A high value of the PPI as at the end of 2003 stems from continuously high prices of industrial raw materials (industrial metals, oil, coal) on global markets in 2003. In January 2004, a price growth rate expected within the next 12 months by individuals was 2.1%, i.e. 0.5% above the result indicated last month and 1.2% above the November 2003 level. According to the Ipsos survey, deterioration in general consumer confidence is caused by some fears connected with price increases after Poland joins the European Union. The NBP believes the fears to be unjustified. Another reason for the deterioration of inflationary expectations is the growth in current inflation. Similarly, in January 2004, bank analysts increased their expectations, with a predicted inflation rate of 2.6% for December 2004 i.e. 0.1% above the rate indicated in December 2003."
Thailand,2004-01-21,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 21 January 2004 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. The MPC reviewed the latest data on economic conditions in Thailand and deemed that economic growth in the first 11 months of 2003 had been strong, supported by robust domestic and external demand. Further increases in the private investment and consumption indices reflected heightened economic activity and improved confidence, supported by higher farm income on account of increases in both price and volume. Export values remained high, while the tourism growth returned to normal. External stability remained strong with the current account continuing in surplus, international reserves at a high level, and further reductions in the level of foreign debt. Internal stability remained satisfactory. Core inflation edged down to 00 per cent in December as housing rents continued to fall. For the year, core inflation averaged 02 per cent and 06 per cent if housing rents are excluded, slightly higher than the 05 per cent average in 2002 for the same measure. Headline inflation averaged 18 per cent in 2003, driven by an acceleration in raw food and energy prices. The MPC expected economic growth to continue in the foreseeable future supported by strong domestic spending and exports. With the recovery in world economic growth, external risks have receded and an important focus going forward will be on movements of major currencies and their implications. While inflation should remain low and not pose a threat to economic stability, developments in the current account, as well as potential imbalances that might occur with respect to asset prices and household balance sheets, should be monitored closely as growth continues to pick up. The MPC deemed that the current policy stance and prevailing rates of interest are appropriate for current economic conditions and, therefore, decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 125 per cent per annum."
Poland,2004-01-22,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on January 22, 2001 At the meeting held on January 22nd, 2001 the Monetary Policy Council discussed the present situation in the area of inflationary processes formation. 1. Inflation The rise of prices for consumer goods and services in December 2000 amounted to 0.2% as compared to November -as a result the 12-month price index at the end of last year decreased to 8.5% as compared to 9.8% in December 1999. The drop of non-foodstuffs prices by 0.6% mainly contributed to this situation and it mainly resulted from the drop of fuel prices by almost 7%. The services prices rose by 0.3% - a bit more than the general price index. The foodstuff prices in December rose by 1.0% as compared to November. The industrial production prices decreased by 0.8% in December 2000. As a result, the index of these prices calculated in relation to December of the previous year amounted to 5.7% as compared to 7.2% in November and 7.9% in December 1999. The slight growth in the section of industrial processing mainly contributed to this situation (by 4.8% annually as compared to 7.5% in December 1999). Such structure of the price growth is an evidence of decreasing dynamics of the domestic demand. The decrease of inflation since August 2000, however, is also the result of temporary factors the evidence of which is the slower pace of base inflation decrease than the decrease of the consumer price index. Since July to December 2000 the annual dynamics of the consumer price index decreased by 3.1 percentage points and the base inflation indices in the same period decreased by 1.2 percentage points to 2 percentage points. 2. Money In 2000, both the absolute growth of the money supply and the pace of its growth were lower than in 1999. The total money supply in 2000 rose by PLN 30.9 billion, i.e. by 11.7% (2.9% in real terms) as compared to 19.3% (8.7% in real terms) in 1999. In December last year the annual pace of growth of deposits denominated in PLN placed by individuals was still increasing and it amounted to 24.4% as compared to 22% in November last year. At the end of 1999 it was considerably smaller and amounted to only 13.2%. The dynamics of loan extension was still decreasing. The growth pace of loans extended to individuals dropped to 32% in December from 34.8% in November and 53% in December 1999. At the end of 2000, the growth pace of loans to businesses amounted to 13.4% while in November last year it amounted to 14% and at the end of 1999 21.6%. In three quarters of 2000 as compared to the same period of the previous year the Polish businesses received less by a half of funds coming from foreign loans. 3. Real sector In December last year the industrial output dropped by 1.4% as compared to November, and by 2.2% as compared to December of the previous year. As a result of considering the smaller number of business days in December 2000 as compared to December 1999, it can be estimated, however, that the industrial output in the comparable number of working hours increased. It should be also noted that there was a very dynamic growth of the industrial output in December 1999 what established a very high basis for its growth pace calculation. These data confirmed the information given earlier by GUS (the Main Office of Statistics) on the economic situation in enterprises that did not indicate material changes of the real sector situation in December. According to the enterprises, the tendency of a gradual reduction of the industrial output growth pace will be maintained (although a considerable increase of the excessive finished products inventory was not noted); the output of the construction sector was still lower than a year before, and it was noted that the retail sales dynamics was not bigger than it would result from the seasonal increase in Christmas time. The manufacturing enterprises a bit more optimistically than in November last year estimated the future economic situation what is connected with the forecasted improvement of consumer demand and -at a smaller scale -the investment demand, with the seasonal increase of expectations of the foreign demand worsening. However, there was also noted the increase of trade enterprises pessimism as far as the forecasted sales are concerned, what may be the evidence of the smaller than expected scale of sales growth in December and the maintained reduction of consumer demand growth. Within the whole year 2000, the growth pace of industrial output that amounted to 7.1% was bigger than in the previous year when it reached 4.4%. December was the next month that confirmed the tendency of the salaries dynamics decrease. Within the whole year 2000, an average gross salary in the sector of enterprises increased in nominal terms by 11.4% as compared to the previous year, what meant the increase by 1.2% in real terms. 4. Fiscal policy In December last year, there was noted the increase of the budget sector net debt in the banking system, what contributed to the decrease of this sector debt reduction scale in the whole year 2000 from PLN 19.1 billion in November to PLN 13.7 billion in December. The decrease of the budget sector debt in the banking system at the scale of the whole year mainly resulted from financing the loan needs of the budget with funds coming from the outside of the banking system -mainly with revenues from privatization. In 2000 the fiscal policy was not more restrictive than in 1999. In 2000, the budget situation worsened and the economic deficit of public finance exceeded the originally forecasted 1.7% of GDP and was at the level similar to 1999: 2.7% of GDP. The planned in the government amendment to the draft of the act on the state budget for 2001use of a considerable part of funds from the sale of the UMTS licenses for financing current expenses, with the correction of some income and expenses and the forecasted decrease of the local government sector deficit by 0.1% of GDP, will result in the increase of the forecasted economic deficit from 1.6% to 1.8% of GDP in the current year. Additionally, the planned transfers from the European Union at the amount of 0.5% of GDP (0.1% of GDP in 2000) should be taken into consideration. They should be also taken into account while evaluating the fiscal policy influence on domestic demand. Therefore, carrying out the budget assumptions means the lack of fiscal policy tightening in 2001. At the same time, the Monetary Policy Council still maintains its doubts concerning the budget draft that were expressed in the opinion of November 22nd, 2000. They were related to the better tax collection, the increase of ZUS income from the sale of debts, assumptions concerning the results of the remaining elements of the public finance sector and the possibility to increase the economic deficit with maintaining the forecasted level of the state budget deficit in case the planned funds are not transferred to the second tier of social insurance at the amount of 1.8% of GDP. In order to carry out the fiscal policy assumptions it is very important that the financial situation of ZUS in 2001 is better than in the previous year. 5. External imbalance and exchange rate In November 2000, a considerable decrease of current account deficit took place and it was at the level of USD 0.3 billion. During eleven months of 2000 it amounted to USD 9.1 billion, so in nominal terms it was smaller than in the same period of 1999 when it reached USD 9.9 billion. The decrease of the current account deficit mainly resulted from bigger revenues from export of goods and services with the stabilization of growth pace of payments for imports. During eleven months of 2000 the exports growth dynamics was bigger than the dynamics of imports growth. The USD-denominated revenues from exports within the period January -November 2000 increased by 7.0% and the same revenues denominated in the euro rose by 24.7% as compared to the same period of the previous year. The USD-denominated payments for imports in this period rose by 3.2% and the same payments denominated in the euro by 19.7%. In December 2000 the nominal appreciation of the zloty took place, both in relation to the US dollar (at the end of the month by 7.4%) and to the euro (by 0.7%). In the half of January the zloty appreciated in relation to the American currency by about 1% and it remained practically stable in relation to the euro. *** In 2000, the monetary policy target set as the consumer price index within the range between 5.4% and 6.8% was not achieved. The main factors that contributed to the inflation deviation in relation to the target were the external shocks - mainly the increase of fuel prices and the situation on foodstuff market. A serious tightening of monetary policy was necessary the purpose of which was mainly halting inflation expectations and the reduction of secondary effects of price increase due to these shocks. Thanks to this effort it was possible, with the supporting factors, to reach the drop of price increase from 11.6% in July last year to 8.5% in December 2000. At the end of 2000 a lot of phenomena that positively affected the conditions of reaching the inflation target in 2001 were noted: 1. both the growth pace of consumer goods and services and industrial output prices decreased considerably; 2. the loan dynamics weakens with the essential rise of deposit dynamics; the growth pace of money supply remains relatively low; 3. the reversal of tendencies to weaken macroeconomic bases for the economic development takes place; the improvement tendency in the area of current account deficit and inflation reduction is clearly visible. Despite these positive phenomena that are mainly connected with a restrictive monetary policy in 2000, the Monetary Policy Council did not notice satisfactory factors to reduce interest rates. Before making such a decision, the Council has to be sure enough that regaining the economic balance and a visible since August 2000 decrease of inflation is a stable process that will ensure strengthening of macroeconomic bases for a long-term development. In this connection, the Council awaits the decisions on the final shape of the state budget for 2001 and the information on: 1. the distribution of the budget deficit and expenses in particular months of 2001 -especially in the first quarter this year, 2. the way of deficit financing, including information on the distribution of planned revenues from privatization, 3. the plans of the Government in the area of completing the domestic supply on the foodstuff market in order to counteract the rise of foodstuff prices. The Council again emphasizes the basic importance of fast balancing of the public finance and structural reforms that improve the quality and competitiveness of markets -including mainly the labour, foodstuff and fuel markets -for ensuring the effectiveness of the process of inflation decreasing and reducing its short-term costs. Moreover, structural reforms constitute an important factor of the long-term economic growth. The Monetary Policy Council decided to maintain its neutral position in monetary policy. The Monetary Policy Council informs that it will hold two-day meetings in future. The next meeting will be held on February 27-28, 2001. The release from the meeting will be issued after the second day of the meeting."
Israel,2004-01-26,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for February 2004. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for February 2004, according to which the interest rate will be reduced by 0.3 percentage points to 4.5 percent. This brings the cumulative reduction in the Bank of Israel's interest rate since December 2002 to 4.6 percentage points. The continuation of the process of reducing the interest rate is made possible by the fact that one-year inflation expectations are in the lower part of the price-stability target range of 1-3 percent, against the backgroundof the actual reduction in the Consumer Price Index in the last twelve months, the continued moderate level of real economic activity, and the relative calm in the foreign currency, money and capital markets. Concurrent with the process of reducing the interest rate and narrowing the interest-rate differential between Israel and other countries, the money supply rose by almost 9 percent in the last year and the NIS depreciated by about 8 percent against the currency basket since the end of June. The continued gradual reduction of the interest rate, in the light of its current level and its reduction by more than a half since the end of 2002, has lowered short-term real interest from 7.2 percent to 4.1 percent in that period, and therefore helps to encourage growth and boost employment while maintaining price and financial stability. One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market rose slightly in January, and are currently at the lower boundary of the target range, and expectations for the second year ahead are within the target range. Private forecasters' predictions of 12-month inflation rose slightly and are below the middle of the target range, and some of the models developed by the Bank of Israel indicate that it is possible to attain the inflation target for the coming year and the following year while slowly continuing to reduce the interest rate. Changes in the composition of the public's asset portfolio in 2003 derived inter alia from the process of interest-rate reduction by the Bank of Israel. Most prominent among the changes this year is the rise in the proportion of shares in the portfolio due to the increase in their price, which accounted for almost two-thirds of the increase in the portfolio. The decline in short- and long-term interest rates led to a rise in the value of the tradable assets portfolio, with a switch from bank deposits to investment in tradable assets which was also partly due to changes in taxation on financial assets. Furthermore, despite the marked reduction in the interest-rate differential between Israel and the rest of the world, with the continued proper functioning of the markets there has been a gradual adjustment of the shares of local-currency and foreign-currency assets; only in the last two months have there been indications of a certain rise in Israelis' investment abroad. Inthe last few months the decline in yields on government bonds has persisted, albeit at a slower rate: since the beginning of the year nominal yields (on 10-year bonds) have dropped by more than 4.5 percentage points to a level of about 6.9 percent, and real long-term yields by more than 2.0 percentage points to a level of about 4.0 percent. The reduction in long-term interest on government bonds apparently indicates that the public considers that the budget deficit in 2003 (which was relatively large and greater than in 2002) derives mainly from the temporary effect of the low level of economic activity in reducing the government's tax revenues, and that it is to a lesser degree a structural deficit constituting a long-term problem. Following the Knesset's approval of the government's budget for 2004, adhering to its framework is vital for the preservation of the stability that has been attained. The determination to return to a declining government deficit and debt path, together with the reform of the labor market and the implementation of the plans for infrastructure investment, will help to steer the economy back onto a path of growth. Departure from this path, in view of the large government debt, is likely to lead to a rise in nominal and real yields andto hamper the process of economic recovery that has recently begun to emerge. The calm in the foreign currency market evident in the last two months continued, with the strengthening of the NIS relative to the dollar and its marked depreciation against the euro reflecting changes in the international currency markets. Israel's risk premium, as measured by the 5-year credit-default-swap (CDS) market, remained at 60 basis points in January, after the downward path evident since the first quarter of 2003. The calm in the market appears to be due to the US government loan guarantees and the credibility of macroeconomic policy in the eyes of the public. Nonresidents' short-term capital inflow to Israel is affected among other things by changes in interest rates in other advanced and emerging economies (not only the USand Europe) to which international capital flows are directed. In this context Israel's interest rate may be compared to that in other countries (Table 3): the Bank of Israel's interest rate is slightly below the interest rates of central banks in some advanced economies (Australia, 5.25 percent and New Zealand, 5 percent), only 0.75 percentage points higher than in the UK, and in the mid-range of central-bank interest rates in emerging markets and other developing economies. Moreover, the differential between interest on tradable government bonds such as in the US and Israel has contracted more rapidly than that derived from central banks' interest rates. The Bank of Israel monitors developments in the markets and will continue to act to bring the inflation rate into the price stability range while bolstering financial stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will continue to act to support the policy of fostering employment and boosting economic activity. Table 1: Interest Rates in Israel and the US.

United States,2004-01-28,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent. The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that output is expanding briskly. Although new hiring remains subdued, other indicators suggest an improvement in the labor market. Increases in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low. The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Thomas M Hoenig; Donald L Kohn; Cathy E Minehan; Mark W Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole."
Philippines,2004-02-04,"The Monetary Board, in its meeting today, decided to increase the liquidity reserve requirement for universal banks and commercial banks by two percentage points. The liquidity reserve requirement against peso demand, savings, time deposit and deposit substitutes of universal banks (UBs) and commercial banks (KBs) as well as of the peso-denominated common trust funds (CTF) and other fiduciary activities (TOFA) will increase by 2 percent to 10 percent effective Friday, 6 February 2004. The decision to raise the liquidity reserve requirement is intended to address the potential inflationary impact of the recent volatility in the foreign exchange market. The increase in the liquidity reserve requirement will siphon off the excess peso liquidity from the financial system that may otherwise find its way into the foreign exchange market and thereby help mitigate the pressure on the domestic currency. This move will not significantly affect banks' intermediation costs and lending rates since liquidity reserves are paid market interest rates. The BSP closely monitors developments in the foreign exchange market. The Monetary Board is prepared to take additional policy action, if necessary, to ensure orderly financial market conditions in accordance with its primary mandate of promoting price stability."
Euroarea,2004-02-05,"The Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. On the basis of our economic and monetary analysis, we have concluded that there are no fundamental changes to the medium-term outlook for price stability. Accordingly, the current stance of monetary policy remains appropriate and the key ECB interest rates have been kept unchanged at their low levels. Inflationary risks should be contained by somewhat more favourable import price developments, while the economic recovery in the euro area should proceed in line with our expectations. We will continue to monitor carefully all developments that could affect our assessment of risks to price stability over the medium term. With regard to exchange rates, we again particularly stress stability and remain concerned about excessive exchange rate moves. Starting with the economic analysis, the latest data on euro area production as well as survey evidence on business confidence remain consistent with ongoing growth around the turn of the year. Looking ahead, the external environment of the euro area should continue to develop favourably. In particular, robust real GDP growth in our major trading partners' economies can be expected to support foreign demand for euro area goods and services, while export growth may be dampened somewhat by the decline in price competitiveness. The conditions for an improvement in domestic demand are also favourable. Investment activity should not only profit from global trends in demand, but also from companies' efforts to enhance productivity and profitability, from the low level of interest rates and from generally favourable financing conditions. Growth in private consumption, which has so far remained rather subdued, can also be expected to recover in line with an increase in real disposable income. This assessment is reflected in all available forecasts from official and private sources and seems to be confirmed by developments in financial markets. Looking at the risks to this outlook, there are no new factors to be taken into account. Over longer horizons, uncertainties relate to the persistent imbalances in some regions of the world and their potential repercussions on the sustainability of global economic growth. This calls for sustainable macroeconomic policies and structural reforms which foster a sound balance between savings and investment in all major partner countries, which enhance the production potential in the euro area and which support a further expansion in trade of goods and services at the global level. Turning to price developments, we have seen a fall in the HICP inflation rate for December to 2.0%. In the course of this year, inflation rates should fall below 2% and remain in line with price stability thereafter. While US dollar-denominated global commodity prices have been on an upward trend over recent months, the past appreciation of the euro is dampening their effects on domestic prices. Moreover, we continue to expect wage developments to remain moderate in the context of high rates of unemployment and a gradual economic recovery. Recent data on labour costs seem to broadly confirm the assessment of a levelling-off of wage increases. On the whole, inflationary pressure remains limited  an assessment that is confirmed by all available forecasts. Given the conditional nature of any forward-looking evaluation, it is of course important to bear in mind all elements of risk to the outlook for price stability and to monitor inflation expectations closely. Turning to the monetary analysis, annual M3 growth has continued to moderate slowly over recent months. This can be explained by the still cautious reallocation of portfolios by economic agents and the effects of generally low interest rates on the growth of very liquid assets. At the same time, the growth of loans to the private sector reflects the effects of both low interest rates and an improvement in the economic environment. The strong monetary growth over the past few years means that there is significantly more liquidity available in the euro area than needed to finance non-inflationary growth. Whether or not the accumulated excess liquidity will translate into inflationary pressures over the medium term depends on the extent to which past portfolios shifts are reversed and on the future strength of economic growth. Should excess liquidity persist, it could lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term. In summary, the economic analysis continues to indicate that the main scenario for price developments in the medium term is in line with price stability. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis does not alter this picture. With regard to fiscal policies, there are several important issues that warrant close attention. First, the implementation of fiscal policies should be in line with the commitments made late last year. In this connection, a thorough assessment of the new Stability Programmes of Member States is currently under way. All parties involved need to live up to their responsibilities and commitments. Sound public finances support a stable macroeconomic framework, which in turn enhances confidence and promotes investment, growth and employment in the euro area. Second, as regards the Stability and Growth Pact, the Governing Council shares the concerns of the European Commission regarding the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council in November last year. The Commission is the guardian of the Treaty and the ECB respects the Commission's decision to seek legal clarity. Furthermore, we do not see a need to change the Treaty and, in our view, the Stability and Growth Pact in its current form is appropriate. We are in agreement with the Commission that the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact could be further improved, in particular in terms of the analysis of structural imbalances and the strengthening of incentives for sound fiscal policies during good economic times. Clarity and enforceability of the fiscal framework should be enhanced. A stable macroeconomic framework is necessary to enhance our growth potential, but it alone is not sufficient. Boosting employment, fostering labour productivity and making the best use of technological and scientific progress in the context of an ageing society all require structural reforms  in the fiscal domain as well as in financial, product and labour markets. The Lisbon Strategy provides the appropriate blueprint for progress. The responsibility for its implementation, however, lies with governments, parliaments and social partners. The Governing Council strongly supports ongoing efforts in a number of countries to proceed with structural reforms. At the same time, we fully share the view that additional, sustained efforts are required, as recently reiterated by the Commission in its progress report on the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the priorities for 2004. It is a major challenge to convince the public at large that everybody would benefit  in terms of growth, more and better jobs, and higher incomes  if the reforms needed were indeed implemented. Finally, allow me to add a short remark regarding the publications of the ECB. As you may have noticed, the ECB's Monthly Bulletin has been enhanced in a number of ways relating to its design, structure and general presentation. The in-depth coverage of all economic and monetary aspects relevant to monetary policy has of course been maintained, together with the statistical information. However, we believe that the report is now more accessible to the Press, financial market participants, policy-makers, and academics and students, as well as those members of the general public with an interest in European economic and monetary affairs."
Peru,2004-02-05,"Press Release BOARD OF THE CENTRAL BANK APPROVED MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2004 REFERENCE INTEREST RATE IS KEPT AT 2.50% In January 2004, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.54 percent. Cumulative inflation through last 12 month reached 2.8 percent, more than in December 2003 (2.5 percent). However, core inflation, a price indicator that excludes high volatility items grew 1.4 percent over last 12 months. The faster path for annual inflation in the last three months is mainly determined by the imported component of food supply, such as the international price hikes in wheat and soy oil (with the consequent impact on the prices of bread and edible oil), as well as a troubled domestic supply of potato, peas, rice and sugar. The projections included in the January Inflation Report point out that inflation will meet the target of 2.5 percent for 2004. The Board of the Central Bank decided to maintain the reference interest rates for monetary operations off auction: 3.25 percent: for direct repos and monetary regulation credits 1.75 percent: for overnight deposits. The monetary operations regarding injection or withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions are made in order to place the interbank interest rate in the center of this corridor of reference interest rates (2.50 percent). The interbank interest rate was 2.41 percent in January, lower than in December (2.51 percent). In case the market interbank interest rate be higher than 3.25 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. For February, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCRP is 170 - 190 million. This balance is neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it is also affected by seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes. The interest rates for Central Bank's operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP's deposits held abroad Swaps, the commission that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.25 percent is maintained March Monetary Program will be approved in the Board of Directors meeting of March 4, 2004."
South Korea,2004-02-06,"Private consumption and facilities investment still show downward movements, whereas the growth of industrial production has accelerated greatly owing to strong exports. Overall, the real economy continues to show signs of a gradual improvement. Consumer price inflation showed a relatively rapid rise in January for the second month in a row due to seasonal factors associated with the Lunar New Year and the upswing in international oil prices. Fundamentally, however, inflation has remained stable, as demand-pull pressures are still weak. It is estimated that the current account surplus widened in January owing to the enlargement of the surplus on the goods account compared to that of the previous month. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions have been relatively favorable due to subdued demand for funds. Concern over the fragile management status of certain financial institutions including a few credit card companies has, however, persisted and there has been no let-up in risk aversion from low-rated corporations. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.75 percent) for the intermeeting period."
Chile,2004-02-10,"The Central Bank of Chile * Press Release Santiago, 10 February 2004 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 1.75% (annual). Economic developments since the last meeting reinforce the output and price forecasts in the last Monetary Policy Report. This scenario considers negative readings for annual inflation (12-month rate-of- change) for some months, and a subsequent increase to approach 3% toward the end of the 24-month horizon. This is based on the expected reduction in the output gap and the fading of supply-side shocks. The recent increase in expected inflation for the medium and long term, implicit in the prices of financial assets is consistent with this view. The Central Bank of Chile reiterates that it will continue to conduct monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to address any projected inflation deviations in either direction from the specified target inflation rate. In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
Philippines,2004-02-11,"The Monetary Board decided today to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The decision to maintain the prevailing monetary policy settings reflects the Monetary Board's belief that the current monetary policy stance is appropriately supportive of the price stability objective and is consistent with the need to ensure sufficient liquidity to sustain domestic demand. This view stems from the Monetary Board's latest assessment of prevailing macroeconomic and financial conditions, which suggests a manageable expected path for inflation over the policy horizon and downside risks for overall economic activity due to the continued modest pace of money and credit demand. Meanwhile, recent pressures in the foreign exchange market have raised concerns about a possible threat to the inflation objective arising from a sustained episode of currency depreciation. As a preemptive response to this threat, the Monetary Board raised the liquidity reserve requirement on peso deposits and deposit substitutes of banks and non-banks with quasi-banking functions (NBQBs) by 2 percentage points on 6 February 2004. In the future, monetary authorities may consider further active policy measures to avoid the adverse inflationary implications of a sharp and sustained depreciation of the peso consistent with their core responsibility of maintaining price stability in the context of inflation targeting. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to review the BSP's monetary policy stance on 11 March 2004."
Nigeria,2004-02-18,"PRESS RELEASE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 32 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE FOR JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 2004 The Central Bank of Nigeria hereby publishes a summary of the deliberations and decisions of its Monetary Policy Committee in January and February, 2004. This is in keeping with the Bank's policy of transparency in its conduct of monetary and financial policies. The Committee met twice during the period, once each month. review of major macroeconomic indicators and financial market developments revealed that, while signs of a modest economic recovery were becoming noticeable and the financial markets remained generally stable, the problem of inflation resurgence was evident. The pressure on the foreign exchange market, however, moderated somewhat, with the exchange rate of the naira recording a marginal appreciation in January. Also the level of gross external reserves increased marginally. In contrast to the excessive monetary expansion that characterized most of 2003, a sharp contraction in money supply was observed in December, 2003 and January 2004. Specifically the broad money stock (M ) declined by 53 and 02 per cent in both months, respectively as narrow 2 money (M ) fell substantially by 78 and 32 per cent, respectively, during 1 the two months. Conversely in January, 2003 M2 and M1 increased substantially by 92 and 112 per cent, respectively. The main contractionary factors of money supply during the review period, were the sharp fall in banking system credit (net) to the Federal Government and public sector institutions and the decline in foreign assets (net) of the banking system. Attributable largely to the lagged effect of the excessive growth of money supply in 2003 and 2002, the pass through effect of the naira depreciation and the hike in the price of fuel, the inflation resurgence observed in September 2003 continued into December. Actual data from the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) indicated a further rise in the inflation rate to 140 per cent (on the twelve-month moving average basis) in December, 2003, up from 130 and 123 per cent in November and October, 2003, respectively. On a month-on-month basis, the annualized rate of inflation was 238 per cent in December 2003, compared with 213 per cent in the preceding month. The rise in the composite index was influenced, largely, by the increases in prices of food items and transportation costs. The increased demand pressure experienced in the foreign exchange market in October, 2003 continued into December. However the pressure moderated in January 2003 and contributed to the marginal appreciation of the naira exchange rate, from N13753 in December, 2003 to N13612 per 2 US$100 in January 2004 at the Dutch Auction System (DAS) segment of the market. Correspondingly the naira appreciated in the Bureaux De Change (BDC) from N15034 to N14744 per US$100 over the same period. The surfeit of funds in the money market influenced the continued downward movement of interest rates. Available information showed that both the deposit and lending rates of the banks declined in January, from their respective levels in December, 2003. Moreover the call money rate in the inter-bank market, recorded a substantial fall, from 2111 to 1226 per cent per annum over the review period. In its overall assessment of developments in the economy, the Committee was encouraged by the improvement, although modest, in the growth performance of the real sector, helped by the strong agricultural sector performance and enhanced capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector. Also the moderation of demand pressure in the foreign exchange market seemed to have been sustained, resulting in the continued appreciation of the naira in all segments of the foreign exchange market. The resurgence of inflation in September, 2003 and its escalation in the subsequent months was, however, of great concern to the Committee. Recognising the urgent need to douse inflationary expectations and bring the rate down, the Committee at its February 2004 meeting decided to 3 tighten the stance of monetary policy. Consequently it approved a selective withdrawal of public sector funds from the banking system, targeting a total of N40 billion, as a strategy for reducing excess liquidity in the system. The Committee emphasized the need for continued monitoring of macroeconomic and financial market developments, with a view to taking appropriate policy measures.

Israel,2004-02-23,"The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for March 2004, according to which the interest rate will be reduced by 0.2 percentage points to 4.3 percent. This brings the cumulative reduction in the Bank of Israel's interest rate since December 2002 to 4.8 percentage points. This reduction in the interest rate is made possible: despitea certain rise in inflation expectations and in long-term interest rates: by the continued calm in the foreign currency, money and capital markets, the actual reduction in the Consumer Price Index in the last year, and the continued moderate level of activity in the economy which is slowly emerging from recession. Together with the process ofreducing the interest rate and narrowing the interest-rate differential between Israel and other countries, the money supply rose by about 10 percent in the last year and the NIS depreciated by about 8 percent against the currency basket since the end of June 2003. The cuts in theBank of Israel interest rate since the end of 2002 have lowered short-term real interest from 7.2 percent to 3.1 percent in that period, and therefore help to encourage growth and boost employment while maintaining price stability and financial stability. One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market rose in January and February, and are currently above the lower boundary of thetarget range. Expectations for the second year ahead also rose, and are currently in the upper part of the target range. Private forecasters' predictions of 12-month inflation also rose slightly and are below the middle of the target range, and some of the models developed by the Bank of Israel still indicate that it is possible to attain the inflation target for the coming year and the following year while continuing to reduce the interest rate slowly. Changes in the composition of the public's asset portfolio in 2003 derived inter alia from the process of interest-rate reduction by the Bank of Israel. Most prominent among the changes is the rise in the proportion of shares in the portfolio due to the increase in their price, which accounted for almost two-thirds of the increase in the portfolio. The decline in short- and long-term interest rates led to a rise in the value of the tradable assets portfolio, with a switch from bank deposits to investment in tradable assets which was also partlydue to changes in taxes on financial assets. Furthermore, despite the reduction in the interest-rate differential between Israel and the rest of the world, there has been a gradual adjustment of the shares of local-currency and foreign-currency assets, as the markets continued functioning properly; only in the last two months have there been indications of a certain rise in Israelis' investment abroad. In the last month the decline in yields on government bonds halted, and a small rise was evident, particularly in the yield on the longest unindexed bond, which rose to 7.3 percent from 7.0 percent at the end of 2003. This follows a marked fall in yields during 2003, against the background of the reassertion of fiscal control, the receipt of the loan guarantees from the US government and the reduction ofIsrael's country risk. Perseverance in reverting to a downward path for the budget deficit and government debt is essential for the maintenance of stability and the continued reduction in interest rates for all periods. In this context it should be noted that the downward trend in Treasury bill yields also stopped, and for the first time since mid-2002 the yield on 12-month Treasury bills is higher than the Bank of Israel rate of interest. Deviation from a downward sloping deficit path, against the background of the high government debt of 105 percent of GDP, is likely to cause a rise in nominal and real yields and to create obstacles along the route of economic recovery, the first signs of which have appeared recently. The calm in the foreign currency market evident in the last two months continued, with the weakening of the NIS relative to the dollarand its faster depreciation against the euro reflecting changes in the international currency markets. Israel's risk premium, as measured by the 5-year credit-default-swap (CDS) market, remained at 60 basis points in February, after the downward path evident since the first quarter of 2003. Nonresidents' short-term capital inflow to Israel is affected among other things by changes in interest rates in other advanced and emerging economies (not only the US and Europe) to which international capital flows are directed. In this context Israel's interest rate may be compared to that in othercountries (Table 3): the Bank of Israel's interest rate is lower than the interest rates of central banks in some advanced economies (Australia, 5.25 percent and New Zealand, 5 percent), only 0.3 percentage points higher than in the UK, and in the mid-range of central-bank interest rates in emerging markets and other developing economies. The Bank of Israel monitors developments in the markets and will continue to act, as it has acted hitherto, to bring the inflation rate into the price stability range while bolstering financial stability.This policy, which has reduced the short-term real rate of interest,helps to foster employment and boost economic activity, which is the main objective of the economic policy.

Malaysia,2004-02-25,"The Malaysian economy entered 2004 on a more positive note with growth expected to strengthen further during the year. Economic and financial indicators have confirmed earlier expectations that the global economic recovery is gaining momentum. Strengthening external demand has translated into a more rapid growth in Malaysian exports. The strong recovery in export growth, sustained growth in consumer spending and private investment activity raised the real GDP growth to 6.4% in the fourth quarter, the highest quarterly growth since the fourth quarter of 2000. The stronger economic performance is taking place in an environment of low inflation. Sectors experiencing strong growth are expanding capacity, while increasing competition in both the product and labour markets and low inflation abroad will reduce price pressures. In this period, accommodative monetary policy would therefore continue to support growth. The low interest rate environment will remain to reinforce the private sector-led expansion. Bank Negara Malaysia 25 February 2004."
Poland,2004-02-25,"Warsaw, 25 February 2004 INFORMATION FROM A MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 24-25 February 2004 On 24-25 February 2004 the Monetary Policy Council held a meeting. The Council read materials prepared by the Management Board and the NBP Departments, and information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council discussed the external environment of the Polish economy as well as real trends, trends in payments and social welfare benefits, trends in the public finance sector, trends in the money supply, loans and interest rates and the formation of pricing and inflationary and prices expectations as well as inflationary prospects. In January 2004 the annual CPI indictor was 1.7% as in December 2003. The economic data for the period since the last Monetary Policy Council meeting of January 2004 indicate: I Continuing presence of some factors supporting the continuation of a low inflation level: continued moderate money supply level; annual rate of growth of the M3 aggregate increased by 5.1% in January 2004 against 5.6% in December 2003, continued low growth rate of loans in the economy. Annual rate of growth rate in corporate loans in January 2004 was at 2.6% against 2.1% in December of last year, with 13.8% and 13.6% for household loans respectively, after acceleration of salary growth trends in December, the January statistics do not confirm a weakening of corporate salaries discipline. The annual growth trend in the average monthly gross corporate salary in the corporate sector has decreased from 5.1% in December of last year to 3.5% in January of this year. II. Growth trends in the economy are clearly consolidating. The Polish economy is currently in a revival phase. If the consumption trend is maintained at a level close to that of 2003, one can expect a continuance of growth trends in the economy for the next few years. This will gradually increase inflationary pressure. according GUS data the GDP rate of growth in the 4th quarter of 2003 was at 4.7%, while for the entire 2003 it was 3.7%, in January 2004, as compared to January 2003, industrial production was as a whole greater by 14.3%, with 17.9% for the processing industry. After seasonal trends, the growth in production as a whole was 16.6%, with 20.7% in the processing industry. The growth trend in production became stronger both in the processing industry (with the annual growth rate of the trend at 16.8%) and in industry as a whole (13.0%), growth trend of investment in the economy has not been reported, however, one observes a clear growth trend of investment in the processing industry; in the course of three quarterly periods in 2003, investment expenditures in the processing industry increased in current prices by 19.6%, results of February survey on the general condition of enterprises indicates continuing improvement in the general market trends of the processing industry, retail sales growth of 7.6% was reported in January 2004, growth of exports; in accordance with payments statistics in 2003, there was a 8.7% growth of exports denominated in euro and 30.3% growth of exports denominated in USD, while in 2002 this growth was respectively 2.7% and 8.8%, there are continuing signs of an economic revival in the USA and Japan that may contribute to a moderate revival in the euro area and at the same time influence a growth in external demand. III. There has been no change to the importance of factors hampering the stabilisation of inflation at a low level. The Council re-emphasises that the most important of these is the condition of public finance. A high budget deficit, rapid growth in public debt, increasing loan requirements and uncertainty as to the present situation and prospects for pubic finance are the cause of the weakening the exchange rate of the zloty and the increasing profitability of treasury securities. As of the last meeting of the Council on 21- 23 January of this year, the zloty weakened against the euro by 3.2% and 3.8% against the USD. The Council re-emphasises, that fundamental, swift and effective reforms leading to recovery of public finance are indispensable for avoiding debt build-up that threatens exceeding prudential thresholds specified in the Public Finance Act and which would prevent rapid economic growth and unemployment reduction. According to current NBP estimates, there is likelihood of exceeding the second prudential threshold i.e. 55% of the GDP in 2004. Against this background, the Council notes with disquiet those decisions of the Sejm that worsen the condition of the state budget for 2004 and in following years. It is also disquieting that there is a possibility of delays in privatisation that will cause an even faster growth in public debt. IV. Other possible factors of inflationary pressure: High growth rate of cash in circulation. In January 2004 the annual rate of growth of this aggregate was 16.5% (17.1% in December of last year). Further growth in oil prices. Actual forecast of the average annual price of oil in 2004 has been increased by 1.1 USD/b in comparison with the January 2004 forecast. Systematic growth in the PPI indicator which in January reached a level of 4.2%. Growth in price of foodstuffs in 2004 which may be greater than is indicated in actually available forecasts. Growth in inflationary expectations reported in the course of the past three months and worsening of response structure to survey questions. ٭٭٭ The Council re-affirmed the basic conditions contained in the Monetary Policy Strategy beyond 2003: Μοnetary policy will be conducted within the framework of direct inflation targeting strategy (DIT). Floating exchange rate system should be maintained until the moment of entering ERM2, Τhe Council re-affirms that the aim of monetary policy is targeted to attain a stable inflation rate of 2.5% with a permissible volatility band of +/-1 percentage point, Τhe Monetary Policy Council is convinced that Poland would profit the most from the adoption of an economic strategy that fosters optimum conditions for the introduction of the euro at the earliest date possible. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council: The Council resolved: to leave the monetary policy parameters unchanged and maintain its neutral approach to monetary policy, though it does not exclude adopting a restrictive approach at the next meeting. The next meeting of the Council will take place 30  31 March 2004 External factors In January 2004 there was a consolidation of revival signals in the global Stronger revival signals economy. There was a rapid increase in the USA of the so-called leading indicators. in the global economy There has been an improvement in economic confidence amongst businesses and households which is confirmed by an increase of the rate of orders received by the processing industry and the high turnover in retail trade. Indicators of current activity in the euro area continue to indicate a weakness in consumer demand, a lack of improvement in the main indexes of household confidence while in the German economy there is a deepening drop in retail sales. The euro area's revival has been accompanied by confidence of European business which was most clearly signalled by the indicators of investment climate in Germany, namely the indicators of the IFO institute. January 2004 saw the deepening of the dollar's depreciation on global markets which has been observed for nearly two years and which has been most apparent against the euro (in January the average monthly exchange rate of the EUR/USD was at the level of 1.26 against 1.23 in December 2003). In January 2004 the price of oil continued to rise on global markets. The High oil prices on average price of Brent oil was equal to 31.2 USD/b, i.e. 1.3 USD more than in global markets December of last year. Reserves of oil in the USA, which were kept at a historical minimum, together with the clearly lower than normal registered temperatures in January of this year in South-Eastern USA, contributed to maintaining growth tendencies. The price increases in January of this year led the Department of State for Energy to increase in February of this year its forecast of oil prices for 2004 to 29.4 USD/b (an increase of 1.1 USD/b in comparison with the forecast of January 2004). Economic situation in Poland In December 2003 the current account deficit amounted to EUR 680 million, which was EUR 190 million higher than in December 2002. Deepening of the Improvement of negative current account balance was on the one hand a result of an increase of the Current account deficit for earnings and services items, while on the other hand significantly lower balance in 2003 than the previous months improvement in the balance of commodity payments. The value of export receipts increased by 25.2% while the value of import debits increased by 18.4% (this was the highest increase in import debits since January 2001). In the period January to December 2003 the negative balance of the current account decreased by EUR 3.5 billion (compared to EUR 7.2 billion in 2002). The improvement in the current account balance, as similarly in previous years, stemmed mainly from a decrease of EUR 2.4 billion in the commodity payments deficit and an increase in the excess of unclassified turnover by EUR 1.9 billion. The remaining items on the current account were influencing, however, in the direction of worsening the balance: the negative balance of earnings and services deepened and the positive balance of transfers was subject to a decrease. According to GUS data the growth trend of the GDP in the 4th quarter of 2003 GDP increase by 4.7% amounted to approximately 4.7%. Such a significant acceleration was a result of a in 4th quarter of 2003; strong growth trend of added value in industry whose growth rate in the 4th quarter 3.7% for entire 2003 amounted to 9.7%. The divisional industrial structure indicates that the main factor for growth continued to be in production destined for export. During the entire 2003 the highest growth rate was for firms manufacturing investment goods in the amount of about 21% which were destined for foreign recipients to an even greater extent. The increasing level of economic activity gave rise also to an accelerated sale of supply goods (from 9% after three quarterly periods to 11% for the entire 2003). There was a relatively weaker growth of around 6% in consumer goods manufacturing. The main factor in accelerating rate of growth of the GDP in the 4th quarter of 2003 was the distribution of consumption and the positive input of net exports. The growth trend in individual consumption increased to 3.9%. One can assume that this lt f i i di bl i was a result of an increase in disposable income. Contrary to expectations, there was no acceleration of investment demand in the 4th quarter. The gross expenditures on fixed assets were higher than the year before by barely 0.1%. However, in the processing industry, in the course of three quarterly periods of 2003, investment expenditures rose in current prices by 19.6%. There has been continued very high export growth due chiefly to growing foreign sales of processing industry products. In face of a lack of a definite revival in investment demand, there was a weaker growth in imports. As a result, the net export input to the GDP growth in the 4th quarter was at a level close to that reported in the second quarter (approximately 1.9%). Increase in industrial The increase in industrial production in January 2004 was higher than market production higher than expectations. Despite a shorter work period by one working day in comparison with expected in January January of last year, industrial production rose on the whole by about 14.3%. The this year second month reported a very high growth trend in the processing industry where the sales volume increased by 17.9% (in December by 18.7%). After eliminating the influence of seasonal factors the increase in production on the whole was 16.6% while in the processing industry 20.7%. As previously, the highest growth rate was reported in divisions with large and growing export sales. After moderately good results in December of last year, which was as result, amongst others, of favourable weather conditions. January saw a return to a downward trend in construction. In comparison with January of last year construction-assembly production was lower by 9.5%. The decline was reported in all construction divisions. Positive assessment of The February GUS study indicates the maintenance of a positive assessment of the condition of the the general condition of the processing industry. On the whole an improvement in processing industry demand in this section resulted chiefly from a positive assessment of foreign demand. Industrial entrepreneurs forecast that in the course of immediate months the favourable condition will be maintained as far as export possibilities as well as in an increase of domestic demand and in sold production. Investment goods producers gave the best assessment regarding demand as a whole, which together with their signalling a lack of a ready supply of products, seems to indicate the possibility of investment revival of the economy. Condition of public finance sector In January the state budget revenue were nominally higher than those in the same period last year (an increase of 2.9%), as a result of higher by 37.7% non-tax receipts chiefly from revenues of state budget units. Tax revenues showed an increase of only 0.4% which was a consequence of the obligatory higher participation of territorial self-governing units in personal and corporate taxation, which is obligatory as of 1 January 2004. The level of realisation as a whole for the revenue plan was 7.8% in January of this year and was higher than that reported in January 2003. The budget expenditures realised in January were higher by 3.3% than in the analogous month of last year. The moderate expenditures growth was a result, amongst others, of a low level of the cost of servicing the public debt and not transferring the subvention to the Labour Fund. On the other hand, the state budget transferred to FUS and FER more means than during the same period last year. The state budget expenditures after January of this year reached 8.1% of the size set forth in the Budget Act, which is the same as that in the analogous period of 2003. The budget deficit was approximately PLN 4.2 billion which means that about 9.3% annual limit had been utilised, compared to 10.4% last year. In January of this year, the chief source of financing loan requirements of the state budget was from means amassed at the end of 2003 and from input of eurobond issues. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate According to figures presented in forward information, in January 2004 the M3 money supply decreased by PLN 6.2 billion (-1.8%) in comparison with December 2003, reaching at the end of the month a level of PLN 333.9 billion. Changes in the money supply were materially affected by the weakening of the zloty exchange. After removal of the influence of exchange rates the M3 decrease amounted to about PLN 7.2 billion (-2.1%). The annual growth rate of M3 aggregate amounted to 5.1%. The state of cash in circulation decreased by PLN 0.9 billion (-1.8%), reaching at the end of January 2004 a level of PLN 48.5 billion. The annual rate of growth of cash in circulation decreased from 17.1% in December 2003 to 16.5% in January 2004 and its value should still be recognised as high. A deep decrease in deposits in the banking system was reported in January 2003 that stemmed to a large extent from a decrease in corporate deposits. On the whole deposits forming part of the M3 decreased by PLN 5.4 billion (-1.9%) and after eliminating the influence of exchange rate fluctuations this decrease amounted to approximately PLN 6.4 billion (-2.2%). The state of corporate deposits decreased by PLN 4.8 billion (-7.0%), with a decrease of PLN 5.0 billion (-7.3%) after clearing it of exchange rate influence. The annual rate of growth in corporate deposits continues to be at a relatively high level. The household deposits decreased in January by PLN 0.8 billion (-0.4%); after removing the influence of exchange rate fluctuations this drop was deeper at approximately PLN 1.5 billion (-0.8%). The continuous negative annual rate of growth of household deposits was subject to an increase in January to 1.7%. The significant January decrease in bank deposits was not reflected in an assets growth of investment funds, which amounted to only about PLN 0.3 billion. Low corporate loan Loans on the whole increased in January 2004 by about PLN 1.6 billion (0.6%) growth; but their nominal growth was significantly overstated owing to exchange rate moderate for changes. After their elimination, the January growth amounted to about PLN 0.6 households billion (0.2%). The growth in loans on the whole was foremost a result of an growth in the value of corporate loans, which increased by PLN 2.6 billion (1.9%); this increase, after eliminating the influence of exchange rates, was about PLN 2.0 billion (1.5%). The annual rate of growth for corporate loans increased from 2.1% in December of last year to 2.6% in January 2004. The value of household loans increased in January 2004 by PLN 0.5 billion (0.5%), while it was lower and was about PLN 0.2 billion (0.2%) after clearing it of the influence of exchange rate fluctuations. In the two previous years, in comparable conditions, there was a small drop in January of household indebtedness. The annual loan growth rate for households decreased insignificantly from 14% in December of last year to 13.8% in January 2004. Zloty depreciation and In the period of 21 January to 23 February 2004 there was further, systematic high treasury bond zloty depreciation. The zloty weakened both against the euro and against the dollar price fluctuation by 3.2% and 3.8% respectively. From the beginning of the year the exchange rate of EUR/PLN and USD/PLN increased by 4.0% and 4.2% respectively. An increase in fiscal risk (possibility of not receiving Sejm acceptance for the government's programme for creating a clear structure of public expenditures and their reduction) and an increase of political risk (possibility of government resigning and necessity for early elections) were factors that caused the depreciation. Existing zloty depreciation still cannot be attributed to macro-economic factors. During the analogous period there was a high fluctuation in bond prices. The yield on 2-year, 5-year and 10-year bonds increased by 14, 7 and 3 b.p. respectively (from the beginning of the year this change was 4, 5 and 27 b.p. respectively). This is still at a level lower than that reported in November 2003. The fundamental factor influencing bond price fluctuation, similarly as in the case of the exchange rate, is an increase in fiscal and political risk. This led to the sale of bonds on the entire length of the yield curve from 13 January to 16 February. The nervous reaction of investors on the bond market was also increased by the weakened zloty in respect of the currency basket. As of 16 February, publication of the inflation indicator for January of this year (staking on a cut in rates) and renewed confidence in treasury bonds on global markets, was the factor that influenced the formation of a short-term downward yield trend. Despite high price fluctuation of treasury bonds and a further decline in the zloty's exchange and after the January sale, foreign investors in February re-built their treasury bonds portfolio, chiefly in the period from 16  23 February. Prices, inflationary expectations In January 2004 the annual CPI was 1.7%, as in December of 2003. In comparison with January 2003, the highest increase in prices was in transport (3.6%), apartment rents (2.6%), which resulted foremost from the prices of power carriers (3.0%), and price of foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages (2.2%). Prices of clothing and footwear, however, were lower than in January 2003 In January 2004 the annual PPI amounted to 4.2% (3.7% in December 2003), which means that it achieved the highest level since January 2001. This is a result of the growth in the prices of industrial raw materials (industrial metals, oil, coal) on global markets in the course of last year and in January of this year and also because of the growth in export prices that is connected with the weakening of the zloty against the euro. The inflation rate expected within the next 12 months by individuals is 2.2% (in January of this year it was 2.1%), while bank analysts forecast that in December 2004 the inflation rate will be 2.7% (in January of this year 2.6% was expected), while 2.6% in January 2005 (with no changes)."
South Africa,2004-02-26,"Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the rate of CPIX inflation has remained below the mid-point of the inflation target range. The success achieved in bringing inflation down to levels last experienced in the 1960s has been a major accomplishment of the macroeconomic policies pursued by the authorities, prudent monetary policy, disciplined fiscal policy, the significant recovery in the external value of the rand and the moderation in food price increases. All indications are that, on the basis of this improved inflation performance, the pick-up in growth that is already evident is likely to improve during 2004 and 2005. The twelve-month rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost of mortgage bonds (the CPIX) decreased from 11,3 per cent in October and November 2002 to 6,3 per cent in August 2003, and moved below the 6 per cent upper limit of the inflation target range to a value of 5,4 per cent in September. CPIX inflation then slowed down further to a year-on-year rate of 4,0 per cent in December 2003, before increasing marginally to 4,2 per cent in January 2004. For the year 2003 as a whole CPIX inflation averaged 6,8 per cent, compared with 9,3 per cent in 2002. Measured from quarter to quarter, the slowdown in CPIX inflation was even more impressive. This rate of increase in the CPIX decreased from a seasonally adjusted and annualised level of 12,4 per cent in the second quarter of 2002 to 1,2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2003. A number of factors contributed to the deceleration in the inflation rate in South Africa. Particularly important in this context was the 4 percentage points increase in the repo rate during 2002. This restrictive monetary policy stance and the discipline applied in government finances led to a decline in inflation expectations. The recovery in the exchange rate of the rand from the beginning of 2002 assisted in this process and eventually led to a decline in the prices of imported goods. In addition to these more fundamental factors, slower rates of increase in food and energy prices also contributed to the lowering of inflation. In fact, if energy and food prices are excluded from the CPIX, the twelve-month rate of increase in the prices of other goods and services declined from a peak of 8,0 per cent in November 2002 to 5,6 per cent in January 2004. Prices for services excluding the cost of mortgage bonds remained sticky. After fluctuating around a level of 8 per cent in the first nine months of 2003, the twelve-month rate of increase in these prices moderated somewhat from a peak of 8,6 per cent in September 2003 to 7,8 per cent in January 2004. By contrast, the rate of increase over twelve months in the prices of consumer goods fell from 13,4 per cent in October 2002 to 2,2 per cent in January 2004. A slowdown in the rate of increase in the prices of domestically produced goods and the decline in the prices of imported goods caused the year-on-year rate of increase in the all-goods production price index to decrease from 15,4 per cent in September 2002 to 0,2 per cent in August 2003. Subsequently, the production price index declined throughout the last five months of the year. For the year 2003 as a whole, overall production prices rose by (+)1,7 per cent compared to 14,2 per cent in 2002. The year-on-year rate of decrease in the all-goods production price index moderated from. Not only did the inflation outcome improve since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, but the inflation outlook generally also remained favourable. Most analysts and economic commentators expect CPIX inflation to remain within the inflation target range over the next two years. Inflation is projected to accelerate moderately during the course of 2004 to levels close to the upper limit of the inflation target, followed by somewhat slower rates of increase during 2005. These expected developments are consistent with projections made by the Reserve Bank's core econometric and other models. A number of factors will probably help to keep inflation within the target range during the next two years. Firstly, the generally low inflation in the rest of the world will continue to assist South Africa in containing domestic inflation. Strong global economic growth driven by the United States and Asia is expected to occur in an environment of relatively stable prices which bodes well for domestic price increases. Secondly, the slowdown in aggregate domestic production in 2003 has led to a decline in the utilisation of production capacity of manufacturing enterprises from a seasonally adjusted rate of 81,2 per cent in the third quarter of 2002 to 79,6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2003. Although the world economic recovery has set in motion an upswing in international commodity prices, some of these benefits to economic growth in South Africa have been neutralised by the exchange rate developments. Moreover, real gross domestic fixed investment again increased significantly in 2003. As a consequence, the acceleration in domestic economic growth is unlikely to lead to capacity constraints in the near future. Thirdly, the fiscal discipline applied by government has materially contributed to the lowering of inflation and the Budget for fiscal year 2004/05 is supportive of the inflation target. Fourthly, oil prices are not expected to be a threat to domestic price increases in the next two years despite the recent increases in the retail prices of petrol and diesel. The world oil demand and supply seem to be more or less in balance and OPEC continues to manage production limits to avoid large disruptive price movements. Most analysts still expect oil prices to decline somewhat in the coming months. Lastly, but by no means least, the recommended tariff increases of some public utility companies also auger well for the inflation outlook. Although the inflation outlook is generally positive, certain recent developments signal a moderate increase in CPIX inflation during 2004, which will have to be carefully monitored by the Monetary Policy Committee. Of particular concern is the consistent tendency of the wage settlement process to ignore the forward-looking inflation target. The carry-over effect of these tendencies will continue to put pressure on price increases in 2004. An anticipated moderation in wage settlement rates during the course of the year in line with the inflation target and a rise in productivity could, however, lead to lower rates of increase in nominal unit labour costs. Another development which could cause higher increases in consumer prices is the severe drought in some parts of South Africa. Low rainfall in important agricultural regions is expected to reduce the maize and other grain crops in 2004. This could be neutralised to a large extent by the run down of inventories or the increase in imports, but the future price of maize has already increased substantially from the beginning of December 2003. An anticipated rise in international food prices could also lead to an acceleration in the prices of domestic food products. Even if these effects on food prices are small, it seems unlikely that the positive impact that food prices had on the lowering of the inflation rate during 2003 will again occur in 2004. Perhaps even more important for the future inflation outlook is the continued acceleration in the growth of domestic final demand for goods and services. National accounts statistics are not yet available for the fourth quarter of 2003. However, many indicators, such as retail trade at constant prices, the purchases of new and used vehicles and electricity consumed, signal that domestic demand continued to increase at a high rate during the last half of 2003. Moreover, the full effect of the substantial reduction in interest rates from June 2003 will only become apparent during the course of 2004. As the growth in domestic demand exceeded the rate of increase in production, the surplus on the current account of the balance of payments in 2002 changed to a deficit in the first quarter of 2003. Trade statistics for the fourth quarter of the year indicate that this deficit could have widened further to a preliminary estimated 2 per cent of gross domestic product. Although this is a sizeable deficit, it was easily financed by the surplus on the financial account. This financial inflow also paved the way for a build up of net foreign reserves. A further deficit on the current account of the balance of payments is projected for 2004, but this deficit is not expected to exceed 2 per cent of gross domestic product. However, it seems unlikely that the positive effect that the significant recovery in the exchange rate of the rand had on inflation during 2003 will be as pronounced this year. The high domestic demand has been financed to some extent by means of bank credit extension and the issuing of bonds by government and the private sector. The total net issues of fixed-interest securities listed on the Bond Exchange of South Africa of both the public and private sector amounted to R59,1 billion in 2003, compared with net redemptions of R10,1 billion in 2002. The year-on-year growth in underlying bank credit extension to the private sector (i.e private sector credit extension excluding investments and bills discounted) rose from 7,8 per cent in December 2002 to around 12 per cent since April 2003 and amounted to 12,9 per cent in December. However, quarter-to-quarter growth in such advances slowed down from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 22,3 per cent in the second quarter of 2003 to 7,4 per cent in the fourth quarter. Growth in money supply remained relatively subdued. Growth over twelve months in the broadly defined money supply (M3) slowed down to a ten-year low of 5,1 per cent in August 2003, before picking up to 8,4 per cent in December. Similarly, the quarter-to-quarter seasonally adjusted and annualised growth in M3 declined from 13,1 per cent in the second quarter of 2003 to 4,4 per cent in the third quarter and rose to 9,5 per cent in the fourth quarter. This moderate growth in money supply reflected the low growth in domestic economic activity, the low inflation environment and lower interest rates on deposits of all maturities. To some extent it was also due to the substitution of investments in promissory notes of banks not included in money supply for investments in negotiable certificates of deposits which form part of money supply due to a change in the regulations regarding stamp duties payable on these instruments. Taking these factors into account, the central expectation of the Monetary Policy Committee is that CPIX inflation will remain within the target range during the forecast period while the economy continues to pick up momentum. Accordingly the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to maintain the current monetary policy stance and keep the repo rate unchanged at 8,0 per cent per annum. The Monetary Policy Committee will continue to monitor all the risk factors to the inflation outlook. If the outlook changes, the Committee will not hesitate to change the monetary policy stance."
Euroarea,2004-03-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome again to our monthly press conference. The Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Overall, the Governing Council confirmed its previous assessment of a favourable outlook for price stability in the euro area over the medium term. Against this background, we concluded that the current stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. The key ECB interest rates have therefore been left unchanged at their low levels. Our monetary policy stance provides support to the economic recovery in the euro area. We will continue to monitor carefully all developments that could affect our assessment of risks to price stability over the medium term. According to Eurostat, in the fourth quarter of 2003 real GDP in the euro area grew by 0.3% quarter on quarter, following growth of 0.4% in the third quarter. These data confirm that a gradual recovery in economic activity in the euro area took place in the second half of 2003. More recent indicators point to moderate economic growth also in early 2004. While growth has been relatively modest so far, both external and domestic factors give reason to expect a strengthening of the recovery through 2004 and beyond. On the external side, all recent indications confirm that global economic growth in 2004 will be robust and broadly based across different regions of the world. Overall, euro area exports should grow significantly this year and next. On the domestic side, the conditions for a recovery in private demand are in place. Over recent months there have been signs of a stabilisation in investment. According to Eurostat, fixed capital investment grew again in the last quarter of 2003, after recording three successive quarter-on-quarter declines. Corporate earnings have generally improved in the euro area, following a protracted restructuring of corporate balance sheets over the last few years. The financing conditions faced by corporations in the euro area are very favourable at present. All of these factors should support a further recovery in investment. There are also reasons to expect a gradual increase in consumption growth during this year, following the subdued developments of last year. In the short term, growth in real disposable income is supported by lower import prices and tax cuts, while later on the gradual improvement in labour market conditions should become an additional factor supporting income growth and confidence. The financial situation of households in the euro area is sound, not least in comparison with a number of other industrial economies, and there is no financial impediment to a pick-up in private consumption. For all these reasons, our main scenario of a continued gradual recovery in the course of 2004 and 2005 remains valid. This view is shared by available forecasts and projections, and is also broadly reflected in financial market developments. We continue to see the risks to this scenario as broadly balanced. However, there are uncertainties related to euro area private consumption and the persistent imbalances in some regions of the world and their potential repercussions on the sustainability of global economic growth. Turning to price developments, according to the Eurostat flash estimate, the annual HICP inflation rate declined to 1.6% in February 2004, from 1.9% in January. This fall was mainly due to base effects stemming from energy prices, as a sharp increase in oil prices which occurred in early 2003 dropped out of the calculation of the annual rate in February 2004. Over the coming months, volatility in annual inflation rates is likely to be observed, mainly due to further base effects from energy prices as well as to increases in indirect taxes. Related to this, annual inflation rates are likely to edge up again temporarily in the second quarter of 2004. Looking beyond short-term fluctuations in the most volatile components of the HICP, we expect inflation to remain in line with price stability. At the current juncture, we see little upward pressure on inflation. Given the anticipated gradual nature of the recovery in economic activity and the high level of unemployment in the euro area, wage developments should remain moderate. While our assessment is in line with available forecasts and projections, we are aware of the conditional nature of such exercises. Inflation expectations, in particular, deserve close attention. Turning to the monetary analysis. M3 growth has moderated over recent months. However, it appears that the reallocation of economic agents' portfolios into longer-term assets is proceeding rather cautiously. In this respect, the generally low level of interest rates continues to support the demand for liquid assets. The low level of interest rates also supports the growth of loans to the private sector. The high liquidity in the euro area needs to be assessed with caution. Its effects on inflation over the medium term will greatly depend on the extent and pace of the future reversal of past portfolio shifts and on the future strength of economic growth. Should excess liquidity persist, it could lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term. To sum up, the economic analysis continues to indicate that the main scenario for price developments in the coming years is in line with price stability. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis does not alter this picture for the time being. With regard to fiscal policies, we noted the progress in fiscal consolidation envisaged in countries' stability programmes. In some countries, contrary to their commitments, adjustment efforts are insufficient to mitigate the risk of excessive deficits. Moreover, several countries do not plan to attain sound budgetary positions by the end of their respective programme horizons, despite favourable growth prospects. This would risk a repetition of the policy errors of the last economic upswing, when insufficient consolidation efforts and tax cuts without adequate expenditure restraint laid the foundations for the recent fiscal difficulties. All countries would benefit from the strengthening of the sustainability of their public finances, especially in the expected upward phase of the cycle, by eliminating imbalances over the coming years and avoiding or correcting as soon as possible excessive deficits. Moreover, the determined implementation of comprehensive structural reforms, on both the expenditure side and the revenue side, will bring additional medium-term rewards in the form of higher growth and more sustainable public finances. Such consolidation and reform strategies are needed to secure a sound macroeconomic environment in the euro area. The euro area also requires further structural reforms in financial, product and labour markets. The Lisbon Strategy provides the appropriate blueprint for progress. We welcome that the forthcoming spring meeting of the European Council is set to give renewed impetus to the Lisbon agenda, speed up the pace of reforms, and strengthen the effectiveness of the decision-making process. Structural reforms will have enormous benefits for the citizens of the euro area. These reforms are crucial for sustained non-inflationary growth and employment, and they are therefore also important for maintaining social cohesion in the long run. Confidence among European citizens in the future is vital for a stronger economic recovery and sustained growth. The Governing Council recognises that the still low level of consumer confidence is related to prevailing uncertainties, including the debate about the appropriate path for structural reforms in many countries of the euro area. It is also partly linked to the continued perception by European citizens of higher inflation than measured by official indices. The Governing Council notes that inflation is now back at a level consistent with price stability. The European public can rest assured about our determination to preserve the purchasing power of our money in the years to come and thus make our contribution to enhance confidence in the future. Stable prices, together with further progress in the implementation of necessary structural reforms, are the key to stronger confidence, and they create the conditions for increased consumption and investment and thus for growth and job creation."
Peru,2004-03-04,"Press Release BOARD OF THE CENTRAL BANK APPROVED MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2004 REFERENCE INTEREST RATE IS KEPT AT 2.50% In February the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 1.09 percent. Cumulative inflation through last 12 month reached 3.4 percent, higher than in January (2.8 percent). However, core inflation, a price indicator that excludes high volatility items grew 1.9 percent over last 12 months. As mentioned in January Inflation Report, the rate of inflation is expected to rise temporarily the first months of the year, due to the increase of the international price of wheat and soybean oil as well as a shortage in the domestic agricultural supply (potato, rice, vegetables and sugar). Besides, an increase in the price of poultry was registered in February. The projections included in the January Inflation Report point out that inflation will meet the target of 2.5 percent for 2004. Interbank interest rate averaged 2.52 percent in February, higher than in January (2.41 percent) For March, the Board of the Central Bank decided to maintain the reference interest rates for monetary operations off auction: 3.25 percent: for direct repos and monetary regulation credits 1.75 percent: for overnight deposits. The monetary operations regarding injection or withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be made in order to place the interbank interest rate in the center of this corridor of reference interest rates (2.50 percent). In case the market interbank interest rate be higher than 3.25 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. For March, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCRP is 170  190 million. This balance is neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it is also affected by seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes. The interest rates for Central Bank‘s operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP's deposits held abroad Swaps, the commission that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.25 percent is maintained April Monetary Program will be approved in the Board of Directors meeting of April 7, 2004."
Philippines,2004-03-10,"At today's meeting, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The BSP's policy rates were last adjusted on 2 July 2003 when the rates were cut by 25 basis points. Based on its overall assessment of economic and financial indicators, the Monetary Board concluded that the current monetary policy stance remains appropriately supportive of the economy's low inflation growth path. The outlook for inflation over the policy horizon continued to be manageable with some downside risks such as the impact of volatile movements in international oil prices, transport fare adjustments and continuing pressures on the foreign exchange markets driven in part by political developments. The Board also noted the relative stability in the foreign exchange market. The decision to maintain the current monetary policy settings also reflects the Monetary Board's view that the present stance of monetary policy is appropriately supportive of the price stability and growth objectives of the economy. Furthermore, the Monetary Board believes that the current monetary policy is consistent with the need to ensure sufficient liquidity to sustain domestic demand. This requires that the general macroeconomic environment remains conducive to credit demand and investment activity and that financing conditions do not become unduly restrictive to loan activity. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor carefully all developments that could affect the monetary authorities' assessment of risks to inflation and inflation expectations over the policy horizon."
Chile,2004-03-11,"The Central Bank of Chile Press Release* Santiago, 11 March 2004 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 1.75% (annual). In the past two months. CPI inflation has followed the expected course, although core inflation figures (i.e. CPIX and CPIX1, which exclude some of the more volatile prices) have been slightly below previous forecasts. This contrasts with a somewhat higher oil price and a small depreciation of the peso. In this context, a gradual increase in annual inflation to 3% in the usual 24-month policy horizon continues to be expected, which includes monthly inflation rates approaching levels coherent with the target range in the coming months. Since the last policy meeting, the terms of trade have continued to improve, thanks to the large and unexpected increase in the price of copper, amidst openly expansionary global financial conditions. However, domestic activity figures for the first quarter reveal lower dynamism than previously expected. The performance of mining and manufacturing sectors, together with the still sluggish expansion of investment, explain this result. Overall, these developments are insufficient to warrant a change in the growth projections for the year contained in the last Monetary Policy Report The Central Bank of Chile reiterates that it will continue to conduct monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to address any projected inflation deviations in either direction from the specified target inflation rate. In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2004-03-11,"Private consumption and facilities investment still show downward movements, whereas industrial production has exhibited solid growth driven by strong exports. Overall, the real economy continues to show signs of a gradual improvement. Core inflation has remained stable owing to the sluggishness of domestic demand. However, consumer and producer price inflation continued to show a relatively rapid rise mainly due to the upswing in the prices of international raw materials and seasonal factors. The current account surplus is estimated to have been similar in scale to the previous month's, due to the continued large surplus on the goods account. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions have been favorable due to subdued demand for funds. However, fund-raising conditions have remained difficult for small- and medium-sized corporations with a low credit rating. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.75 percent) for the intermeeting period."
United States,2004-03-16,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent. The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid pace. Although job losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged. Increases in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson.

Thailand,2004-03-17,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 17 March 2004 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. The MPC reviewed the latest data on economic conditions in Thailand and deemed that economic growth in 2003 of 67 per cent had been strong, with continued strength in domestic spending helping to support a 78 per cent expansion in economic activity in the last quarter of 2003. The growth momentum continued into January 2004, despite some decline in consumer and investor confidence following news of the avian flu outbreak, with further expansion in domestic demand and export values at a buoyant level. External stability remained strong with the current account continuing in surplus, international reserves at a high level, and further reductions in the level of foreign debt. Internal stability remained satisfactory. Headline inflation increased to 22 per cent year-on-year in February from 12 per cent in the previous month on the back of higher raw food and energy prices. Core inflation edged up to 02 per cent year-on-year in February after the 01 per cent decline registered in January. The MPC assessed that the overall economic growth process continued to be sound. There are neither clear evidence of accumulating financial imbalances at the sectoral level, nor signs of economic overheating that could adversely affect economic stability going forward. While there could be some upward price pressures from higher production costs and stronger demand, the MPC expected core inflation to remain within the target band. The MPC deemed that the current policy stance and prevailing rates of interest are appropriate for current economic conditions and, therefore, decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 125 per cent per annum."
Nigeria,2004-03-20,"PRESS RELEASE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 33 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE FOR MARCH 2004 In keeping with the Bank's policy of transparency in the conduct of monetary and financial policies, the Central Bank of Nigeria hereby publishes a summary of the deliberations and decisions of its Monetary Policy Committee in March, 2004. The Committee met once during the month and reviewed developments in the macro economy and the financial market in February 2004. The overall macroeconomic environment showed some improvement, as the monetary aggregates showed further contraction; the foreign exchange market remained generally stable, with the naira recording a modest appreciation and, the official gross external reserves improved significantly. Moreover the level of interest rates showed further moderations. review of monetary developments indicated that the broad measure of money supply (M ) fell by 28 per cent to N1, 9595 billion, 2 compared with the 02 per cent decline recorded in the preceding month. In the corresponding period of 2003, the M , however, increased by 18 2 per cent. In addition, narrow money (M ) fell by 49 per cent during the 1 review month, compared with the 32 per cent rise recorded a month earlier. The main contractionary factor of broad money supply during the month under review was the substantial fall in bank credit to the domestic economy, mainly the CBN's net claim on the Federal Government. The development was explained by the rapid increase in the Federal Government's deposits with the CBN to a level, which more than offset Government's gross indebtedness to the Bank. Credit to the private sector, on the other hand, rose by11 per cent, compared with the 34 per cent increase observed in the preceding month. The moderation in demand pressure on the foreign exchange market observed in January continued into February, 2004. Thus total foreign exchange sales in the Dutch Auction System (DAS) segment of the market remained virtually unchanged at the January level, rising by only 04 per cent to US$7801 million. Consequently the naira exchange rate firmed and, in fact culminated in the appreciation to N13500 per US $100 in February from N1353 in January, 2004. Over the same period, the naira appreciated even more substantially in the Bureaux De Change (BDC), rising from N14779 to N14295 per US$100. Helped by the appreciable increase in foreign exchange inflow and moderation in the demand, the official external reserves of the country rose substantially by 112 per cent to US$935 billion as at end-February 2004. That level of external reserves could finance up to 81 months of foreign exchange disbursements. In February, 2004 activities in the money market remained generally calm, as in the preceding month. Actual data on interest rates movement, 2 as at mid-February 2004, showed that bank deposits and lending rates declined generally. The average savings deposit rate, for example, declined marginally by 012 percentage point to 34 per cent, while the average prime and maximum bank lending rates moderated by 029 and 167 percentage points to 1920 and 1990 per cent, respectively. Moreover the weighted average inter-bank call money rate fell from 1226 per cent in January 2004 to 1085 per cent, reflecting the surfeit of funds in the market, relative to the demand. Although inflation data for January and February 2004 were not available, preliminary indicators showed that the risk of further increase in domestic price level was marginal. Encouraged by that, coupled with the contraction in the broad money supply since the beginning of 2004, the Committee observed that the prospects of bringing the rate of inflation down was high if fiscal prudence was sustained. Meanwhile the Committee decided to continue monitoring developments in the economy with a view to fine-tuning the existing policies, if necessary.

Israel,2004-03-29,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program forApril 2004. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for April 2004, according to which the interest rate will be reduced by 0.2 percentage points to 4.1 percent. This brings the cumulative reduction in the Bank of Israel's interest rate since December 2002 to 5 percentage points. This reduction in the interest rate is consistent with the need to bring inflation into the price-stability range of 1 to 3 percent a year and to stabilize it there. Inflationexpectations, as derived from the bond yields on the capital market, are still in the area of the lower limit of the target, at around 1.2 percent. Private forecasters' predictions of 12-month inflation reached about 1.8 percent. These developments regarding the inflation rate are also supported by the slow weakening of the NIS against the dollar, and its faster depreciation against the currency basket, in the first quarter of the year. Concurrently, there was continuedstability in the financial markets in general and in the foreign-currency market in particular. Assessments of the development of fiscal policy over the year suggest that the budget target set by the government at 4 percent of GDP is attainable. These assessments arealso reflected by the financial markets, and especially by the changes in the yields on bonds issued by the government to finance the deficit. Together with continued financial stability, the resilience of the economy is also recognized by the international capital markets. The financial risk of Israel\'s economy: as viewed by Israeli and foreign investors, as expressed in the latest publications by international financial companies and as measured by the 5-year credit-default-swap (CDS) market:. Another sign of the economy's stability, in particular as it is an economy open to capital flows,is the public's gradual adjustment of its financial assets portfolio, against the background of the lowering of the interest rate, the reform of income tax on individuals, and the completion of the foreign exchange liberalization process. This adjustment reflects the public's desire to spread its investments between local and foreign assets, and between bank deposits and capital-market investments, and thereby to reduce the risks of these investments and even improve their rates of return. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor with a very watchful eye the spread that has widened in the last three months between long-term and short-term yields on the domestic capital market. Thus, for example, the yield spread between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year Shahar bonds that stood at 2.1 percentage points in December 2003, reached 3.1 percentage points in March 2004. The persistent widening of this spread, at a time when the money supply is rising, is inconsistent with price-stability in the long run. The persistent lowering of the interest rate since the end of 2002 helps bring about sustainable growth while maintaining price and financial stability. In this context is should be emphasized that the reduction of the Bank of Israel interest rate, combined with the rise in expected inflation to within the price-stability target, creates a process of reducing short-term real interest. This interest went down from 7.2 percent in December 2002 to 4.6 percent in December 2003, and continued declining to reach 3.3 percent in March 2004. Thus the interest-rate policy contributes to the achievement of the central objective of economic policy. The Bank of Israel's interest rate continues to be lower than the interest rates in several advanced economies (Australia, and New Zealand), and similar to the rate in the UK. It is also similar to the average rate of central banks in emerging markets and other developing economies. This comparison with the interest rates of a wide range of countries is important because short-term capital flows into and out of the economy (by domestic and foreign investors) are affected by changes in interest rates in the various emerging markets and developing economies. The Bank of Israel\'s current interest-rate policy will continue as long as the inflation path isconsistent with the government's price-stability target and the financial markets continue to exhibit stability and financial resilience. The risk premium, as measured by the 5-year credit-default-swap (CDS) market remained 60 basis points, similar to its level a monthearlier. The yield spread between 10-year Shahar bonds and 10-year US government bonds.

Poland,2004-03-31,"Warsaw, 31 March 2004 INFORMATION FROM A MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 30 - 31 March 2004 On 30 - 31 March 2004 the Monetary Policy Council held a meeting. The Council read materials prepared by the Management Board and the NBP Departments, as well as information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council discussed the external environment of the Polish economy as well as real trends, trends in payments and social welfare benefits, trends in the public finance sector, trends in the money supply, loans and interest rates, and the formation of pricing and inflationary expectations as well as inflationary prospects. In February 2004 the annual indicator was 1.6%, as in January 2004. The economic data for the period since the last Monetary Policy Council meeting of February 2004 indicate: I Continuing presence of some factors supporting the continuation of a low inflation level: continued moderate money supply level; annual rate of growth of the M3 aggregate increased by 4.9% in February 2004 against 5.1% in January 2004, continued low growth rate in corporate loans; its annual rate of growth rate in February 2004 was at 2.3% against 2.4% in January 2004. The annual growth rate for households was at 14.1% and 13.8% respectively; its growth was influenced foremost by an increase in housing loans. accelerates growth of labour efficiency in the corporate sector; it increased in industry as a whole by 19.4% on an annual basis (15.3% in January of this year), while in the processing industry by 23.7% (in January of this year by 18.3%). II. Growth trends in the economy are clearly consolidating. The Polish economy is currently in a revival phase, stimulated by rapidly increasing export. If the consumption trend is maintained at a level close to that of 2003, one can expect a continuance of growth trends in the economy for the next few years. This will gradually increase inflationary pressure. Growth in the long term basically depends on the implementation of specific structural reforms. in February 2004, as compared to February 2003, industrial production was as a whole greater by 18.4% and with 23.3% for the processing industry. After seasonal trends, the growth in production as a whole was 17.0%, with 21.4% in the processing industry. The growth trend in production strengthened in the processing industry (with annual growth rate at 18.9%) as well as in industry as a whole (15.0%), continued high growth rate in exports; in accordance with payments statistics in January 2004, there was an 11.6% growth of exports denominated in euro and 32.8% growth of exports denominated in USD, results of March survey on the general condition of enterprises indicates continuing improvement in the general market trends of the processing industry, retail sales growth of 12.1% on an annual basis was reported in February 2004, in comparison with 7.6% for the previous month, according to GUS data, the corporate financial situation in 2003 was significantly more favorable than in 2002. There was an improvement in all of the efficiency 1 indicators and an increase in the share of companies showing a net profit. The results in operational activities of the corporate sector in 2003 increased in comparison with that of 2002 by 86%, while the gross financial results increased more than four times. GUS data indicate stagnation in construction-assembly production. However, there has been significant improvement in corporate financial results, investment increase in the processing industry and an observed significant increase in the sales of cement and other construction materials indicate the possibility of increasing expenditures on investments in the economy. III. There has been no change to the importance of factors hampering the stabilisation of inflation at a low level. The Council re-emphasizes that the most important of these is the state of public finances. A high budget deficit, increasing governmental loan requirements, risk of not introducing the programme for the reduction of current expenditures and the rationalization of their structure are the source of continued uncertainty on financial markets leading to an increase in the yield of treasury securities and the weakening of the zloty exchange rate. As of the last meeting of the Council, i.e. from 25 February to 26 March 2004 the zloty strengthened against the euro by 1.96% and weakened by 0.64% against the USD, which does not, however, change the fact that the zloty remains clearly weaker than in the corresponding period of the previous year. The Council re-emphasizes, that fundamental, swift and effective reforms leading to a recovery of public finances are indispensable for avoiding debt build-up that threatens exceeding prudential thresholds specified in the Public Finance Act that would prevent rapid economic growth and lower unemployment. According to current NBP estimates, there is a great likelihood of exceeding the second prudential threshold, i.e. 55% of the GDP already in 2004. Against these threats, the Council notes with disquiet increasing political instability that may hamper the passage of laws necessary for the recovery of public finances. IV. Other possible factors of inflationary pressure: growth in inflationary expectations reported in the course of the past four months. Individual inflation rate expectations on a 12-month basis increase from 1.6% in December 2003 to 2,4% in March of this year. The inflation forecast of bank analysts on an 11-month basis increased from 2.5% to 2.8% respectively, increase in oil price forecast. Actual forecast of the average annual price of oil in 2004 was increased by 1.3 USD/b in comparison with that forecast in February 2004. From September 2003 to March 2004 the forecast of oil price increased 26.0 USD/b to 30.7 USD/b, growth in price of foodstuffs in 2004 may be greater than that indicated in actually available forecasts. This indicates, amongst others, increasing expectations of food sector businesses that there will be higher shop prices, growth in the PPI indicator that in February increased by 0.6% and was 4.1% on an annual basis, similarly as in January of this year, high rate of cash in circulation. In February 2004 the annual rate of growth of this aggregate was 16.1% (16.6% in January). growth in salaries; average annual growth rate of monthly gross salary in the corporate sector increased from 5.1% in December of last year and 3.5% in January of this year to 6.3% in February of this year. The salaries fund in the corporate sector grew in February by 4.8% on an annual basis, i.e. the highest increase since May 2001 (5.6%), 2 Decision of the Monetary Policy Council The Council resolved: To leave the monetary parameters unchanged and maintain its neutral approach to monetary policy. The Council does not exclude the possibility of adopting a restrictive approach at the next meeting. TThe next meeting of the Council will take place 26  27 April 2004 External factors February and March 2004 saw a worsening of the economic climate in the main regions of Worsening of global economy. This was reflected in the lowering of business confidence indicators (in the global USA and in the euro area) and in consumer confidence (in the USA), which, however, on the economic whole remain at high levels. This situation is mainly the result of worse than expected USA confidence employment market data, while in the euro area with a less optimistic prognosis for sales in the corporate sector which are under an ever greater influence of the common European currency appreciation. Analysts do not expect an improvement in confidence in the next few months also because of an increase in geopolitical risk after the Madrid attacks. March 2004 noted an increased demand for low risk assets on financial markets that was reflected in a greater drop in the profitability of treasury bonds and lower stock exchange indexes. There was a significant increase in the exchange rate fluctuations of the main global currencies. In light of the above phenomena, there was a clear lowering of expectations for a rate increase in the USA and in the euro area. In February 2004 the average price of Brent oil was 30.9 USD/b and was slightly lower High oil prices in comparison with that of January 2004. However since the beginning of the second part of on world February there was clear rise in prices resulting from the OPEC announcement of production markets limitations. The first half of March 2004 the price of oil stabilized at a high level (about 34 USD/b). At the same time the Department of State for Energy increased in March of this year its forecast of oil prices for 2004 to 30.7 USD/b (an increase of 1.3 USD/b in comparison with the forecast for February 2004). Economic situation in Poland The corporate financial situation in 2003 has been significantly more favorable than in Very good 2002. This is demonstrated in the improvement of all efficiency indicators and an increased corporate percentage of companies showing a net profit (more than 7 percentage points). financial The corporate sector’s operational activity results in 2003 increased by 86% in results comparison with that of 2002, while the gross financial results more than four times. The net in 2003 financial result in 2003 was at PLN 18 billion with PLN 2 billion in losses incurred by the corporate sector in 2002. In comparison with 2002, losses from financial activity decreased (by about 5%) while at the same time there was a profit increase on the sale of products, goods and materials (by 53%). An improvement in the level of the costs indicators and the net and gross profitability turnover indicators were noted in all sections with the exception of health protection and social welfare. There was also an improvement in the economic-financial condition of exporters where the basic factors of effectiveness were in that group of enterprises more favorable than in enterprises as a whole (with the exception of liquidity indicators). Improvement In January 2004 there was a decrease in the current account deficit. In comparison with in current January of the previous year it decreased by EUR 260 million and amounted to EUR 80 account million. The decrease in the negative current account balance was mainly an influence of the balance deficit decrease in the turnover of goods and the appearance of a positive balance on the side of earnings that was connected with an increase in earnings from the central bank’s reserve assets. Another favorable influence on the balance of earnings was the seasonal decrease in expenditures. The negative balance in the turnover of goods decreased in January 2004 by EUR 130 million. This was a result of a continuation of a higher export growth rate (11.6% in comparison with January 2003) than for import (increase of 7.3%). The January 2003 growth trend in the turnover of goods (both in export and to a greater degree in import) was clearly greater in comparison with the average trend in 2003. A strong increase in the value of imports was responsible for the fact that the balance of the turnover in goods was in January 2004 3 weaker than the average in 2003. Industrial production increased in February by 18.4%. Similarly, as in previous months, the high growth trend in industrial production stemmed from strong sales in the processing industry that was 23.3% above the level of last year. After eliminating the influence of seasonal factors the increase in production on the whole was 17.0% while in the processing Industrial industry 21.4%. Gradually one can observe changes to the divisional structure of growth in production the processing industry. As previously, high growth rate was reported in export sales divisions growth in with large foreign capital participation. There was record increase in sales in the motors February, industry, resulting partly from low automobile sales in February of last year (80%). Also, higher than within the group of dynamically growing divisions prevail those with domestic capital (metals expected production and iron goods), taking advantage of increasing world prices and low exchange rate of the zloty. A nearly double increase in sales was noted in the stockyard industry. One can assess that an increase in this division increased the growth trend of the industry as a whole by about 1 point percentage. Despite significantly better weather conditions in comparison with the previous year, construction-assembly production fell in February on an annual basis by 6.3% (as against a loss of 24.2% in February of last year). Moreover, the corrected data for January in accordance with the actual GUS estimates, in January of this year construction sales were lower than in the previous year by 16.8%. The GUS study published on 19 March 2004 shows a further improvement of the general Improvement condition of the processing industry. The assessment of the condition in comparison with the in condition of analogical month of previous years achieved a record level and was one of the highest for the processing entire period studied. However in construction further deterioration was noted in the negative industry assessment of the condition both in respect to February of this year as well as in comparison with assessments formulated in March for the entire period studied. There was a continued negative assessment of the condition in retail trade but it was better than in the analogical period of the previous year. Industrial entrepreneurs (especially producers of supply goods) and traders (mainly in the furniture branch and food products) are expecting an increase in sale prices in the next three months, while in construction enterprises an opinion is maintained that such a possibility is lacking. The annual growth trend of the average monthly gross salary in the enterprise sector, which increased from 5.1% in December of last year and from 3.5% in January of this year to 6.3% in February of this year, was amongst others a result of high payments in coal-mining and mining where as a result of the so-called 14 salaries the average salary increased nominally by 28%. The salaries fund in the enterprise sector has been increasing nominally for the past four months, while in real terms it has been increasing since January of this year. In February of this year in comparison with February 2003 it was higher by 4.8% in nominal terms and by 3.1% in real terms. In February of this year an increase in labour efficiency was noted; in industry as a whole it increased by 19.4%, while in the processing industry by 23.7%. Condition of public finance sector The state budget revenue were higher by 3% compared to the analogical period last year which can be accepted as a good result in face of its forecast annual increase of 1.2%. The degree of annual revenue plan realization was also higher than last year’s level (14.8%). The high increase in indirect taxes (7.1% year on year) had the greatest influence by far on the formation of the state budget revenue in the 1st and 2nd quarters of this year, with an especially strong influence in February (about 15% year on year). It probably resulted from the weakening of the zloty exchange rate as against the dollar and euro that causes increased inflow from taxes on imports and an increase of domestic demand, including demand for goods which will be subject to higher VAT rate as of May 1 of this year. Moreover, the size of indirect taxes was also influenced by higher inflow from the excise tax on the increased tax rates on engines fuel and tobacco products. The budget expenditures in February of this year were nominally lower by 4.7% than Low advance the expenditures last year. This was connected with a lack of subvention for the FP (Labour in expenditures Fund) from the beginning of this year and a limitation of subvention for FUS (Social Security and state Fund) in February of this year. Expenditures on servicing the public debt were lower (by budget deficit 15.2%) than the level in the previous year mainly because of lower costs on the domestic debt after two (by 33.4%). As a result, the realization of the annual revenue plan of the budget expenditures months of 2004 4 reached 16.2% which means significantly less than in the previous years. The state budget deficit at the end of February was at the level of PLN 9.4 billion which means that 20.7% of the annual limit has been utilised , compared to 30% in the previous year. Despite the good results of the state budget after February of this year, the state budget condition for the year 2004 will be determined only in the months after Poland’s European Union accession and connected with this the introduction of new systemic solutions on the side of revenues (changes to tax provisions) as well as budgetary expenditures (membership fee to the EU budget). A change to time limits on the settlement of the VAT tax (import tax can even be settled with a two month delay) and the introduction of a system of excise depots, will cause a loss in revenues in May and June of this year. In part, the influence of these changes will be compensated from EU sources, the so-called budgetary compensation and transfers for adjusting the internal border, however, the compensation from this title (about PLN 0.3 billion) will not significantly lessen the budgetary liquidity problems. On the other hand, after May 1 of this year, the state budget will be required to transfer the member fee to the EU budget, which means an increase in the monthly expenditures by about PLN 0.7 billion. At the same time, there exists the additional danger of not fulfilling the inflow from indirect taxation due to negative budgetary results from the parliamentary process on the law regulating the VAT rates (by about PLN 0.8 billion). Moreover, the valorization costs of pension and disability payments will be higher than planned (buy about PLN 0.5 billion) as well as the EU membership fees in case there is a continuance of an unfavorable zloty exchange rate as against the euro. In light of the above factors, there decreases the likelihood of undertaking the announced steps that have as their goal decreasing the state budget in 2004 by about PLN 3 billion. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate According to figures presented in forward information, in February of this year the M3 money supply increased by about PLN 3.1 billion (0.9%). It was observed this month that the significant weakening of the zloty had a great influence on the formation of the M3 aggregate. After eliminating the influence of fluctuating exchange rates the M3 increase in February amounted to about PLN 2.1 billion (0.6%). The annual growth rate of M3 aggregate amounted to 4.9% in February 2004 compared to 5.1% in January 2004. The state of cash in circulation, after the January decrease of PLN 0.9 billion, increased by PLN 1.1 billion in February of this year (2.2%). The increase in the state of cash in circulation in February after the January decreases is a phenomena observed annually; the size of this year’s increase was comparable to the average increase observed in previous years. The annual rate of growth of cash in circulation remained high and amounted to 16.1%. The household deposits increased in February of this year by PLN 1.6 billion (0.8%) and after removing the influence of exchange rate fluctuations by about PLN 0.8 billion (0.4%). The annual rate of growth of this category amounted to - 1.3%. An increase in household financial assets, which are an alternative to bank deposits (assets of investment funds, deposits in Skok, bonds and treasury bonds), remained moderate in February of this year. According to actual data the balance of payments and redemption of investment fund units amounted to about PLN 0.3 billion in February of this year. The significant January decrease in bank deposits did not reflected in an assets growth of investment funds, which amounted to only about PLN 0.3 billion. Each year February is characterized by a decrease in corporate deposits. In the current year their state decreased by PLN 0.6 billion (1%) and after eliminating the influence of exchange rate fluctuations by about PLN 0.9 billion. The annual rate of growth in this category continues for six months at a level of above 20%, amounting in February of this year to 22%. Also in February there was an increase of PLN 1.2 billion (11.6%) in the deposits of self- government institutions, which is typical for this month and results from the schedule for transferring subventions from governmental institutions of the central government. The indebtedness of the banking sector to non-banking entities increased in February of Low growth this year by PLN 1.8 billion (0.7%), however, this increase was in its entirety a result of the rate for weakening of the zloty. After eliminating exchange rate fluctuations the state of indebtedness corporate did not change in comparison with January. Household loans increased in February by PLN loans; 0.6 billion (0.6%), after clearing it of the influence of exchange rate fluctuations its state moderate for decreased by PLN 0.1 billion. This decrease in comparable conditions was identical to that of households 5 last year. The annual indebtedness growth rate for households amounted in February to 14.1%, although this increase, similarly as in the previous month, was due mainly to an increase in housing credits. The nominal increase in corporate indebtedness amounted in February of this year to PLN 0.8 billion (0.6%) and after eliminating exchange rate fluctuations this category decreased by PLN 0.2 billion. The annual rate of growth for corporate loans continues at a low level; in February of this year it amounted to 2.3%. In the period of 25 February to 26 March 2004 the zloty strengthened against the euro by 1.96% and weakened against the dollar by 0.64% (from the beginning of the year the EUR/PLN and USD/PLN exchange rates rose by 0.55% and 4.21% respectively). As a result, the zloty exchange rate expressed in categories of the currency basket strengthened from the level of 3.3% to 2.4%. Positive macroeconomic data (especially the current account balance being below market expectations) and the acceptance by the Sejm on first reading of laws connected with the programme for the reform and limitation of public expenditures contributed to the reversal of the downward trend of the zloty exchange rate which was observed in February. Fluctuation in benchmark bond prices decreased from the last meeting of the MPC. The yield on 2-year, 5-year and 10-year bonds decreased in this period by 4, 11 and 14 b.p. respectively (from the beginning of the year this change was 15, - 1 and 14 b.p. respectively). The stabilisation of 2-year bond yields resulted from continued expectation of NBP rate Market increase after the MPC announced the possibility of adopting a restrictive approach to stabilization of monetary policy. The far end of the yield curve was positively influenced by the decline in the Treasury bonds yield of government bonds on global markets and information indicating that the programme for the reform and limitation of public expenditures may gain political support in Parliament. For the first time since October 2003. March saw a tender for 10-year bonds. Despite a minor advantage of buyers the tender price of the bonds did not depart from market prices, and the tender had a stabilising influence on the secondary market. Prices, inflationary expectations In February 2004 the annual CPI was 1.6%, as in January of this year. In comparison with February 2003, the highest increase in prices was in foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages (2.7%), prices in transport (2.4%), prices for apartment usage (2.8%), which resulted foremost from the price increase of power carriers (3.1%). Prices of clothing and footwear, however, were lower than in February 2003 The net inflation in February 2004 on an annual basis amounted to 1.1%, while in January this indicator amounted to 1.2%. Amongst five measurements of base inflation indicators on an annual basis increased, one decreased and one remained without change. After an increase of 0.6% in the PPI in comparison with January of this year, the annual growth rate of the PPI continued at an unchanged level and amounted in February of this year to 4.1%. This indicator has remained at the highest level since January 2001. The greatest influence on the indicator of prices of industrial production sold in February 2004 has been the increase in industrial raw materials (industrial metals, oil, coal) on global markets and the growth in export prices that is connected with the weakening of the zloty against the euro and the currency basket. There has been an increase in the inflation expectations of individuals and bank analysts. The inflation rate expectations of individuals in March of this year, within the next 12 months. Increase in amounts to 2.4% (by 0.2 point percentage more than in the previous month). Bank analysts inflation forecast that in December 2004 the inflation rate will be 2.7% (with no changes), in February expectations 2005 at 2,8% (increase of 0.2 point percentage), while the average annual rate of inflation in 2005 at 2.8% (increase of 0.2 point percentage)."
Euroarea,2004-04-01,"Before I proceed. I would like to remind you that I have conveyed the Governing Council's sincere condolences to Jaime Caruana. Governor of the Banco de España, following the terrorist attacks in Madrid on 11 March 2004. I assured him of the Governing Council's total solidarity with the Spanish people and the Banco de España. The Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analysis, we have not changed our assessment that the current stance of monetary policy remains in line with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term. Accordingly, the key ECB interest rates have been left unchanged. The low level of interest rates also provides ongoing support to the economic recovery in the euro area. We will continue to monitor carefully all developments that could affect our assessment of risks to price stability over the medium term. Let me now provide a more detailed explanation of our decision, turning first to the economic analysis. With regard to real GDP growth, it appears that the recovery in the euro area has continued into 2004, following quarter-on-quarter growth rates of 0.3-0.4% in the second half of 2003. Recently released data on production and demand as well as confidence indicators have been mixed, implying some short-term uncertainty, while preliminary information available after the tragic events in Madrid on 11 March does not suggest a major impact on confidence. On balance, there is currently no evidence challenging the assessment of continued, though modest, real GDP growth in the euro area over the short term. More fundamentally, the conditions remain in place for the recovery to continue in 2004 and to strengthen over time. First, global economic growth is robust and broadly based, both geographically and across sectors, thereby providing a positive external environment for the euro area. In this context, we expect euro area exports to grow significantly this year and next, despite some past losses in price competitiveness. Second, on the domestic side, investment should be helped by favourable financing conditions, an improvement in corporate earnings and spillover effects from global demand trends. Some signs of an improvement in fixed capital investment are already discernible in the Eurostat data for the fourth quarter of last year. As regards private consumption, growth in real disposable income should lead to increased spending, in particular because there are no financial constraints for households which would pose obstacles to higher expenditure. Over time this should also be fostered by an improvement in employment and employment expectations. This is our assessment and it is supported by the available forecasts and projections. Obviously, any such forward-looking evaluation is conditional and subject to risks. At this juncture, risks are primarily related to the persistent imbalances in some regions of the world and the weakness of private consumption in the euro area. Concerning private consumption. European citizens who still perceive that inflation is higher than measured by official indices should be assured that the official measures are accurate and that we will continue to maintain price stability in the future. Moreover, the prevailing uncertainties surrounding fiscal policies and structural reforms in some euro area countries may have had a negative impact on consumer sentiment. Ensuring clarity about the content and timing of these reforms and a better understanding of their benefits to all citizens would make a very important contribution to supporting household confidence. Turning to price developments, we expect some short-term volatility in HICP inflation rates to continue. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual inflation in the HICP was 1.6% in March, unchanged from February and down from 1.9% in January. However, over the coming months, annual inflation rates could edge up again, on account of less favourable base effects and increases in indirect taxes. Looking beyond these short-term fluctuations, we expect price developments to remain in line with price stability. Given the anticipated gradual pace of the economic recovery, wage developments should remain moderate. The latest data on wage growth in the fourth quarter of 2003 lend support to this view. Moreover, the past appreciation of the euro exchange rate will continue to alleviate import price pressures and dampen the inflationary impact of higher oil and commodity prices, which are also related to strong demand at the global level. Again, this outlook for price developments is in line with available forecasts and projections. Given their conditional nature, we will continue to monitor all indicators closely. In particular, the increase in commodity prices and the evolution of long-term inflation expectations deserve close attention. Turning to the monetary analysis, annual M3 growth has been moderating since the summer of 2003, though only slowly. At the same time, the growth of loans to the private sector has been edging up. Both monetary and credit growth seem to be supported by the low level of interest rates prevailing in the euro area and may also reflect the improvement in the economic environment since the summer of 2003. Given the strong M3 growth over the past few years, there is currently more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth. The effects of this high liquidity on inflation over the medium term will greatly depend on future developments in the economy and financial markets. Should excess liquidity persist, it could lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term. To conclude, the economic analysis continues to indicate that the outlook for price developments in the medium term is in line with price stability. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis does not alter this picture. Let me also make a few remarks on other policies in the euro area. With regard to fiscal policies, the Governing Council sees continued reasons for concern. Recent information indicates that significant imbalances are emerging in a growing number of countries and that current policies would not be sufficient to attain the consolidation objectives specified in the latest stability programmes. We strongly urge governments to take corrective action in a timely and sustained fashion, where and when necessary. Finally, with regard to structural reforms, the Governing Council welcomed the Presidency conclusions of last weekend's Brussels European Council. Structural reforms are necessary to meet the Lisbon challenge and thus reap the benefits of higher sustainable growth and employment. As pointed out by the European Council, the pace of reform needs to be significantly stepped up and the critical issue now is the need for better implementation of commitments already made. Ending the political uncertainty and delays surrounding the implementation of sustainable fiscal policies and effective structural reforms would indeed support private sector confidence, which would add momentum to the economic recovery in the euro area, given the supportive stance of monetary policy."
Peru,2004-04-01,"Press Release BOARD OF THE CENTRAL BANK APPROVED MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2004 REFERENCE INTEREST RATE IS KEPT AT 2,50% In March the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.46 percent. Cumulative inflation through last 12 month reached 2.8 percent, lower than in February (3.4 percent). Core inflation, a price indicator that excludes high volatility items was 2.3 percent over last 12 months. As mentioned in January Inflation Report, inflation is expected to rise over the first months of the year due to the increase in the international prices of some foods (wheat and soybean oil) as well as a shortage of domestic agricultural supply (potato, rice, vegetables and sugar). An additional factor is the recent hike in international oil quotations. However, annual inflation as of December 2004 would remain within the target range (2.5 percent with a plus/less 1 percent margin). The average interbank interest rate was 2.48 percent in March, similar to that seen in February (2.52 percent). For April, the Board of the Central Bank decided to maintain the reference interest rates for monetary operations off auction: 3.25 percent: for direct repos and monetary regulation credits 1.75 percent: for overnight deposits. The monetary operations regarding injection or withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be made in order to place the interbank interest rate in the center of this corridor of reference interest rates (2.50 percent). In case the market interbank interest rate be higher than 3.25 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. For April, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCRP is 170 - 190 million. This balance is neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it is also affected by seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes. The interest rates for Central Bank‘s operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP's deposits held abroad Swaps, the commission that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.25 percent is maintained May Monetary Program will be approved in the Board of Directors meeting of May 6, 2004."
South Korea,2004-04-08,"Despite the continuing sluggishness of private consumption, industrial production has maintained a fast pace driven by the rapid expansion of exports. Moreover, facilities investment appears mildly improved. The real economy as a whole now shows signs of a gradual upswing. Core inflation has remained stable owing to the subdued domestic demand. Both consumer and producer price inflation, though, have continued to show a rapid rise largely in response to the run-up in prices for internationally-traded raw materials and for livestock and poultry products. The current account is estimated to have registered a relatively large surplus in March, owing to the widened surplus on the goods account. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions have been favorable due to the persistently low demand for funds. However, delinquency ratios have risen on loans to households and small- and medium-sized corporations and financial institutions' risk aversion from low-rated corporations has not lessened. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.75 percent) for the intermeeting period."
Philippines,2004-04-14,"At today's meeting, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The BSP's policy rates were last adjusted on 2 July 2003 when the rates were cut by 25 basis points. In its assessment of prevailing economic and financial conditions, the Monetary Board concluded that the current monetary policy stance remains appropriately supportive of the economy's low-inflation growth path and the macroeconomic environment remains generally conducive to credit demand. The Monetary Board is of the view that cost-side factors continue to represent the principal sources of risk to the inflation outlook. These factors include the recent increase in transport fares, proposed adjustments in utility charges, and the observed calls for increases in the minimum wage rate by various labor groups. Inflationary pressures resulting from cost-side factors are largely outside the influence of monetary policy, and therefore do not require action from monetary authorities. Meanwhile, the presence of inflation risks from sentiment-driven volatile movements in the nominal exchange rate implies that the policy stance should contain an element of caution, taking into consideration the potential risks to real sector activity. At the same time, the double-digit unemployment rate, the remaining unused capacity in the manufacturing sector as well as the still modest growth in exports and bank lending over the past several quarters suggest that demand-driven pressures on consumer prices are likely to remain subdued over the near term. In light of these conditions, the Monetary Board believes that the balance of demand- and supply-side risks to inflation points to a continued manageable environment for inflation over the policy horizon. After due consideration of prevailing inflationary risks, the Monetary Board expects average inflation for 2004 and 2005 to lie within the Government's inflation target of 4-5 percent. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor carefully all developments that may affect the assessment of risks to inflation and inflation expectations over the policy horizon. Monetary policy will continue to focus on ensuring price stability while remaining supportive of the economy's growth objective."
Chile,2004-04-15,"The Central Bank of Chile Press Release* Santiago, 15 April 2004 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 1.75% (annual). Since the last policy meeting, substantially improved world economic conditions have consolidated, particularly the higher copper price. Also, recent domestic activity and demand figures, especially in the manufacturing sector, exports and imports of capital goods, indicate that the lower dynamism observed at the last meeting was transitory. This supports the growth projections contained in the last Monetary Policy Report. Although CPI inflation has been in line with projections in January's Report, core inflation readings for the first quarter (i.e. CPIX and CPIX1, which exclude some of the more volatile prices) have been lower than expected. These developments do not change the projection of annual inflation gradually converging to 3% in the usual 24-month policy horizon. However, this process could end up being slower than previously forecasted. In this context, the Board considers that expansionary monetary conditions may last somewhat longer. The Central Bank of Chile reiterates that it will continue to conduct monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to address any projected inflation deviations in either direction from the specified target inflation rate. In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
Nigeria,2004-04-20,"PRESS RELEASE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 34 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE IN APRIL 2004 The Central Bank of Nigeria hereby publishes a summary of the deliberations and decisions of its Monetary Policy Committee in April 2004. The Committee met once in the month and reviewed developments in the macro economy and the financial market; and decided not to introduce any monetary action. The overall economic picture showed that growth in monetary aggregates slowed as the banking system's credit to government contracted; the foreign exchange market remained stable, with the official gross external reserves showing further improvement and the naira exchange rate appreciating. The level of the banks' interest rates, however, increased and the average inflation rate rose further. review of monetary developments showed that the broad money supply (M ) fell by 20 per cent to N2, 0234 billion at end-March 2004, in contrast to the 2 increase of 24 per cent recorded in the preceding month; and the 78 per cent increase in March a year earlier. The cumulative growth since the end of December 2003 showed that M grew by 193 per cent at end-March 2004, 2 significantly lower than the 160 per cent target for the entire fiscal 2004. The slow growth in broad money was attributed to the decline in the banking system credit (net) to the federal government. The banking system's credit to the private sector, on the other hand, rose by 137 per cent during the first quarter of 2004. The narrow money (M ) also fell by 23 per cent in March 2004, compared 1 with declines of 24 and 32 per cent recorded in February and January 2004, respectively. The cumulative growth since the end of December 2003 showed a decline of 162 percent at end-March 2004, which contrasted with the 134 per cent programmed target for the fiscal year. The main factor contracting the growth in narrow money supply was the substantial fall in the banking system's net claims on the Federal Government. In addition, the monetary operations of the CBN showed a net withdrawal of liquidity from the banking system in March 2004. The treasury bills issue rate declined; although available data indicated a general increase in the banks' deposit and lending rates as well as a rise in the inter-bank call rate, owing to the liquidity squeeze in the banking system. The pressure on the foreign exchange market moderated further in March, 2004, as sales in the Dutch Auction System (DAS) segment of the market declined to US $ 69016 million from US $ 78014 million in February 2004. Consequently the naira exchange rate appreciated to N13426 per US $100 in March 2004 from N13500 per US$100 in the preceding month. The naira, also appreciated in the Bureaux De Change (BDC), from N14295 to N13992 per US$100 in the same period. The stock of official external reserves of the country rose further from US$935 billion at end-February 2004 to US$968 billion at end-March 2004, which can finance more than 80 months of imports. The twelve-month moving average inflation rate rose further in February 2004. Available data from the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) showed that the 2 average inflation rate was 165 per cent in February 2004 up from 150 per cent in the preceding month. The annualised month-on-month inflation rate also increased from 224 per cent in January 2004 to 248 per cent in February 2004. The rise in the inflation rate was largely attributed to the increase in the prices of clothing materials, house rent, health services and items for personal care, as well as the rise in prices of vegetables and fruits. Encouraged by the continued moderation in the growth of broad money supply, coupled with the reduction in the pressure on the demand for foreign exchange, the Committee observed that the prospects of containing inflation and stabilising the interest rate were high, if the current level of fiscal prudence was sustained. Against these assumptions, the Committee decided not to introduce any monetary policy change. Meanwhile continued effort will be made to monitor the impact of the recent withdrawal of liquidity from the banks under the new settlement system with a view to fine-tuning the existing policies, if necessary.

Thailand,2004-04-21,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 21 April 2004 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. The MPC reviewed the latest data on economic conditions in Thailand and deemed that economic growth in the first two months of 2004 continued to be robust, supported by both domestic and external demand. Although news of the avian flu outbreak and unrest in southern Thailand led to some reductions in consumer and investor confidence, domestic spending remained strong with further increases in the private investment and private consumption indices. External stability remained strong with the current account continuing in surplus and international reserves at a high level. Internal stability remained satisfactory. Headline inflation edged up to 23 per cent year-on-year in March from 22 per cent in the previous month driven primarily by higher food and beverage prices. Core inflation remained unchanged from the 02 per cent year-on-year registered in February. The MPC assessed that the overall economic growth process continued to be sound, supported by robust domestic spending and continued recovery in the world economy. While upward pressure on core inflation became more apparent, it is expected to remain within the targeted range. Nevertheless the MPC stressed the need to monitor inflation trends in other countries, oil prices, and consumer goods prices closely since they have the potential to affect prices domestically. The MPC decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 125 per cent per annum."
South Africa,2004-04-22,"In the first two months of 2004 the rate of CPIX inflation has risen moderately but remains well within the target range of 3-6 per cent. This increase in the inflation rate was nevertheless slightly less than the forecast of the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank's projections for the inflation rate in the first two months of the year were higher than the actual figures. These results are therefore still within our projections indicating that the rate of inflation is likely to remain in the inflation target range over the next two years. The twelve-month rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost of mortgage bonds (the CPIX) rose from 4,0 per cent in December 2003 to 4,2 per cent in January and 4,8 per cent in February 2004. If energy and food prices are excluded, the year-on-year rate of increase in the prices of other goods and services included in the CPIX has fluctuated around a level of about 5,7 per cent over the four months up to February 2004. The higher level of CPIX inflation excluding energy and food prices was due to continued high increases in the prices of services. The twelve-month rate of increase in the prices of services included in the CPIX measured around 8 per cent during the first two months of 2004. In particular, high rates of increase were recorded in the rent of fixed property, medical costs and educational fees and the wages of domestic workers were adjusted upwards by the Minister of Labour's determination. The consumer prices of goods on a year-on-year basis rose from 2,0 per cent in December 2003 to 3,0 per cent in February 2004 largely due to increases in the running cost of motor vehicles. Measured from month to month and adjusted for seasonal factors. CPIX inflation rose from low rates of increase in the last three months of 2003, to levels of 1,0 per cent in January 2004 and 0,8 per cent in February. These monthly rates were the result of increases in the prices of petrol and diesel, food, alcoholic drinks and medical expenses. The prices of goods and services for most other categories continued to decline in the first two months of 2004. Despite these increases in the CPIX, the inflation outlook over the coming months as well as over the longer term continues to be favourable. Recent developments in the production price index, which affects the CPIX with a short lag, should continue to restrain consumer price inflation over the short term. From the second half of 2003, the all-goods production price index has generally declined from month to month. The seasonally adjusted percentage change over one month in the production price index in January 2004 was again negative, followed by an increase of 0,1 per cent in February. Measured over a period of twelve months, the all-goods production price index has declined in every month since September 2003, but the rate of decline has moderated somewhat from 2,5 per cent in November 2003 to 1,0 per cent in February 2004. This decline in production price inflation can mainly be ascribed to the recovery in the external value of the rand. The year-on-year change in the prices of imported goods became negative in April 2003, and in February 2004 this rate of decline amounted to 8,0 per cent. The decline in the prices of imported goods affected the inflation in domestically produced goods, which slowed down considerably during the course of 2003. The twelve-month rate of increase in the prices of domestically produced goods picked up somewhat from 0,2 per cent in November 2003 to 1,6 per cent in January 2004. These developments clearly indicate that production prices should exert hardly any pressure on consumer prices over the short term. The expected developments in the CPIX over the coming months will mainly be related to exogenous developments, such as changes in energy prices, indirect taxes and food. As the second-round effects of these increases are expected to be small and because a number of other factors are still favouring low increases in prices, the long-term inflation outlook is still promising. The expected acceleration in global economic growth noted in previous statements of the Monetary Policy Committee, has now been confirmed by recent international statistical releases. In the USA, the UK. Japan. China and other countries in Asia, economic growth was quite strong in the second half of 2003. A moderate economic recovery also became discernible in the production figures of the Euro area. The growth in the world economy has been accompanied by a steep increase in international commodity prices. Despite this rise in commodity prices, world inflation has remained at low levels and is expected to remain so for the rest of 2004. Some pressure has been exerted on domestic prices by the increase in oil prices in 2004 due to output restrictions by OPEC, political tensions in the Middle East and Venezuela, and concerns about oil stocks in the United States. Although this may give rise to short-term increases in consumer prices, oil prices should, however, not be a major threat to inflation over the long term because oil demand and supply are expected to be more or less in balance. Domestically, most conditions seem to endorse the containment of inflation within the target range. Domestic demand conditions are not at present a source of inflationary pressure, with the growth in real gross domestic product at an annualised rate of 1½ per cent in the fourth quarter of 2003 being well below the growth potential of the economy. This is confirmed by the ample spare capacity in manufacturing where the utilisation of production capacity amounted to 79,6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2003. It is particularly noteworthy that inflation expectations have continued to decline as evidenced in the latest Bureau for Economic Research (Stellenbosch University) inflation expectations survey, commissioned by the South African Reserve Bank, published today. The widespread rains in the first three months of 2004 have improved the agricultural outlook considerably. Most crop estimates have been revised upwards and shortages of agricultural produce should not have a serious impact on food prices. This is also reflected in the recent decline in the maize price. Over the short term, the improved weather conditions could lead to higher meat prices as farmers will now probably be inclined to build up their herds of livestock. Another important factor that should contribute to price stability is the continued fiscal discipline applied by government. The fiscal policy announced in the Budget for the fiscal year 2004/05 is being pursued in a prudent manner which should not place pressure on domestic prices. As with any prognosis about likely future developments, there are a number of uncertainties that could impact on this outlook and which the MPC will continue to monitor closely. Strong domestic demand has had a big impact on the volume of imports, which rose sharply in the second half of 2003. Over this same period exports did not perform well. Fortunately, these developments were offset to some extent by a substantial improvement in South Africa's terms of trade, reflecting the increases in international commodity prices. The deficit on the current account of the balance of payments nevertheless amounted to 1,8 per cent of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2003. Trade statistics for the first two months of 2004 indicate that the current account deficit probably increased further over these two months. The surplus on the trade account of the balance of payments declined from a seasonally adjusted annualised level of R14,3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2003 to R7,6 billion in the first two months of 2004. The deficits on the current account of the balance of payments have been comfortably financed by inflows of capital. Moreover the rand has demonstrated greater stability in recent months with the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand currently at around the same level that it was at in the latter part of 2003. It is impossible to predict what the external value of the rand will be over the coming months, but a widening in the deficit on current account does increase the risk of accelerating inflation. A further factor when considering the inflation outlook is the continued strong growth in nominal unit labour cost. Although the rate of increase in these costs has declined from 6 per cent in 2002 to 5 per cent in 2003, the salaries and wages per worker still increased at a rate of 8,6 per cent in 2003. The recent growth in money supply may also be an early indicator of potential inflationary pressures in the longer term. Measured over twelve months, growth in M3 remained around 12 per cent from September 2003 to January 2004 and then accelerated to just above 15 per cent in February. This latest month's increase in M3 was to a large extent due to a decline in government deposits reflecting the redemption and coupon interest payments on government bonds. The increase in money supply growth was not accompanied by an acceleration in bank credit extension to the private sector. The twelve-month growth rate in total loans and advances of banks to the private sector remained stable at levels of around 12,5 per cent in the first two months of 2004, i.e. at about the same rate as during the last half of 2003. The process of adjustment of global economic imbalances, and the risk of continuing geopolitical tensions, could be a source of increased international instability which could impede the present recovery in the world economy and pose threats to low inflation and growth in emerging market economies. In the short term, a particular concern in this context is the risk of pressure on domestic fuel costs arising from the prevailing higher oil prices. Taking these factors into consideration, the central expectation of the Monetary Policy Committee is that CPIX inflation will remain within the target range during the forecast period while the economy should pick up momentum. This momentum could be greatly assisted by appropriate sustainable supply side measures. Accordingly the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to maintain the current monetary policy stance and keep the repo rate unchanged at 8,0 per cent per annum. The Monetary Policy Committee will continue to monitor all the factors affecting the inflation outlook. If the outlook changes, the Committee will not hesitate to change the monetary policy stance."
Israel,2004-04-25,"The Bank of Israel'sMonetary Program for May 2004. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for May 2004, according to which the interest rate will be unchanged at 4.1 percent, following its 5- percentage-point cumulative reduction that started at the endof 2002. This pause in the process of lowering the interest rate, against the background of a certain rise in inflation expectations for one year forward and in private forecasters' assessments, results from the development of certain parameters since the beginning of the year that create upward pressure on prices. First, the NIS has depreciated by a cumulative 4 percent against the dollar since the beginning of the year, and by 2.5 percent against the currency basket. Second, the rise in the money supply has accelerated, with a rise of 8 percent in the first four months of 2004 compared with a rise in the last twelve months of 14 percent. Third, the rise in the money supply should be viewed against the background of the fact that since the beginning of the year the downward trend inyields on one-year Treasury bills and on government bonds has halted, and even reversed, and these have risen by 0.7 percentage points despite thereduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate. Fourth, since the middle of 2003 the nominal and real wage per employee post have risen by more in the public sector than in the private sector, in contrast to their downward trend in 2002 and the first half of 2003. Fifth, estimates of business-sector growth have been revised upwards, and now stand at 5 percent for 2004, compared with the modest rise of less than 2 percent in 2003. Since the beginning of the year the differential between the yield on government bonds and the Bank of Israel interest rate has expanded markedly, which is inconsistent in the long run with price stability. Thus the differential between the yield on unindexed 10-year Shahar bonds and the Bank of Israel interest rate reached 3.3 percentage points in April 2004, up from only 2.0 percentage points in January 2004. This took place against the background of the rise in the yield on Shahar bonds from 7.0 percent in January 2004 to 7.6 percent in April 2004, a period whenthe Bank of Israel's interest rate was declining. The differential between the yield on CPI-indexed ten-year Galil government bonds and the Bank of Israel real interest rate also rose to 1.4 percentage points in April 2004 from 0.2 percentage points in January 2004. This differential too widened due to the rise of the real yield on the Galil bonds, on the one hand, and the fallin the Bank of Israel implicit real interest to 2.9 percent, on the other (see Table A below) Thepossibility of renewing the process of reducing the interest rate in the next few months will be affected by the following developments, andwill depend on the inflation path remaining consistent with the price-stability target and on calm in the financial markets: C 2A 6 A rise in capital inflow into the economy larger than capital outflow, which could occur with the increase in business-sector activity, is likely to cause the strengthening of the NIS, and reduce pressures for price rises; C 2A 6 A fiscal policy that focuses on reducing the high debt burden, 105 percent of GDP in 2003, is likely to cause the renewal of thedownward trend in yields on the domestic market, in contrast to the trend in the first four months of 2004, and this will probably enable the short-term interest rate to be reduced. The Bank of Israel will continue the review its interest-rate policy month by month in the light of the above and other relevant developments,and will continue to strive towards the maintenance of price stability within the framework of the government's inflation target. In so doing it will contribute to the creation ofthe conditions required to support the turnaround in economic activity and the achievement of sustainable growth. The Bank of Israel\'s interest rate continues to be lower than that of the central banks of some advanced economies (Australia and New Zealand), and similar to that of the Bank of England and to the average interest rate of the advanced and emerging countries.

Thepossibility of renewing the process of reducing the interest rate in the next few months will be affected by the following developments, andwill depend on the inflation path remaining consistent with the price-stability target and on calm in the financial markets:. A rise in capital inflow into the economy larger than capital outflow, which could occur with the increase in business-sector activity, is likely to cause the strengthening of the NIS, and reduce pressures for price rises;. A fiscal policy that focuses on reducing the high debt burden, 105 percent of GDP in 2003, is likely to cause the renewal of thedownward trend in yields on the domestic market, in contrast to the trend in the first four months of 2004, and this will probably enable the short-term interest rate to be reduced.

C 2A 6 A fiscal policy that focuses on reducing the high debt burden, 105 percent of GDP in 2003, is likely to cause the renewal of thedownward trend in yields on the domestic market, in contrast to the trend in the first four months of 2004, and this will probably enable the short-term interest rate to be reduced.

Poland,2004-04-27,"Warsaw, 27 April 2004 INFORMATION FROM A MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 26-27 April 2004 On 26-27 April 2004 the Monetary Policy Council held a meeting. The Council read materials prepared by the Management Board and the NBP Departments, as well as information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council discussed the external environment of the Polish economy as well as real trends, trends in payments and social welfare benefits, trends in the public finance sector, trends in the money supply, loans and interest rates, and the formation of pricing and inflationary expectations as well as inflationary prospects. An analysis of the economic situation indicates that in last period there was a significant increase in inflationary expectations. This is a result of supply shocks, increased demand pressure and changes to the price structure caused by Poland's EU entry. Although some of these factors have a transitory character, the observed economic revival, which in itself is an inflationary risk factor, gives rise to fears that these expectations may become persistent and as a result there may be a risk of exceeding the upper limit of the inflationary target. Taking these factors under consideration the Council decided to change its monetary policy approach to restrictive and decided not to change the level of interest rates, maintaining the reference rate at 5.25%, the lombard rate at 6.75% and the NBP deposit rate at 3.75%. In March 2004 the annual CPI indicator was 1.7%, as in January 2004. The annual base inflation indicator was from 1.1% to 1.7% I Factors favoring low inflation: continued moderate money supply level; annual rate of growth of the M3 aggregate increased by 5.7% in March 2004 against 4.9% in February 2004, continued low growth rate in corporate loans; its annual growth rate in March 2004 was at -0.4% against 2.3% in February 2004. The annual loan growth rate for households was at 13% against 14.2% in February of this year accelerated growth of labour efficiency in the corporate sector; it increased in industry as a whole by 24.5% on an annual basis (19.4% in February of this year), while in the processing industry by 28.0% (in February of this year by 23.7%). At the same time, an analysis of employment on the basis of the Study on the Economic Activity of the Population may signal that the actual rate of growth of employment in the corporate sector is probably higher than its rate of growth calculated on the basis of data from corporate statistics. This may indicate that there is an actually lower increase in labour efficiency. II. Factors giving rise to an increase in inflation risk: consecutive month of an observed growth in inflationary expectations. Individual inflation rate expectations on a 12-month basis increased from 1.6% in December 2003 to 2,5% in April of this year. The inflation forecast of bank analysts on an 11-month basis increased from 2.5% to 2.9% respectively. At the same time there was a strong increase in the general condition indicator, illustrating price expectations in retail trade, which had the highest value since November 1999. The Polish economy is currently in a revival phase, stimulated by rapidly increasing export. There are indications of renewed investment activity. The fastest since January 2001 increase in the salaries fund may be larger than that of last year. NBP estimates that the GNP rate of increase in the first quarter will be 6.4% while the GNP for the entire 2004 should be above 5%, which indicates a faster than expected closing of the demand gap, according to an April GUS study, the general condition of the processing industry was the highest for the entire period studied, i.e. from 1992. There was a less pessimistic assessment of the condition in construction and trade than in the previous month, increase in construction-assembly production, significant improvement of corporate financial results, increase of investments in the processing industry and observed significant increase in the sale construction materials indicates the possibility of increasing investment expenditures in the economy. Furthermore. NBP studies regarding the general condition of enterprises indicates an increase in the percentage of enterprises declaring a start of new investments. This indicator had the highest value since 1999. amongst the supply shocks influencing an increase in inflation growth the price of foodstuffs in 2004 carries with it the greatest risk and it may be greater than that indicated in actually available forecasts. This indicates, amongst others, as signaled in the GUS study of the general condition, foodstuff price increases in April of this year and expectations of further, significant increase of those prices in the next few months, as formulated by food selling businesses. In the first half of April food prices increased by 2.3% in comparison with the first half of March of this year, i.e. significantly stronger than expected, growth in the PPI indicator which increased in March 2004 by 1.3% and was 4.6% on an annual basis, which is the highest growth rate since January 2001. The increase of this indicator was foremost a result of an increase in obtained export prices. Nevertheless, the NBP estimates indicate also a significant increase in prices obtained by producers on the domestic market, increase in the forecast oil prices. Current forecast of the average annual price of oil in 2004 was increased by 0.7 USD/b in comparison with that forecast in March 2004. From September 2003 to April 2004 the forecast oil prices increased from 26.0 USD/b to 31.4 USD/b, high budget deficit, increasing governmental loan requirements, and political instability are the source of continued uncertainty on financial markets leading to an increase in the yield of treasury securities and the weakening of the zloty exchange rate. In the last 12 months there has been a clear weakening of the zloty; it weakened against the euro by 11% and 3.5% against the USD that in conditions of a closing demand gap may lead to inflationary pressure, increasing political instability that may reduces the likelihood of passage of laws necessary for the recovery of public finances. According to current NBP estimates, it is very likely that the second prudential threshold, i.e. 55% of the GDP, will be exceeded already in 2004. The next meeting of the Council will take place 18 May 2004. External factors Data indicating a strong increase in new places of work in the US economy in March of Improvement this year had a positive effect on market climate. There was an improvement in the indicators of confidence reflecting both business confidence and American consumer confidence. March of this year in the US also noted a significant increase in the rate of retail growth. economy, lack There was no improvement, however, in the main indicators of economic confidence in the of euro area. Data regarding retail trade activity and household confidence confirm the improvement continuance already for two years of a weak consumer demand in this region. There are in the euro especially unfavorable indicators of the current condition in Germany. March saw a worsening area of expectations amongst German consumers, the IFO Institute indicator was lowered and there was a continued negative rate of growth in retail sales. In light of increasing signs of economic upturn in the US economy there has been an increase in market expectation of a rates hike by the FRB  currently most analysts expect such a decision in the third quarter of this year. In March 2004 the average price of Brent oil was 33.8 USD/b and was the highest since October 1990. Contrary market expectations and despite continuance of high oil prices. High oil prices OPEC confirmed its decision to lower its extraction limits by 1 million barrels beginning from on world April of this year. At the same time, as a result of political risk the markets are fearful of markets continued supply of oil from Iraq. Also, information on a decrease in oil supplies in the US contributed to an increase in oil prices. In April of this year the Department of State for Energy increased its forecast of oil prices for 2004 to 31.4 USD/b (an increase of 0.7 USD/b in comparison with the forecast for March 2004). Economic situation in Poland In February 2004 there was a further decrease in the current account deficit. In comparison Improvement with February of last year it decreased by EUR 520 million and amounted to EUR 210 in current million. The decrease in the negative current account balance was foremost an influence of account the positive balance of services (as a result of a high increase in their export which on the basis balance 1 of transactions was the highest balance noted) and a deficit decrease in the turnover of goods. balance Also, the positive transfer balance was higher than in comparison with the previous year. However, a deepening current account deficit was influenced by an increased earnings deficit. The negative balance in the turnover of goods decreased in February 2004 by EUR 230 million which was a result of a continuation of a higher export growth rate (13.4% in comparison with February 2003) than for import (increase of 6.5%). From the beginning of this year current account deficit has already decreased by EUR 1.1 billion. In the course of the first two months of this year all the positions positively influenced the improvement in current account balance with the strongest deficit decrease in the turnover of goods and a surplus increase in the exchange of services. In the period January  February 2004 the export value increased by 8.6%. Equally the rate of export growth as well as that of import was more than twice higher in comparison with the first two months of 2003 (then the export value increased by 7.2% and that of import by 3.3%). Industrial production increased in March 2004 by 23.8% in comparison with March 2003. The high growth trend in industrial production on the whole continued to be a result of very Industrial strong sales in the processing industry whose volume exceeded the level of last year by 27.9%. production A strong increase in the production growth rate resulted partly from differences in number of growth in working days  March had 23 working days in comparison with 21 days in the previous March, higher month. After eliminating the influence of seasonal factors the increase in production on the than expected whole was 18.3% while in the processing industry 21.6%. For the first time since June 2000 (with the exception of a single increase in July 2003) a production increase of 6.3% on an annual basis in construction-assembly was noted in March of this year. In the 1st quarter of 2004 construction-assembly production was lower by 4.3% than in the previous year. According to GUS data, the average salaries growth in the enterprise sector in March of this year in comparison with February of this year was nominally 2.1% (1.8% in real terms). In comparison with March 2003 this increase was nominally 7% (4.9% in real terms). On an increasing balance in the period January  March 2004 the average salary in the enterprise sector increased nominally by 5.5% (3.5% in real terms) while in the analogous period of 2003 this increase was 1.9% (1.4%) respectively. At the same time there has been an accelerated increase in labour efficiency; increase of 2 24.5% (19.4% in February of this year) on an annual basis in industry as a whole, while in the processing industry by 28.0% (23.7% in February of this year). According to GUS data from enterprise reporting the number of those employed in 2003 dropped by 2.7%. However, an analysis of the data from the Study on the Economic Activity of the Population indicates that the number of those employed in the economy (taking into account those enterprises employing from 1 to 9 workers) may have increased in 2003. An Salaries increase in employment may have concerned the more flexible forms of employment that are growth in not reflected in data reported to GUS by enterprises. Also, estimates of the increase in labour enterprise efficiency on the basis of enterprise statistics may be higher than the actual increase in labour sector efficiency. Condition of public finance sector In the 1st quarter of 2004 the combined state budget revenue was higher compared to the analogical period last year (7.8%) which is a good result in face of its forecast annual increase (1.2%). The degree of annual revenue plan realization was also higher than last year's level (23.3% as against 21.4% in the previous year). The high increase in indirect taxes (9.5% year on year), especially VAT, had the greatest influence by far on the formation of the state budget revenue in the period from the 1st to 3nd quarters of this year. Especially strong influence from this title in February and March of this year demonstrate an increase in retail sales stemming probably from increasing domestic demand and an increase in imports in connection with tax changes from May 1 of this year. There were also higher inflows from the CIT tax (28.7% year on year) that is probably a result of the corporate financial situation. The state budget expenditures after March of this year were nominally lower by 2.1% than the expenditures last year. This was connected with a lack of need of subsidy for the FP (Labour Fund) from the beginning of this year, lower costs for servicing the public debt and a Lower than in slower realization of subvention for FUS (Social Security Fund) in February of this year. As a 2003 advance result, the degree of realization of the annual revenue plan of budgetary expenditures reached in 23.9% which means significantly less than in the previous years. expenditures As a result of a favorable earnings situation and limitation of budgetary expenditures, the and state 3 state budget deficit was after March of this year at a level of PLN 11.8 billion (26.1% of that and state planned), hence significantly lower than in the same period last year. (39.8%). budget deficit Despite the good results of the state budget after March of this year, the key period for after three realizing the state financial plan will be the months of May to July of this year due to the months of expected loss of earnings and increase in expenditures connected with the introduction from 2004 May 1 of settlements with the EU budget. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate According to figures presented in forward information, in March 2004 the M3 money supply increased by PLN 2.1 billion (0.6%) in comparison with February of this year. The significant weakening of the zloty had a great influence on the money supply in March of this year. After eliminating the influence of fluctuating exchange rates, the monthly growth rate of M3 aggregate amounted to PLN 2.9 billion (0.9%). The annual growth rate of the M3 aggregate was 5.7% A change in the M3 supply stemmed to a great extent from an increase corporate deposits. In March 2004 they increased by PLN 3.3 billion (5.2%). There was foremost an increase in zloty deposit categories while there was an increase in solely means that were deposited on current accounts. The annual rate of growth in this category continues from September of last year at a level of above 20%, amounting in March of this year to 28.5%. In March of this year household deposits, after one month's period of increase in the previous month, decreased by PLN 2.1 billion (1.1%). After removing the influence of exchange rate fluctuations their decrease amounted to PLN 1.5 billion (0.8%). In March 2004 there was a collapse in the increasing annual growth trend of household deposits which decreased from 1.3% in February of this year to  2.1% in March of this year. One of the main factors influencing an outflow in household deposits was a renewed interest in investment fund deposits. A positive balance in payments, unit redemptions and investment certificates amounted to about PLN 0.5 billion and was the highest since August 2003. The state of cash in circulation outside of bank tills in creased in March of this year by PLN 0.3 billion (0.6%). The annual rate of growth of cash in circulation amounted to 13% (16.0% in February of this year). 4 Household loans increased nominally by PLN 0.8 billion (0.7%). After taking account of the influence of exchange rate fluctuations this increase amounted to PLN 1.5 billion (1.4%). The annual growth rate amounted to 13.0% (14.2% in February) that is connected with a Low growth strong zloty depreciation in the previous year. A decrease in corporate loans in March of this rate for year by PLN 0.9 billion (0.7%) stemmed entirely from the zloty appreciation. After corporate eliminating the influence of exchange rate fluctuations, the level of corporate indebtedness in loans the banking sector did not register a change. For the first time since May 2002 the annual growth rate in corporate indebtedness reached a negative value which was  0.4% which as in the case of household deposits was connected with the significant zloty depreciation last year In the period of 18 March to 22 April 2004 the zloty weakened against the euro by 0.6% and 3.5% against the dollar (from the beginning of the year the EUR/PLN and USD/PLN Zloty exchange rates rose by 1.1% and 7% respectively). In the last twelve months the zloty depreciation weakened against the euro by 11% and 3.5% against the dollar. in April Uncertainties resulting from political risk and existing threat to the continuation of indispensable public finances reforms had a strong effect on the money market situation which contributed to a depreciation trend for the zloty in April of this year, despite an improvement in the external equilibrium (deficit on the current account) and inflow of portfolio capital on the bonds and shares markets. Fluctuation in benchmark bond prices increased from the last meeting of the MPC. The yield on 2-year, 5-year and 10-year bonds increased in this period by 51, 52 and 44 b.p. respectively (from the beginning of the year this change was 80, 52 and 54 b.p. respectively). In addition to the exchange rate, factors that decisively influence this tendency were both of a global and domestic character. In the 1st quarter of April the yield on Polish bonds followed bond yields on international markets. In the second half of the month the drop in bond prices was a result of the publication of better than expected industrial production data. This increased expectations of a rates hike. The continuance of a difference in the yield of 5 and 10-year bonds at a high level in respect to an analogical euro bond area demonstrates that investment on the Polish market is considered to be very risky. 5 Prices, inflationary expectations In March 2004 the annual CPI was 1.7% (1.6% in February). In comparison with March 2003, the highest increase in prices was in foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages (3.3%), prices for apartment usage and power carriers (2.9%) prices in alcohol and tobacco products (2.3%). Prices of clothing and footwear, however, were lower than in March 2003 After a higher than expected increase in the price of foodstuffs in the first half of April one can forecast that the inflation will increase in April of this year to a level of 2,2% on an annual basis. The net inflation in March 2004 on an annual basis amounted to 1.1%, as in February of this year. There was an increase of 4.6% in the PPI in March of this year in comparison with the analogical period in 2003 (4.2% in February). The annual growth rate of the PPI continued at its highest level since January. The indicator of prices of industrial production sold in March of this year is a result of the continuation of a growth trend in the mining and excavation sector, especially in iron ore excavation which is connected with price increases of copper on world markets. The average price of a ton of copper on the London exchange in March of this year was once again the highest since November 1995  USD 3009/t (an increase of 10% in one month and above 81% in comparison with March 2003). There has been an increase in the inflation expectations of individuals. The inflation rate expectations of individuals in April of this year, within the next 12 months, amounts to 2.5% Increase in (by 0.1 point percentage more than in the previous month). Bank analysts forecast that in inflation December 2004 the inflation rate will be 2.6% (a drop of 0.1 point percentage), in March 2005 expectations at 2.9% (increase of 0.1 point percentage), while the average annual rate of inflation in 2005 at 2.8% (no change)."
United States,2004-05-04,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent. The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid rate and hiring appears to have picked up. Although incoming inflation data have moved somewhat higher, long-term inflation expectations appear to have remained well contained. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. Similarly, the risks to the goal of price stability have moved into balance. At this juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy actions were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Thomas M Hoenig; Donald L Kohn; Cathy E Minehan; Mark W Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole."
Philippines,2004-05-05,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to leave the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The BSP's policy rates have been kept unchanged over the past ten months; the last policy rate reduction of 25 basis points was done on 2 July 2003. Based on the latest assessment by the Monetary Board of prevailing macroeconomic and financial conditions, the outlook remains that of a continued manageable environment for inflation over the policy horizon. Cost-side factors—notably transport fares, utility charges and fuel costs—remain the principal source of risks to future inflation. Inflationary pressures resulting from such factors are largely outside the influence of monetary policy, and therefore do not require action from monetary authorities. In addition, the continued evidence of double-digit unemployment, spare capacity in manufacturing and sluggish bank lending over the past several quarters indicate that significant demand-driven pressures on consumer prices are not likely to materialize in the near term. Nevertheless, monetary authorities continue to face inflation risks from sentiment-driven volatile movements in the nominal exchange rate, as a result of political uncertainty and investors' concern about the attainability of fiscal consolidation over the medium term. After discussing these considerations, the Monetary Board agreed that the balance of demand- and supply-side risks to inflation continues to point to a manageable environment for inflation over the next year or so. After due consideration of prevailing inflationary risks, the Monetary Board expects average inflation for 2004 and 2005 to lie within the Government's inflation target of 4.0-5.0 percent. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor closely all developments that may affect the outlook for inflation and inflation expectations over the policy horizon."
Euroarea,2004-05-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to welcome you to our press conference here in Helsinki, where the Governing Council of the European Central Bank met today for the ninth time outside Frankfurt. I would like to thank acting Governor Matti Louekoski for his invitation and very kind hospitality, as well as the staff of Suomen Pankki  Finlands Bank for a perfectly organised meeting. We deeply regret that Mr Matti Vanhala had to resign from his position and we wish him all the best. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we continue to expect that price stability will be maintained over the medium term. Accordingly, we did not change our assessment of the monetary policy stance and left the key ECB interest rates at their current low levels. The low interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum are also supporting the economic recovery in the euro area. As always, we will continue to monitor carefully all developments that could affect our assessment of risks to price stability over the medium term. Allow me to elaborate on our decision, turning first to the economic analysis. Regarding the current situation and the very short-term outlook, the conjunctural indicators available still provide mixed evidence. All in all, they suggest that the recovery of real economic activity in the euro area has continued into 2004, albeit at a modest pace. Most recent information has been more encouraging, with the latest euro area survey data offering more positive signals with regard to the beginning of the second quarter. While the latest positive signals need to be confirmed by future developments, they underpin the expectation of the gradual recovery in the euro area continuing and strengthening over time. First, global economic growth continues to be robust and world trade has strengthened. The global economic upturn is broadly based, both geographically and across sectors, and thus provides a favourable external environment for the euro area. In this context, we expect euro area exports to grow significantly this year and next. Second, favourable financing conditions, improvements in corporate efficiency and earnings and the strength of global demand should help investment. Growth in real disposable income should support private consumption, especially since households appear not to face financial constraints that might impede stronger spending. Over time, consumer spending should also be supported by an improvement in labour market conditions. These considerations underpin our confidence in a continuation of the economic recovery, an expectation which is mirrored by available forecasts and projections. It is also in line with financial market developments over the past few weeks. Obviously, any forward-looking assessment is subject to risks and uncertainties. On the external side, the adverse terms-of-trade effects of recent rises in oil and other commodity prices pose risks at shorter horizons, while the persistence of global imbalances implies some uncertainties over the medium term. On the domestic side, uncertainties surrounding fiscal policy and structural reforms in some euro area countries seem to have contributed to preventing a more vigorous improvement in consumer confidence. A continued commitment to and greater clarity about the content and timing of these crucial reforms, supported by a better understanding of their necessity and benefits for all citizens, would help to resolve this uncertainty and thereby mitigate the associated risks for the euro area economy. Turning to price developments, annual HICP inflation rates will exhibit some short-term volatility over the coming months, as we already indicated on the occasion of previous meetings of the Governing Council. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.0% in April, after 1.7% in March. While no detailed information is available as yet, the recent rise in annual inflation rates is likely to mainly reflect a strong base effect in the energy component resulting from the marked decline of oil prices a year ago. Moreover, recent oil price increases have exerted additional upward pressure. As these factors will also play a role in the next few months, inflation rates of 2% or somewhat above are possible over the short term. Despite these recent, less positive developments, over longer horizons we expect inflation rates to remain in line with price stability. The latest data on wage growth in the fourth quarter of 2003 lend support to this view. Our outlook for price developments is in line with available forecasts and projections. However, at the current juncture, the increase in commodity prices in general, and oil prices in particular, may pose an upside risk to price stability. It will therefore remain important to pay close attention to inflation expectations. Moving on to the monetary analysis, annual M3 growth has moderated only slowly since the summer of 2003. While there is evidence of continued portfolio shifts out of M3 into longer-term assets, the pace of this adjustment remains modest. Both monetary and credit growth continue to be supported by the historically low level of interest rates in the euro area and may also reflect the improvement in the economic environment over the last few quarters. Given the continued strength of monetary growth, liquidity conditions remain ample in the euro area. The impact of this high level of liquidity on inflation over the medium term will depend on future developments in the economy and financial markets. Should excess liquidity persist, it could lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that the main scenario for the outlook for price developments over the medium term is in line with price stability. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis does not alter this view at the current juncture. As usual. I also wish to make a few remarks regarding other policies in the euro area. With regard to fiscal policies, the Governing Council sees increased reasons for concern. On the basis of the latest Commission forecasts, the average euro area budgetary position is not expected to improve much this year or next. A growing number of countries are likely to report significant imbalances, while fiscal consolidation efforts might fall short of commitments. It is essential that all countries concerned undertake credible measures to address these concerns. Such measures should be part of a comprehensive reform strategy. This would underpin the ongoing economic upswing by boosting confidence in sound public finances and by improving the prospects for future economic growth. The Governing Council welcomes the decision by the Commission to request more consolidation efforts from a number of countries. Turning to structural reforms, the Governing Council reaffirms its view that such reforms are essential if the euro area's growth potential is to expand substantially. In particular, both our employment rate and our labour productivity growth need to increase significantly. Following our discussions here in Finland, let me stress that this requires a strengthened technological and scientific base and its application in the euro area as a whole, fostered by major efforts to enhance the human capital of our economy. In this context, we are particularly concerned that youth unemployment remains high in several countries. In order to achieve these goals, it is necessary to strengthen the implementation of structural reforms, both at the European and the national level. The Lisbon agenda provides an excellent diagnosis of the problem and we have a good understanding of the measures needed to deal with it. We strongly support the ongoing reforms, which should be speeded up across the euro area. It is important to understand that everyone will be better off  with higher growth and more jobs  if and when the reforms of the Lisbon agenda are delivered."
South Korea,2004-05-06,"Despite the delay in the recovery of private consumption and facilities investment, industrial production is sustaining its brisk pace, driven by the rapid expansion of exports. The real economy as a whole continues on a path of steady improvement. Core inflation has remained stable owing to subdued domestic demand. Consumer price inflation, though, is rising comparatively rapidly, largely in response to the run-up in international oil prices. Owing to the widened surplus on the goods account, the current account is still running a surplus. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions have been favorable due to the persistently low demand for funds and concerns over credit card companies have lessened gradually. On the other hand, there are signs that sensitivity to the credit risks associated with small- and medium-sized enterprises may be on the rise. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.75 percent) for the intermeeting period."
Czech Republic,2004-05-11,"Press Conference of the CNB Bank Board 3rd Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments May 7, 2009 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided by a majority vote to decrease the CNB two-week repo rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.50 %, effective 11 May 2004. At the same time it decided to decrease the discount rate and Lombard rate by the same amount, to 0.50 % and 2.50 % respectively. Five members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for leaving interest rates unchanged. Message ooff tthhee ffoorreeccaasstt Headline (and monetary-policy relevant) inflation will continue declining this year but will remain in positive figures. Next year inflation will again start rising and will approach the 2% inflation target at the end of 2010. The domestic economic activity will decline this year by 2,4% but the economy will return to modest growth in 2010. The nominal exchange rate will initially correct its losses from beginning of the year and afterwards will be broadly flat. Consistent with the forecast is a decline in market interest rates this year followed by a modest rise in 2010.

Chile,2004-05-13,"The Central Bank of Chile Press Release* Santiago, 13 May 2004 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 1.75% (annual). The external scenario relevant for Chile continues to be very positive, despite increased volatility in financial markets and the rise in the international oil price. Also, recent output and spending figures confirm the gradual growth acceleration projected for this year. CPI annual inflation is expected to progressively approach 3% during the usual 24-month policy horizon. This, notwithstanding that in the near future monthly inflation may show large swings because of more volatility in fuel prices and the exchange rate. The Central Bank of Chile reiterates that it will continue to conduct monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to address any projected inflation deviations in either direction from the specified target inflation rate. In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
Nigeria,2004-05-20,"PRESS RELEASE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 35 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE IN MAY, 2004 In keeping with the Bank's policy of transparency in the conduct of monetary and financial policies, the Central Bank of Nigeria hereby publishes the summary of the deliberations and decisions of its Monetary Policy Committee meeting, held in May, 2004. The Committee met once to review developments in the macroeconomy and financial markets. In April, 2004, the overall performance of the economy was mixed. Although the growth in money supply (M ) was broadly on target, the rate of 2 inflation continued to accelerate. The pressure on the naira, however, moderated, as the level of gross official external reserves rose. Moreover the money market remained relatively calm, with both deposit and lending rates rising only moderately. The report from the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) indicated that in March, 2004, the inflation rate, on moving average basis, rose to 178 per cent from 165 per cent, in the preceding month. The annualized month-on- month inflation rate was 225 per cent, down from 248 per cent in the preceding month. The continued rise in the inflation rate was traced to developments in the non-food index, largely reflecting the lag-effect of the deregulation of the down-stream petroleum sector on production cost, as well as the import prohibition, among other causes. 4. The rapid growth in the monetary aggregates, which commenced in February, 2004, moderated slightly in April. In the month under review, the broad money stock (M ) increased by 12 per cent, compared with the 17 per 2 cent growth recorded in the preceding month. The cumulative growth of broad money over the end-December, 2003 level was 70 per cent. Narrow money (M ) and base money rose only marginally by 01 and 06 per cent, 1 respectively. The main expansionary factor of money supply was the rise in the foreign assets (net) of the banking system, which was moderated by the substantial fall in bank credit to the domestic economy, especially to government. Available data on money market developments indicated a general increase in bank deposit and lending rates. In the month under review, the average inter-bank call rate rose by 107 percentage points to 1589 per cent, over the level in March, 2004. Also the spread between average savings deposit and maximum lending rates widened only marginally from 1542 to 1545 per cent. In April, 2004, the demand for foreign exchange was moderately higher than in the preceding month, with the daily average sales rising to US$3454 million from US$3100 million in March, 2004. Arising from the increased foreign exchange inflow, the naira appreciated in all segments of the foreign exchange market. At the Dutch Auction System segment, it appreciated to N1334714 from N1344200 per US$100, while in the Bureaux de Change, 2 the naira strengthened from N1397604 to N1388523 per US$100. The level of official external reserves rose further to US$1088 billion, up from US$1049 billion at end-March, 2004. The Committee viewed with serious concern, the escalation in the rate of inflation and decided to embark on partial withdrawal of public sector funds with the deposit money banks, as a strategy for mopping up excess liquidity in the system. The Committee noted that developments in the macroeconomy will continue to be monitored, with a view to taking further policy action, if the need arises. James KA. Olekah Secretary.

Israel,2004-05-24,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program forJune 2004. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for June 2004, according to which the interest rate will be unchanged at 4.1 percent. From the end of 2002 to April 2004 the interest rate was cut by a cumulative 5 percentage points, and this is the second consecutive month in which the rate is beingkept unchanged. Therelatively steep rise in prices reflected by the latest published CPI and that expected for the current month, based on forecasts of various experts, drive home the point that despite price stability in Israel since 1999, the monthly volatility of the CPI is much higher than in other countries that enjoy price stability. This situation, against the background of the relatively rapid recovery of economic activity, introduces an element of uncertainty about the path of inflation in the future, and makesthe closest monitoring essential to ensure that it remains consistent with the long-term price-stability range of 1-3 percent a year. The decision not to change the interest rate for June means the continued reduction in short-term real interest to a new low of about 2.4 percent, because of the rise in inflation expectations. This policy is aimed at supporting continued economic recovery, as long as the Bank of Israel assesses that this does not conflict with price stability, which is one of the conditions necessary for the creation of sustained growth. Three important developments played a part in the Bank's decision not to changethe interest rate. First, assessments of inflation for one year forward derived from the capital market and from private forecasters' forecasts remain consistent with the target range of price stability. Second, fiscal policy continues to observe fiscal discipline that increases the likelihood that the government will adhere to the 2003 deficit target of 4 percent of GDP, and that conditions will be created that will enable the government to cut the deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2005 in accordance with its decision. These are the conditions necessary both to halt the upward trend of yields on government bonds that started at the beginning of the year and to boost investment in the economy. Third, the foreign-currency market continues to feature regular activity by buyers and sellers.On one side there is long-term capital inflow, deriving from economic growth, and on the other, an outflow of short-term capital resulting from acontraction of interest-rate differentials. These capital flows led to some excess demand for foreign currency that has weakened the NIS since the beginning of the year by about 5 percent against the dollar and by 4 percent against the currency basket. Ongoing economic recovery, particularly if based on the high-tech industries, will probably lead to increased long-term capital inflow during the year. The Bank of Israel 's interest rate is still lower than that of the central banks of someadvanced economies (the UK. Australia and New Zealand) and similar to the average rate of the central banks of the advanced and emerging countries. Table 1: Interest Rates in Israel and the US. Central banks' interest rates.

Malaysia,2004-05-26,"The Malaysian economy expanded by 7.6% in the first quarter of 2004. The robust economic growth was supported by stronger expansion in private sector demand, both consumption and investment demand, and more buoyant export growth arising from sustained expansion in global economic activity. Going forward, the economic outlook for Malaysia remains favourable. The sustained expansion in domestic aggregate demand is expected to continue to be reinforced by strong performance of the export sector. On the domestic front, rising consumer and investor confidence and improving earnings of both household and corporate sectors suggest that the upturn in private sector demand would be maintained. Inflation continues to remain low. The inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, rose by 1% in the first four months of 2004. Domestic price pressures are expected to remain subdued, with the recovery in private investment activity seen mainly in capacity expansion in sectors experiencing strong growth. Importantly, higher productivity is supporting real wage growth. Competition is also moderating price pressures. The underlying fundamentals will continue to accord flexibility for monetary policy to support stronger economic activities, without creating inflationary pressures. Interest rates can remain low for some time to come to support the growth momentum. The overnight policy rate (OPR) will therefore remain unchanged at 2.70%. Bank Negara Malaysia 26 May 2004."
Poland,2004-05-26,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 26 May 2004 INFORMATION FROM A MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL H e l d o n 2 5 - 2 6 M a y 2 0 0 4 On 25-26 May 2004 the Monetary Policy Council held a meeting. The Council read materials prepared by the Management Board and the NBP Departments, as well as information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council discussed the external environment of the Polish economy as well as real trends, trends in payments and social welfare benefits, trends in the public finance sector, trends in the money supply, loans and interest rates, and the formation of pricing and inflationary expectations as well as inflationary prospects. Increasing since the beginning of the year inflation expectations of households, stabilised in May at a higher level. Some measurements of inflation expectations once again increased in May while expectations of price increases in retail trade achieved the highest level since 1997. In April there was a significant growth in the PPI indicator while some producers are planning further significant price increases in the nearest months. There were increases, though in various degrees, of all measurements of the base inflation rate. These factors combined with a decisive increase in economic activity, whose scale surpasses expectations, indicate a high likelihood of further increase in inflation. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (22) 826 99 55, fax (22) 826 37 51. However, prepared analyses indicate that some of the indicators influencing an increase in inflationary expectations may be connected with Poland's European Union accession and probably have a temporary character. It may be assumed that data soon to become available will allow to better assess the force of influence of the transitory effects. Taking this into account, the Council resolved: To leave the monetary parameters unchanged and maintain its restrictive approach to monetary policy. In April 2004, the annual CPI was 2.2%. The base inflation indicator on an annual basis were from 1.2% to 2.3%. I. Factors favoring a low inflation rate: continued low growth rate in corporate loans; its annual growth rate was at 0.8% in April against 0.4% in March 2004. However, a significant increase in financial resources of the corporate sector may limit its demand for credit; continued high growth rate of labour efficiency; it increased in industry as a whole by 22.4% on an annual basis in April 2004 (by 24.5% in March 2004) while in the processing industry by 25.1% (by 28.0% in March 2004) continued high unemployment, which could, to a certain degree, limit pressure on salary increases. II. Factors giving rise to the risk of inflation growth: -2 - growth in inflationary expectations observed from the beginning of the year stabilised in May 2004 on a higher level. The inflation rate expectations of individuals within the next 12 months, rose from 1.6% in December 2003 to 2.4% in May 2004. Inflation rate forecasts of Bank analysts in the perspective of the next 11 months did not change (2.9%), however, the forecasts for the end of 2004 rose (3.0% against 2.6% last month). At the same time there was a further very strong growth of price increases expectations in retail trade, which reached the highest level since December 1997; there was a significant growth in the PPI indicator in April. This increase amounted to 2% in comparison with March, while producer price inflation accelerated from 4.9% in March to 7.5% in April on an annual basis, a level which was the highest since October 2000. Prepared analyses indicate that with relative continuity of the effective nominal exchange rate the acceleration of producer price inflation resulted foremost from producer prices increase in domestic sales which was a consequence of changes of raw material prices on world markets; the Polish economy is in a strong revival phase, whose growth rate exceeds earlier expectations, based on rapidly increasing export. However, there are also ever stronger signs of a significant revival of domestic demand. In April 2004, as compared to April 2003, industrial production was as a whole greater by 21.9%, with an increase of 25.2% in the processing industry. After seasonal trends, the growth in production as a whole amounted to 21.5%, with 24.9% in the processing industry. There was consolidation of the production growth trend in both the processing industry (with annual growth rate at 22.6%) as well as in industry as a whole (19.1%); retail sales have had a significant growth rate for several months (in March their value in current prices increased by 20.7% on an annual basis, and by 30.6% in April 2004). Such high growth rate of retail sales resulted partly from expectations of price increases after EU accession. However, even the high growth rate of those product sales as to which there were -3 - no price increase expectations after EU accession, indicates that the growth trend in retail trade may have a permanent basis; GUS studies in May of the general condition indicate that the seasonally adjusted assessment of the general condition of the processing industry remained at a level that was near to the highest level for the entire period studied, i.e. since 1992. There was a less pessimistic assessment of the condition in construction and trade than in the previous month; there are indications of renewed investment activity. There has been a next month of construction-assembly production increase (by 6.2% in March, by 25.7% in April). Production in the largest division of construction concerned with the elevation of buildings, civil and marine engineering increased by 29.8%, in enterprises performing finishing construction work by 40.8%. There is continued high sales level in cement and other construction materials. The very high growth rate in construction-assembly production and in sales of construction materials is also a result of introducing a significant increase in the VAT tax rate as of May 2004 for materials and construction services. In the 1st quarter of 2004 a further improvement was noted in the financial results of enterprises, which together with growing and high utilisation of production capacity allows to expect a revival of investment; supply factors constitute an ever greater threat to further increase in inflationary pressure. There are continued high oil prices and for a consecutive time there has been a successive increase in the forecast prices of this raw material. The current forecast of the average increase in the annual price of oil in 2004 increased by 3.3 USD/b in comparison with that forecast in April 2004. From September 2003 to April 2004 the price forecast increased from 26.0 USD/b to 34.7 USD/b. Furthermore, the price of foodstuffs in April increased significantly by 2.1%. The foodstuffs inflation rate for April amounted to 4.6% on an annual basis; -4 - lack of public finances reforms and political instability are the source of continued uncertainty on financial markets leading to an increase in the yield of treasury securities and the weakening of the zloty exchange rate. According to the NBP there is an increasing likelihood of exceeding the second prudential threshold, i.e. 55% of the GDP, already in 2004. The next meeting of the Council will take place 29  30 June 2004. -5 - External factors Economic activity indicators from April 2004 have not changed the general view of the international condition that has been in formation since the beginning of this year. Improvement In the US economy there is high growth rate in investment demand which has of confidence been confirmed by data on economic growth in the 1st quarter of 2004 (investments in the US increased by 9.2% in comparison with the 1st quarter of 2003, which were the most economy, dynamic component of domestic demand). Continued high level of indicators in the lack of condition of the corporate sector, increasing pace of orders in the processing industry, improvement and the strong growth in industrial production in April 2004 allow to expect that the in the euro upturn in the American economy will continue in the 2nd quarter of 2004. area However, there is a continued lack of clear signs of a permanent improvement of the condition in the euro area. External demand was the source of accelerated growth in the 1st quarter of 2004 in most economies of that region. There are, however, no signs of improvement in domestic demand, including consumer demand. Data for the 1st quarter regarding the activeness of retail trade and household confidence in the main countries of the euro area confirm the weakness of consumer demand that has continued in this region for already two years. The inflationary effects of the strong increase in oil prices became apparent in April 2004, which is confirmed in the clear acceleration of production costs in most economies. In light of increasing signs of economic upturn in the US economy there has been an increase in market expectation of a rates hike by the FED. In April 2004 the average price of Brent oil was 33.4 USD/b. In that month there High oil was a systematic price increase (by 4.2 USD, i.e. by 14%). This trend continued also in prices on the first half of May 2004 when the price of oil reached a level of nearly 40 USD/b and world hence the highest since 1990. Strong pressure on oil price increase was connected with markets increased tension in the Middle East. Expansion of military activities in Iraq and increased attacks on oil infrastructure constitutes a real threat to the continuity of oil supply. Increased economic growth in many parts of the world led the International Energy Agency to once again raise its forecast of world oil demand. According to these forecasts, the demand for oil this year will increase by 2 mln b/d and thus a biggest increase since 1988. A decrease in benzene supplies at the beginning of May 2004 was an added reason for an increase in oil prices. In May 2004 the Department of State for Energy increased the forecast of oil prices for 2004 to 34.7 USD/b and thus by as much as 3.3 USD in comparison with the forecast for April 2004. From the beginning of the year, the forecast of prices was increased by 6.4 USD by that institution. -6 - Economic situation in Poland According to initial NBP estimates, the rate of GNP growth in the 1st quarter of Higher than 2004 was significantly higher than in the 4th quarter of 2003 and amounted to about expected 6.4%. A faster growth in consumption and export while at the same time a relatively GNP growth low import were the deciding factors in the increased GNP rate of growth. in 1st quarter It is estimated that in the 1st quarter individual consumption was higher than last 2004 year by about 4.6%. An increase in purchasing power available to households was at a similar level, with the decisive factor being the highest since the beginning of 2002 rate of growth on earnings from wage labour and earnings from economic activity on own account in non-agricultural sections of the economy. It is estimated that in the 1st quarter 2004 export was higher by 18.8% than the year before, particularly on account of increased sales abroad of processing industry products and services The financial situation of enterprises in the 1st quarter 2004 was decidedly more Financial favorable than in the analogical period of the previous year. This is evidenced by a improvement significant improvement of all the indicators of effectiveness and increase in the of enterprises percentage of enterprises registering net profit (about 10 points percentage). The results of operational activity in the enterprise sector for the 1st quarter increased in comparison with the 1st quarter 2003 by 75.6%, while the net financial results more than four times, reaching the level of PLN 13.4 billion. In comparison with the 1st quarter 2003 losses from financial activity decreased by more than 50% , together increase in profits from the sale of products, goods and materials (by about 70%). Indicators showing the effectiveness of the enterprises sector improved in comparison with the 1st quarter of the previous year. Indicators of the level of costs from activity as a whole decreased by 3.1 points percentage thanks to a faster growth of earnings from economic activity as a whole (increase of 19.6%) than costs from that activity (increase of 15.8%). Liquidity indicator of 1st degree increased by 6 points percentage, exceeding the 20% level recognised as safe from the point of view of cash liquidity. 35.7% of enterprises obtained a liquidity of above 20%. Improvement in the indicators of cost levels and profitability of gross and net turnover was noted in all sections. There was also an improvement in the economic- financial situation of exporters in comparison with those observed last year, with the basic relations of effectiveness in that group of enterprises being more favorable than those of enterprises as a whole (with the exception of the liquidity of 1st degree indicator). In March 2004 there was again a decrease in the current account deficit. However. Improvement its decrease was clearly weaker than in the two previous months of 2004. In comparison in current woth march 2003 the current account deficit decreased by EUR 50 mln and amounted account to EUR 520 mln. The decrease in the negative current account balance was an influence balance of the positive balance of services (caused similarly as in the previous month by a high increase in export  on the basis of transactions was the highest balance noted and at the same time a decrease in export) and a decrease of the negative balance of earnings. A deficit increase in the turnover of goods had a negative influence on the change to the the current account balance. The deepening negative balance in the turnover of goods d in March 2004 (by EUR 200 mln) was the largest in the course of the last two years. This was a result of a higher rate of import growth (11.7% in comparison with March 2003) than for export (increase of 8.5%). The decrease of the positive transfer balance influenced the direction of the deepening current account balance. -7 - From the beginning of 2004 the current account deficit decreased by EUR 1,2 billion. In the first three months of 2004 the improvement in the current account balance was influenced foremost by a surplus excess in the exchange of services as well as a deficit decrease in the turnover of goods and earnings. However, the excess in current transfers was lower than in the 1st quarter of last year. In the period January  March 2004 the value of export increased by 12,8%, while the value of import increased by 8,5%. In as far as there was a decrease in the growth rate of export in comparison with previous months, in case of import an accelerated growth rate was observed. In comparison with the period January  March 2003 the growth rate in 2004 was nearly three times higher (with the value of import increasing by 3.3%). Export also showed itself to have a higher increase than in the previous year (in the period of the first months of last year it increased by 8.3%). GUS published initial data on industrial production growth was for a consecutive Increase in time higher than market expectations. In April the PPI indicator exceeded the 2003 industrial level by 21.9%. There was continued very high increase in processing industry and production whose volume exceeded the 2003 level by 25.2%. Construction-assembly construction- production, after the first in four years significant increase noted in March (by 6.2% assembly after correction), in April 2004 exceeded the 2003 level by as much as 25.8%. Such a production high increase is in our assessment partly a result of compensating for high losses from January and February, nevertheless the scale of the increase is surprising and demonstrates an actual revival of this branch. May GUS studies of the general condition indicate that the seasonally adjusted state of condition for the processing industry continued at a level near that of the highest one in the entire studied period, i.e. since 1992. The state of condition in construction and trade was assessed less pessimistically than in the previous month. According to April GUS data in comparison with March 2004 the average salary did not increase nominally and in real terms decreased by 0.8%. In comparison with April 2003 this increase amounted to nominally 4.6% (2.3% in real terms). On an increasing balance January  April 2004 the average salary in the enterprise sector increased nominally by 5.4% (by 3.5% in real terms), while in the analogous period of 2003 this increase was 2.4% (1.9%). There is continued increase in labour efficiency; in industry as a whole it increased in April 2004 by 22.4% on an annual basis (24.5% in March 2004) while in processing industry by 25.1% (by 28.0% in March 2004). There has been for several months an increased growth rate in retail sales (in March their value in current prices increased by 20.7% on an annual basis, by 30.6% in April). The very strong acceleration in the retail sales growth rate in March and April 2004  according to NBP estimates  was the main consequence of intensified purchases of goods prior to Poland's European Union accession. It is estimated that the acceleration in the retail sales rate to the extent of about 70% was caused by fears of price increases of goods after EU accession. Estimates show that this had the greatest effect on the automobile sector. -8 - Condition of public finance sector After four months of 2004 the combined state budget revenue was higher compared to the analogical period last year (9.4%) which is a good result in face of its forecast annual increase (1.2%). The degree of annual revenue plan realization was also higher than last year's level (32.9% as against 29.8% in the previous year). The high increase in indirect taxes (13.2% year on year), especially VAT, had the greatest influence by far on the formation of the state budget revenue in the period from the 1st to 4th quarters of this year. Especially strong influence from this title demonstrate an increase in retail sales stemming probably from increasing domestic demand and an increase in imports. There were also higher inflows from the CIT tax (6.2% year on year) that is probably a result of the improvement in the corporate financial situation. Significantly higher than in the previous year were also non-tax earnings (34.5%) mainly from the title of high customs duties inflow and earnings of state governmental units. The state budget expenditures after April of this year, similarly as in the previous month, were nominally lower than the expenditures last year (by 4% year on year) in comparison with their planned level of 5.6% for the entire year. Limitation of of state budget expenditures was influenced by significantly lower costs of servicing the public debt (by 13.3%), including domestic debt (by 25.7%) and subsidy for the FUS (Social Security Fund) (12%) and FP (Labour Fund), which for the first time was funded from the state budget in March 2004. Furthermore, general subsidy expenditures were characterised by a lower growth rate as well as subsidies for FER. As a result, the degree of realization of the annual revenue plan of budgetary expenditures reached 30.9% after four months of 2004 which means less than in the previous years. As a result of a favourable earnings situation and low level of budgetary Lower than expenditure, the state budget registered at the end of April 2004 a surplus (PLN 0.8). At in 2003 the end of April 2004 the level of the budget deficit amounted to PLN 10.99 bln advance in (24.3% of that planned), hence, significantly lower than the amount last year (46.4.% of expenditures that planned). and state The results after four months decrease the threat of a lower than planned budgetary budget deficit earnings in 2004. However, the key period for realizing the state financial plan will be after four the months of May  July 2004 due to the expected loss of earnings and increase in months of expenditures connected with the introduction from May 1 of settlements with the EU 2004 budget. There is continued good earnings condition of the FUS. FP. NFZ. Funds. This is to a great extent an effect of the growth in salaries and consequently high growth rate of premium payments. A continuation of this trend may contribute to a better than expected planned on this level financial situation of the above group of public sector entities. -9 - Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate In April 2004, compared with March 2004, money supply increased significantly. The M3 aggregate increased in April by PLN 8.2 bln (2.4 %). The exchange rate differences had major impact on it. After eliminating their influence the M3 increased by PLN 0.7 bln (2.1) which still constitute one of the highest monthly growth for the last two years. The annual nominal growth rate of the M3 aggregate was 8.4 % and it achieved the highest value since December 2001. The observed growth of the M3 aggregate resulted mainly from important increase in deposits and corporate loans as well as commitments to the sector of other non-monetary financial institutions. The deposits and other commitments towards enterprises were still showing an increasing trend which has been observed since the end of the last year. Compared with March 2004 they increased by PLN 6.1 bln (9.3 %). After eliminating the influence of fluctuating exchange rates the increase amounted to PLN 5.9 bln. The annual growth rate of corporate deposits in April was equal 20.9 % - the most since July 2000. Such a significant increase in corporate deposits in April should be connected with an increase in the economic growth rate and also with a quickly increasing value of sales which stemmed from fear of an expected price increase after Poland's EU accession. In April of this year household deposits at banks decreased by PLN 1.4 bln (0.7 %).After removing the influence of exchange rate fluctuations their decrease was even more significant and amounted to PLN 2.4 bln (1.2 %). Negative growth rate of the household deposits slightly increased to -1.6 %. It was not , however, the only result of the exchange rate fluctuations (strong appreciation of gold a year ago in conjunction with major depreciation in April of this year). The level of household savings as an alternative to bank deposits did not significantly change in comparison with March. The state of cash in circulation outside bank tills increased in April 2004 by PLN 1.6 bln (3.1 %). The major growth rate of cash in circulation, at the end of April, just before the long weekend, is a typical phenomenon. The annual growth rate of cash in circulation dropped down to 12 % which is the lowest value since December 2002. Among factors of money supply creation debtors increased nominally by PLN 5.9 bln (2.2 %). After eliminating the influence of fluctuating exchange rates this growth amounted to PLN 4.5 bln (1.7%). Changes in the state of debtors among other things resulted from the significant increase in households indebtedness. In April of this year a significant increase in household bank loans was observed. The household debt increased by PLN 4.3 bln (4.1 %). After removing the influence of exchange rate fluctuations the real change in the debt amounted to PLN 3.7 bln (3.6 %). The annual nominal growth rate of household loans increased from 13.1 % in March to 18.2 % in April of this year. High growth rate of household debt in the Fall of 2003 almost completely stemmed from the increase in housing credits. April data received from banks show also an increase in volume of car loans, furniture purchase and household and RTV equipment. The debt increase to achieve the above mentioned objectives probably stemmed from a fear of price increase after Poland's EU accession. This may be a reason for its isolated character. #NAME? In April bank corporate indebtedness increased nominally from PLN Low growth 0.3 bln (0.2 %) which stemmed entirely from the zloty depreciation. After eliminating rate for the influence of exchange rate fluctuations the enterprise indebtedness in the banking corporate sector decreased by PLN 0.4 bln (0.3%). The annual growth rate of corporate loans indebtedness increased nominally from  0.5 % in March to 0.8 % in April2004.Such an increase resulted entirely from the exchange rate differences. The loan demand of enterprises may be limited by a significant increase in the availability of their own resources. In the period of 22 April to 21 May 2004 the zloty strengthened against the euro by 2% and 3.9% against the dollar (from the beginning of the year the EUR/PLN Drop in bond exchange rarte has strengthened somewhat while USD/PLN rose by 4.2%). In the last prices twelve months the zloty weakened against the euro by 7.5% and 5.9% against the strongest for dollar. 2-year bonds Uncertainties resulting from political risk and existing dangers for the continuation of indispensable public finances reforms is the cause of the continuation of a long-term depreciation trend for the zloty. In May, fluctuations of the zloty resulted from a changing market assessment as to the chances of calling a government of Premier Belka and the publication of macroeconomic data for April. A downward trend continued on treasury bonds market. From the last meeting of the MPC benchmark bond prices decreased. As a result the yield on 2-year, 5-year and 10-year bonds increased in this period by 53, 26 and 28 b.p. respectively (from the beginning of the year this change was 128, 107 and 86 b.p. respectively). This trend was influence to a greatest extent by factors of a domestic character, which is demonstrated by an increase in yield variability of 2-, 5-, and 10-year bonds in respect of an analogical eurobond area. Confirmation of a continued high investment risk is the lowering of Poland's long-term rating in domestic currency by Fitch Ratings. Similarly, as in April, the high growth rate of industrial production strengthened expectations of a rates hike. Because of this, 2-year bonds, which are most sensitive to rates changes by the central bank, lost the most on their value. Prices, inflationary expectations In April 2004 the annual CPI was 2.2% (1.7% in March). In comparison with April 2003, the highest increases in prices were in foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages (4.6%), prices for apartment usage and power carriers (3.0%) prices in Significant transport (3.5%), including cost of fuels (4.7%). Lower than in April 2003 were prices growth in of clothing and footwear. PPI indicator In April 2004 there was an increase in the base inflation indicators from 1.2% (net inflation) on an annual basis to 2.3% (base inflation indicator after excluding controlled prices). The PPI increased in April 2004 significantly above market expectations and amounted to 7.5% on an annual basis, and at the same time was set at the highest level since October 2000. -11 - NBP analysis show that up to February 2004 the price producer price increases were a result chiefly of prices obtained in export. The index of domestic prices remained stable and amounted to about 2% on an annual basis. In March and April 2004 there was a change and the producer prices in the processing industry section were stimulated by domestic prices. This is chiefly connected with price increases in the following divisions: production of coke and oil refinery - where in that division the earnings from export sales amounted in 2003 to 6.3% - and metals production. After excluding these two divisions from the processing industry section the April prices would have increased by about 0.6% in comparison with March, hence, on the level of January and February. An increase in the PPI in the section of processing industry have to a great extent a supply character resulting from the increase in oil and metals prices on world markets. In divisions less dependent on raw material significantly smaller price increase are noted. The inflation rate expectations of individuals in May 2004 , within the next 12 months, amounts to 2.4% (by 0.1 point percentage more than in the previous month). Bank analysts forecast that in December 2004 the inflation rate will be 3.0% (an increase of 0.4 point percentage), in April 2005 at 2.9% (no change), while the average annual rate of inflation in 2005 at 2.9% (increase of 0.1 point percentage)."
Philippines,2004-06-02,"The Monetary Board decided today to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The BSP's policy rates were last changed on 2 July 2003 when the rates were cut by 25 basis points. The latest assessment by the Monetary Board suggests that the outlook for inflation in 2004 remains consistent with the 4-5 percent inflation target for the year. However, supply-side factors such as transport cost adjustments, utility charge increases, and rising energy prices continue to dominate the risks to the outlook for inflation in 2005 and point to a possible uptrend in average inflation above the 4-5 percent target. However, the Monetary Board is of the opinion that the expected inflationary pressures over the policy horizon do not represent permanent shifts in the long-run price path and therefore should not require a monetary policy response. Inflationary pressures resulting from supply-side factors are largely outside the influence of monetary policy and therefore do not require action from monetary authorities. At the same time, the Monetary Board believes that the overall likelihood of significant demand-driven pressures on consumer prices developing in the near term remains low given continued evidence of double-digit unemployment, spare manufacturing capacity and modest bank loan growth. Indeed, the Monetary Board is of the opinion that the continuing patterns of sluggish credit demand and modest investment growth suggest that the policy stance should continue to support the real sector and provide adequate stimulus to credit activity. The weak trend in investments constitutes a downside risk to the sustainability of output growth in the medium term, and such a risk calls for a need to exercise caution in considering possible adjustments in policy rates in the future. Possible wage adjustment which could affect the demand for money has been factored into the inflation models to the extent of 9 percent starting July 2004 and 4 percent in July 2005. Given the above considerations, the Monetary Board believes that the present stance of monetary policy is fully consistent with the expected path of inflation over the next two years. In the near term, the BSP will continue to monitor closely all developments that may affect the outlook for inflation and inflation expectations over the policy horizon."
Euroarea,2004-06-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. However. I should first like to inform you about some decisions we have taken regarding the publication of staff macroeconomic projections. As you are aware, twice a year Eurosystem staff, that is, staff of the ECB and the euro area national central banks, jointly produce a set of macroeconomic projections. These serve as one of the inputs into the deliberations of the Governing Council. Subsequently, the projections are published in the June and December issues of the Monthly Bulletin. As you also know, in the interim period, that is, for March and September. ECB staff produce what is basically an update of the Eurosystem staff projections. These projections also serve as input into the meetings of the Governing Council, but so far have not been published. The positive experience and familiarity gained over the past few years with the publication of macroeconomic projections have given us the confidence to go a step further by also publishing the interim ECB staff projections. Therefore, in the spirit of transparency and accountability, the ECB staff projections will also be published from September 2004 onwards. In all cases, that is, four times a year, the projections will be published in the appropriate form in the Monthly Bulletin. In addition, as a further step towards providing relevant information in a timely manner, we will from today onwards provide you with an advance copy of the Monthly Bulletin section covering the projections. This advance copy will be made available shortly after the end of this press conference, both in hard copy and on the ECB's website. The same procedure will be applied in September and every three months thereafter. The fact that we have decided to publish the interim ECB staff projections in future does not change their role as one of the inputs into our deliberations. The Governing Council continues to base its monetary policy decisions on a comprehensive economic analysis, which is cross-checked with the monetary analysis. In summary, we noted that the economic recovery has strengthened over recent months. At the same time, we have also witnessed stronger inflationary pressures over the short term. Nevertheless, we are still of the view that the medium-term outlook remains in line with price stability. The low level of interest rates continues to support the economic recovery. We will remain vigilant with regard to all developments which could affect the risks to price stability over the medium term. In the context of our economic analysis, the latest data releases confirm that the economic recovery in the euro area is under way. According to Eurostat, real GDP grew by 0.6% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of this year, and quarterly real GDP growth for the fourth quarter of last year was revised upwards from 0.3% to 0.4%. The more pronounced pace of real GDP growth mainly reflected both stronger private consumption and buoyant exports. Latest survey data still provide mixed signals with regard to the underlying strength of the recovery but remain fully consistent with ongoing growth in the current quarter. Looking ahead, the conditions for a continuation of the recovery remain in place. Economic growth outside the euro area continues to be strong and should promote export growth. On the domestic side, investment should benefit from the positive global environment as well as from the favourable financing conditions. Improvements in corporate efficiency and higher profits are also supporting business investment. Moreover, private consumption should gradually recover from the stagnation witnessed during most of 2003, broadly in line with growth in real disposable income which, with the usual lag, should be further underpinned by an increase in employment growth later on. Accordingly, we expect an ongoing recovery in euro area economic growth over the coming quarters, leading to a broader and stronger upswing in the course of next year. This is also reflected in the Eurosystem staff projections, which envisage euro area real GDP growth of between 1.4% and 2.0% on average in 2004, rising to between 1.7% and 2.7% in 2005. Available forecasts from international and private organisations convey a broadly similar picture. With regard to this scenario, there are risks and uncertainties in both directions. On the one hand, the current rather robust pace of economic growth outside the euro area, the recent development in private consumption as well as some survey data imply a potential for stronger growth dynamics, particularly in the short term. On the other hand, high oil prices could pose a downside risk. Over a longer horizon, concerns also remain about the persistence of global imbalances. Concerning prices, recent oil price developments have created considerable upward pressure on consumer prices. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in May, partly due to base effects, after standing at 2.0% in April. Markets expect oil prices to decline gradually from recent peaks. If they were to remain at their recent high levels, it is to be expected that inflation rates would continue to be higher than previously anticipated and stay above 2% for longer than just a few months ahead. When assessing price trends over the medium term, however, the outlook remains favourable. In particular, overall import price developments should remain moderate and inflationary pressure from wages and unit labour costs should be contained. Both factors should help to bring annual rates of consumer price inflation back to below 2% in 2005. These views are in line with the Eurosystem staff projections, which put average annual HICP inflation at between 1.9% and 2.3% in 2004 and between 1.1% and 2.3% in 2005. They are also broadly consistent with recently released forecasts by international and private organisations. These forecasts and projections are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Moreover, there is insufficient knowledge today about future changes in indirect taxes and administered prices; information on these items typically becomes available only towards the end of the year. Against this background, the potential risk for second-round effects via wages needs to be monitored closely. Finally, there has been an increase in measures of long-term inflation expectations derived from financial market indicators. While these indicators should be interpreted with caution, the recent upward trend calls for particular vigilance. Moving on to the monetary analysis, we have seen increasing evidence of a normalisation of the portfolio behaviour of private investors. As a consequence, annual M3 growth has fallen quite significantly over recent quarters. Still, the low level of interest rates continues to fuel monetary growth and the amount of excess liquidity remains high in the euro area. In an economic upswing, the persistence of excess liquidity could lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that the main scenario for the outlook for price developments over the medium term remains in line with price stability. However, short-term pressures on inflation have increased recently and some upside risks need to be taken into account. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis also supports the case for vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability. Given the signs that the economic recovery will continue, it is particularly important that fiscal policies and structural reforms play their part in improving the economic fundamentals of the euro area. It is regretful that recent fiscal developments have not been helpful in this respect. A growing number of countries are reporting significant imbalances and fiscal consolidation efforts fall disappointingly short of commitments. In order to strengthen confidence in a sustainable upswing, it is now essential that clarity about the future course of consolidation of fiscal policies is re-established in all countries concerned. This requires credible measures with an emphasis on structural expenditure reform so that imbalances are redressed, tax/benefit systems become more growth-friendly and social security systems are put on a sound financial footing. These measures, together with a revived momentum towards effectively implementing structural reforms in labour and product markets, would provide very valuable support to the current economic upswing."
Peru,2004-06-03,"Press Release BOARD OF THE CENTRAL BANK APPROVED MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2004 REFERENCE INTEREST RATE IS KEPT AT 2,50% In May the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.35 percent, due to transitory shocks in the supply of foods and fuels. Cumulative inflation through last 12 month reached 3.18 percent, higher than in April (2.78 percent), since May 2003 rate was negative in 0.03 percent. Core inflation, a price indicator that excludes high volatility items was 2.53 percent over last 12 months. Inflation in 2004 and 2005 is expected to meet the target range (1.5-3.5 percent). However, 12 month inflation might be transitorily over this range in some months of the year due to supply shocks and an statistical effect since inflation was negative between April and July 2003. The average interbank interest rate was 2.48 percent in May, similar to April (2.49 percent). For June, the Board of the Central Bank decided to maintain the reference interest rates for monetary operations off auction: 3.25 percent: for direct repos and monetary regulation credits 1.75 percent: for overnight deposits. The monetary operations regarding injection or withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be made in order to place the interbank interest rate in the center of this corridor of reference interest rates (2,50 percent). In case the market interbank interest rate be higher than 3,25 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. For June, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCR is 170  190 million. This balance is neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it is also affected by seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes. The interest rates for Central Bank‘s operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP's deposits held abroad Swaps, the commission that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.25 percent is maintained July Monetary Program will be considered in the Board of Directors meeting of July 1, 2004."
Romania,2004-06-07,"The National Bank of Romania Board has considered the latest developments in disinflation and external accounts, as well as the future trends, and has decided to lower the policy rate by half of a percentage point. For the period ahead, the National Bank of Romania will maintain the cautious monetary policy stance, closely in line with the developments in aggregate demand and imports, still growing at a rapid pace, which is likely to put at risk disinflation and external accounts. The National Bank of Romania Board underscores its resolve to keep monetary policy on course to meet the inflation target of 9 percent for end-2004 and 6 percent for end-2005."
Thailand,2004-06-09,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 9 June 2004 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Deputy Governor. Monetary Stability. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Thailand met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows. The MPC viewed that the Thai economy continued to expand favourably despite of the slight moderation in growth to 65 per cent in the first quarter of 2004 due to the impact of the avian flu and the drought effects on agriculture, while the non-agricultural sector continued to expand well. The MPC was confident that improved economic fundamentals, for example, the recovery in private investment which expanded by 188 per cent in the last 4 months, should help the economy to withstand any negative influence reasonably well and should help facilitate economic expansion going forward. Internal stability remained strong with low rate of inflation. External stability was robust. The issue of concern by the MPC was the uncertainties pertaining to rising oil prices which should be closely monitored going forward. The MPC deemed rising international interest rates likely, but the yield curve in the bond market had already priced-in that possibility to a certain extent. Against this background, the MPC assessed that although current inflation remained low, going forward, inflation could accelerate and thus render a close monitoring of inflationary pressures. The MPC deemed that for the time being, the current stance of monetary policy appropriate given the current conditions. The MPC thus decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 125 per cent per annum."
Chile,2004-06-10,"The Central Bank of Chile Press Release* Santiago, 10 June 2004 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 1.75% (annual). Overall information since the last meeting is consistent with output and price forecasts in the last Monetary Policy Report. Alongside substantial expansion of foreign trade figures, the gradual increase in product and expenditure growth rates continues. As previously anticipated, monthly inflation in May increased due to the incidence of movements in fuel prices and the exchange rate, an effect that is believed to be mainly temporary. Core inflation CPIX (that excludes some goods with more volatile prices) remains low. In the near future, the annual CPI inflation is expected to progressively converge to 3% during the usual 24-month policy horizon. The Central Bank of Chile reiterates that it will continue to conduct monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to address any projected inflation deviations in either direction from the specified target inflation rate. In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
South Africa,2004-06-10,"The rate of CPIX inflation has remained well within the target range of 3-6 per cent for the past eight months, i.e. from September 2003 to April 2004, despite increases in international oil prices. In general most factors favour a continuation of inflation within this range and inflation expectations have generally improved. Recent evidence indicates that there has been an acceleration in economic growth. South Africa has now experienced eighteen (18) consecutive quarters of economic expansion, this being the longest upward phase of the business cycle on record. The twelve-month rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost of mortgage bonds (the CPIX) decreased from 11,3 per cent in October and November 2002 to 4,4 per cent in both March and April 2004. Although these latest rates of inflation are marginally above the year-on-year rate of 4,0 per cent in December 2003, they have remained well within the inflation target range. The rates of increase over twelve months in the prices of consumer goods have been below the lower limit of the inflation target range since October 2003 and amounted to 2,6 per cent in April 2004. By contrast, prices of consumer services continued to increase at year-on-year rates of around 8 per cent over this same period and only recently came down to 7,6 per cent in April 2004. Increases in administered prices were mainly responsible for the continued high increases in the prices of services. Measured from quarter to quarter and adjusted for seasonal factors. CPIX inflation accelerated from an annualised rate of 1,1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2003 to 7,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2004. Seasonally adjusted and annualised, the month-to-month increase in the CPIX amounted to 5,8 per cent in April. These higher rates could mainly be attributed to increases in the prices of petrol, alcoholic beverages and tobacco, and were related to increases in international oil prices and excise duties. In addition to the monetary and fiscal discipline applied by the authorities, the steadier performance of the exchange rate of the rand has continued to contribute to the maintenance of price stability. Improved agricultural conditions from the beginning of 2004 also assisted in moderating consumer food price increases. However, the prices of fresh meat started to rise rapidly in the first four months of 2004. Together with increases in the rates charged for electricity, gas and water and international oil prices, this contributed to a reversal in the rate of decline in the all-goods production price index. While production prices continued to decrease in the first four months of 2004, the year-on-year rate of decline slowed down from 2,5 per cent in November 2003 to 0,2 per cent in April 2004. This was mainly due to an increase in the year-on-year change in prices of domestically produced goods from 0,2 per cent to 2,1 per cent over the same period. However the prices of imported goods declined further at relatively high rates in the first four months of 2004. In the short run, developments in international oil prices, through their impact on domestic fuel costs, are likely to be a source of supply-side upwards pressure on inflation. The monthly average spot price of Brent crude oil increased from US $25,0 per barrel in April 2003 to US $37,5 per barrel in May 2004 and on some days exceeded US $40 per barrel. Geopolitical uncertainties together with a strong growth in demand, a curtailment of production and the build-up of strategic stocks were mainly responsible for this price behaviour. Over the short term, the announced intention to increase oil production of OPEC countries in July and August 2004, should hopefully help to reduce prices below recent peak levels. But it is unclear whether prices will fall back fully to the OPEC target band. Over the medium to longer term, oil demand and supply are expected to be more or less in balance which could lead to a correction in international prices. Against this background and taking all other factors into account, it is possible that year-on-year rates of increase in the CPIX could temporarily breach the upper level of the target band towards the end of 2004 and the early part of 2005. Any such breach is expected to be short-lived, with the likelihood that CPIX inflation will return to within the range shortly thereafter. Looking further ahead, the inflation outlook generally remains favourable and inflation expectations also support this view. Despite a sharp rise in international commodity prices, world inflation is expected to remain at low levels. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that the annual percentage change in global consumer prices will decline from 3,7 per cent in 2003 to 3,2 per cent in 2005. This lower inflation is forecast within an environment of continued world economic growth notwithstanding current higher international oil prices. The rate of increase in domestic production picked up in the first quarter of 2004. Faster growth in output is likely to be sustained throughout this year and 2005 given the strength of domestic demand. For the moment, domestic producers still have considerable excess production capacity, so that at present pressures arising from supply constraints do not appear to be having a marked effect on domestic production price increases. Moreover, the growth rate of total real gross domestic fixed capital formation amounted to 8½ per cent in 2003 and preliminary information indicates that it continued to grow at a high rate in the first quarter of 2004. Although government in its latest Budget projected the public-sector borrowing requirement as a ratio of gross domestic product to rise somewhat from 2,8 per cent in fiscal 2003/04 to 3,2 per cent in fiscal 2004/05, the budget proposals also indicated that this is intended to be a temporary phenomenon. It is envisaged that this ratio will decline again to 2,7 per cent in fiscal 2006/07, clearly demonstrating the determination of the government to preserve fiscal discipline. Recent announcements by the government indicate a greater determination to take active steps to moderate administered price increases within the context of inflation targeting. With the exception of meat and deciduous fruit prices, the outlook for most other food prices generally seems to be favourable. Paradoxically, meat prices usually rise with improved agricultural conditions when farmers postpone the marketing of livestock. The prices of deciduous fruit will probably be affected by the current low rainfall in the Western Cape. Favourable agricultural conditions in the rest of the country should help to contain increases in other food prices. Domestic final demand continued to increase substantially in the first quarter of 2004 as substantiated by indicators such as retail sales, the sales of motor vehicles and credit extension to households. The impact of the increase in domestic expenditure on South Africa's trade balance was moderated somewhat by the acceleration in the growth of domestic production. As a result, the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments is likely to be smaller than was the case in the fourth quarter of 2003. Preliminary estimates suggest that this deficit was more than fully financed by a surplus on the financial account, including unrecorded transactions. These transactions enabled the Reserve Bank to increase its gross international reserves further from US $8,2 billion at the end of December 2003 to US $10,0 billion at the end of March 2004. At the end of May 2004 these reserves stood at about US $10,5 billion. In view of these developments the external value of the rand has been more stable in the first five months of 2004 than in the preceding three years. Growth in money supply and total loans and advances of banks remains fairly brisk while the income velocity of circulation was at a historically low level of 1,6 in the first quarter of 2004. The twelve-month growth rate in the broadly defined M3 increased from 12,3 per cent in December 2003 to 14,9 per cent in February 2004, before coming down to 12,4 per cent in April. Twelve-month growth in total loans and advances of around 12 per cent was recorded from April 2003 to March 2004. In April this growth receded to 9,9 per cent, mainly on account of high base effects. The increase in the average nominal remuneration per worker amounted to 8,6 per cent in 2003 and wage settlements in collective bargaining agreements are predicted to average between 7½ and 8½ per cent for 2004. Although this indicates a declining trend when compared with the year-to-year rate of increase in labour remuneration per worker of about 9½ per cent in 2002, it is still considerably in excess of productivity increases. Nominal unit labour cost accordingly continued to increase at high rates. Particularly disconcerting is the fact that nominal unit labour cost in manufacturing enterprises rose by as much as 11,2 per cent in 2003. This could give rise to inflationary pressures in domestic production prices. Taking the above-mentioned factors into consideration, in particular the risks to the inflation outlook, together with further increases in domestic demand, the Monetary Policy Committee has nevertheless decided to maintain the current monetary policy stance and keep the repo rate unchanged at 8,0 per cent per annum. The Monetary Policy Committee will continue to monitor all the risk factors to the inflation outlook. If the outlook changes, the Committee will review its stance."
Nigeria,2004-06-20,"PRESS RELEASE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA. COMMUNIQUE NO. 36 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE IN JUNE, 2004 On the recommendation of its Monetary Policy Committee, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has decided to recall N745 billion of public sector funds lodged with deposit money banks, with effect from July 21, 2004. The policy action, which represents a tightening of monetary policy stance, is designed to stem the continued high demand pressure in the foreign exchange market, and acceleration of the inflation rate. Available information on price developments in May, 2004 indicated that the inflation rate, on twelve-month moving average basis, exceeded the 175 per cent recorded in April, 2004. Moreover the daily average demand for foreign exchange remained unsustainably high at US$4603 and US$4790 million in June and May 2004, respectively, while the level of gross official external reserves recorded only a modest increase during the month, despite the substantial rise in net inflow. Overall the naira exchange rate depreciated in the Bureaux de Change (BDC) market, although the rate appreciated marginally in the Dutch Auction System (DAS) segment of the market, due to increased supply of foreign exchange by the CBN. The effect was reflected in the further widening of the spread between the DAS and the BDC exchange rates. In the month under review, the growth in monetary aggregates remained broadly within the programme targets, helped mainly by the continued fall in bank credit to Federal Government. The Committee, nevertheless, emphasized the need for proactive monetary policy actions to ensure the sustenance of this positive development, recognizing the potential risk to macroeconomic stability posed by anticipated bunched government spending on capital projects during the second half of this year. In this regard, the phased recall of public sector funds with the deposit money banks will be sustained until the need for re-injection of liquidity arises. Meanwhile the Committee will continue to closely monitor developments in the economy, with a view to taking appropriate action to fine-tune the current policy measures. James K Olekah Secretary.

Israel,2004-06-28,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program forJuly 2004. The Bank of Israel today announced that in the context of its monetary program for July 2004, the interest rate will be unchanged at 4.1 percent. From the end of 2002 to April 2004 the interest rate was cut by a cumulative 5 percentage points. The decision to leave the interest rate unchanged for the third month in succession is based on the expectation that inflation one and two years forward will follow a path consistent with that of price stability, i.e., 1-3 percent a year. Inflation expectations derived from the capital market and the predictions of private forecasters for the next twelve months are around 2 percent. In addition, developments in the capital market, and in particular in the government bond market and the foreign-currency market, give strong support to the decision not to change the interest rate for July. In the government bond marketthe upward trend in yields evident since the beginning of the year has halted, and since the beginning of June they have actually declined slightly. This change, which can be explained by the increasing likelihood that the government will meet its deficit target of 4 percent of GDP in 2004 and by surplus borrowing by the government in the first half of theyear, also led to a halt in the widening of the differential between the yield on government bonds and the Bank of Israel\'s interest rate. This widening differential is inconsistent in the long term with price stability. The foreign-currency market is calm, with the main developments being acertain strengthening of the NIS and, recently, relatively moderate fluctuations, chiefly connected with external factors; no clear market trend is evident, despite the latest occurrences in the political arena. Thedecision not to change the interest rate for July means that short-term real interest continues at a very low level of about 2.2 percent,. This policy isintended to continue supporting economic recovery, as long as the Bank of Israel assesses that this is consistent with price stability, which is oneof the conditions necessary for the creation of sustained growth. It is important that the government continue to maintain the credibility of its macroeconomic policy that focuses on the long-term budget targets that it set, that it persist in carrying out structural reforms such as those in the labor market, public services, the Ports Authority andthe financial markets, and that it ensure that the infrastructure investment program is executed at a faster pace. The right decisions in the discussions on the budget for 2005 that are scheduled to start in July will play a significant role in the assessment of whether the economy'. The differentials between the Bank of Israel's interest rate, both current and expected, and those of other central banks continue to contract, and the Bank of Israel's interest rate is still lower than that of the central banks of someadvanced economies (the UK. Australia and New Zealand). This trend supports short-term capital outflow from Israel, and the balance in the foreign-currency market is maintained at present by long-term capital inflow accompanying economic growth. <span dir 3DLTR>a.

Philippines,2004-06-30,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided today to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The BSP's policy rates were last changed on 2 July 2003 when the rates were cut by 25 basis points. The latest assessment by Monetary Board suggests that prevailing conditions for output and inflation continue to support the argument for maintaining the present monetary settings. The inflation environment in the months ahead does not warrant a shift towards an immediate monetary tightening given that the recent uptrend in both headline and core inflation could be traced to relative price changes involving selected CPI components and, therefore, is not broad-based. Demand-side pressures on consumer prices also continue to be tempered by evidence of double-digit unemployment, spare manufacturing capacity, and subdued activity in both lending and investments. The Monetary Board is also of the view that current expectations of an above-target headline inflation rate in 2005 are largely tied to supply-side developments particularly, higher energy prices, which led to the recent wage and transport fare adjustments, in addition to increases in utilities charges. The impact of these supply-side factors on inflation is likely to be transitory and thus, is not likely to be influenced by monetary action. At the same time, the Monetary Board believes that the conditions for output growth continue to suggest a need for policy stimulus to remain in place. The presence of continued soft spots in domestic demand, absence of any sharp upswing in credit and investment activity, and the possibility of downside risks to external demand given expectations of tighter money in the major economies argue against the withdrawal of the policy stimulus to the real sector. The Monetary Board also believes that the 25 basis point increase in the US Federal fund rate does not warrant a corresponding increase in the BSP policy rate at this point. Most markets have already priced in the US policy without significant repercussion on the peso whose volatility could have inflationary impact. The Board affirmed its position that BSP should be concerned with exchange rate volatility when there is threat of disorderly movement and when such movements could affect price stability. In light of these conditions, the Monetary Board is of the opinion that the prevailing monetary settings remain appropriate given the current demand and supply conditions. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor carefully all developments that may affect the assessment of risks to inflation and inflation expectations over policy horizon. Monetary policy will continue to focus on ensuring price stability while remaining supportive of the economy's growth objective."
Poland,2004-06-30,"Warsaw, 30 June 2004 INFORMATION FROM A MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 29-30 June 2004 On 29-30 May 2004 the Monetary Policy Council held a meeting. The Council read materials prepared by the Management Board and the NBP Departments, as well as information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council discussed the external environment of the Polish economy as well as real trends in the area of payments and social welfare benefits, trends in the public finance sector, trends in the money supply, loans and interest rates, and in the formation of pricing and inflationary expectations as well as inflationary prospects. The annual inflation rate rose from 2.2% in April 2004 to 3.4% in May 2004  to a level significantly higher than expected, nearing the upper limit of the permissible deviation from the inflation target. There was a further significant increase in the PPI indicator  to a level of 9.6%. There were also strong increases in all measurements of the base inflation rate from a level of 1.2%-2.3% in April 2004 to 2.0%-3.7% in May 2004. Inflation forecasts by NBP experts signal the risk of a further increase in inflation. Observed acceleration of inflation is to a large extent a result of the growth in the prices of fuels and food, an increase in indirect tax rates and other factors connected with Poland's EU accession. This type of price increases does not have to lead to a permanently increased inflation if it does not strengthen inflationary expectations and in effect does not lead to further increase in salaries and prices. With this as background it is significant that increased inflation expectations of households, took place even before the publication of the inflation data for May 2004. Since the beginning of 2003 there has also been a systematic growth in expectations of price increases in retail trade. Risk of inflation growth, which is connected with increasing inflationary expectations, is increased by a significant growth in domestic demand. Conducted analyses indicate that the slowing down of the growth rate of the PPI and of retail sales, noted in May 2004, resulted chiefly from the compensatory acceleration effect during the period of March- April, connected with Poland's EU accession. This means maintenance of the strong growth trend of these measurements which has been observed for many months. Endeavouring that the increased inflation has a transitory character and that, after the expiry of extraordinary factors, it returns to a level in line with the MPC's inflationary target (2.5%), the Council has resolved to raise the NBP rates by 0.5 point percentage to the level of: reference rate 5.75% on an annual basis; lombard rate 7.25% on an annual basis; deposit rate 4.25% on an annual basis. The Council maintains its restrictive monetary policy stance. The resolutions of the MPC come into force as of 1 July 2004. I. Factors favouring a low inflation rate: growth rate in corporate loans has decreased; its annual growth rate was at 2.3% in May 2004 against 0.7% in April 2004. Corporate demand for credit may be limited by the still high level of their own financial sources which remain at their disposal; continued high growth rate of labour efficiency; in May 2004 it increased in industry as a whole by 12.8.% on an annual basis (by 22.4% in April 2004) while in the processing industry by 14% (by 25.1% in April 2004); continued high unemployment, which could to a certain degree limit pressure on salary increases. In May 2004 the average salary in the enterprises sector rose by 4.4% in comparison with May 2003 as compared with the increase by 4.6% in the period from April 2003 to April 2004. II. Factors giving rise to the risk of inflation growth: from the beginning of the year inflationary expectations of households are increasing. Inflation rate expectations of individuals within the next 12 months rose from 1.6% in December 2003 to 2.7% in June 2004. Inflation rate forecasts of bank analysts for the end of 2004 did not change (3.0%), however, the inflation forecasts for the next 11 months decreased insignificantly (2.7%) as well as the forecast of the average annual inflation in 2005 (2.8%). Both surveys were conducted at a time when the size of inflation for May 2004 was not known. At the same time there was a further growth in price increase expectations in retail trade. Traders are signaling further price increases, mainly in foodstuffs. The general condition indicator informing of planned price increases for foodstuffs has been increasing systematically from the beginning of 2003; there are significant increases in the PPI indicator. In May 2004 they increased by 1.2% in comparison with April, while producer prices inflation on an annual basis accelerated from 7.5% in April to 9.6% in May 2004 - a level which was the highest since December 1997. NBP analyses indicate that the acceleration of producer prices inflation resulted foremost from producer prices increase in domestic sales which was amongst others a consequence of changes of raw material prices on world markets. The Polish economy is in a strong revival phase, whose growth rate exceeds earlier expectations. In Q1 of 2004 the GNP growth rate was 6.9% in comparison with 4.7% in Q4 of 2003. T main factor of the strong GNP growth was domestic demand which exceeded the level of a year ago by as much as 5.7% in comparison with 2.6% in Q4 in 2003. In Q1 of 2004 an increase in gross investment expenditures was also noted, which amounted to 3.5%, in comparison with 0.1% in Q4 of 2003. May 2004 was a further month in the growth rate of the sold production of industry. Industrial production as a whole was greater by 12.3%, with 14.3% on an annual basis 2 in the processing industry. After seasonal adjustments, the total production growth was 14.9% on an annual basis, with 17.1% in the processing industry. While the April growth of construction-assembly production was not maintained, however, in connection with the observed phenomena of issuing invoices for a portion of works in April, it is estimated that in the period of April  May construction- assembly production was higher than a year before by about 4.5%, which indicates a gradual revival of a growth trend in this industry branch. GUS study published on 22 June 2004 of the general condition indicates a further improvement in the climate of the general condition in the processing industry. An assessment of the climate of the general condition, taking account of seasonal adjustments, was the highest for the entire period studied, i.e. since 1992. There was also improvement in the assessment of the climate of general condition in construction and trade than in the previous month. monetary policy is conducted with a lax fiscal policy and a lack of clear perspectives as to the scale of reforms, which could lead to the recovery of public finances; supply factors may lead to a further increase in inflationary pressure. Oil prices continue at a high level and the forecast prices of this raw material were very insignificantly decreased. The current forecast of the average annual price of oil in 2004 was deceased by 0.4 USD/b in comparison with the forecast in May 2004. From September 2003 to June 2004 the forecast prices increased from 26.0 USD/b to 34.3 USD/b. The price of foodstuffs in May 2004 increased by 0.6%, while the foodstuffs inflation rate for May amounted to 5.2% on an annual basis. In the first half of June the price of foodstuffs rose in comparison with May 2004 by 2.4%. The next meeting of the Council will take place 27-28 July 2004. 3 External factors Significant increase in the price of oil in April and May 2004, accompanying other price increases in energy carriers negatively influenced the May survey results of consumer expectation in the US and in the euro area. Weakening of price pressure on the oil market in June brought American consumers back to an optimistic mood. Evidence of a high growth rate of demand in US households found confirmation in accelerated retail sales as well as a clearly higher than expected increase in number of permits for the construction of houses in May 2004. In May and June there was also an improvement in the situation on the American labour market. There was a clear above market expectations increase in US industrial production, which influenced an increase to 77.8% in the industrial indicator for production power utilisation in industry  a level highest since May 2001. There was an improvement in the general condition of enterprises in the euro area, particularly in Germany. The main factor galvanizing the general German Improvement industrial condition is  similarly as in Q1 of 2004  foreign demand. A strong export in climate of growth rate in April 2004 was accompanied by a considerable acceleration in industrial general production. A significant increase in the pace of export orders, covering to a great condition in extent investment goods, may indicate a continuation of favourable trends in German euro area industry for the Q2 2004. The average price of Brent oil in May 2004 was 37.9 USD/b and was higher by 14% in comparison with April 2004 and by 47% in comparison with may 2003. This was the highest annual price increase since February 2003. The high level of oil prices was influence foremost by the increased political risk in oil production countries (mainly Iraq and Saudi Arabia), continued low level of oil and benzene supplies and higher than expected increase of demand for oil. At the beginning of June 2004 OPEC decided to raise oil production limits. The impact of this decision on a decrease in the price of oil turned out to be short lasting. High oil Widening war activities in Iraq and increased sabotage attacks on the oil infrastructure prices on of that country interrupted further price decreases. After the first 20 days in June 2004 world the average price of oil amounted to 35.8 USD/b. After the OPEC decision to increase markets production limits the Department of State for Energy lowered somewhat in June 2004 the forecast for the price of oil for 2004 to 34.3 USD/b, thus by 0.4 USD in comparison with the May 2004 forecast. Economic situation in Poland According to GUS published data, the rate of GNP growth in the Q1 of 2004 amounted to 6.9%, in comparison with 4.7% in Q4 of 2003. Domestic demand was decisive in the strong GNP growth rate which exceeded the level of the year before by as much as 5.7%, in comparison with 2.6% in Q4 in 2003. Increased domestic demand resulted from a very high growth rate of accumulation (21.8%, in comparison with 0.9% for Q4 in 2003), which occurred during a moderate revival in expenditures on fixed assets (3.5%) and a surprising strong increase in supplies. In Q1 of 2004 an increase of 3.5% in gross investment expenditures on fixed assets was noted, in comparison with 0.1% for Q4 of 2003. Data from F-01 database indicate that an increase in expenditures in large enterprises was chiefly a result of increased purchases of means of transport, which was undoubtedly influenced by expectations of 4 tax changes as of 1 May 2004. In Q1 of 2004 the growth rate for individual consumption reached a level near that noted in the previous quarter (rate of growth amounted to 4%, in comparison with Higher than 3.9% in Q4 of 2003). The possibility of a stronger acceleration in individual expected consumption suggested a higher turnover in retail trade, significant improvement in GNP growth available household incomes and a low reference point for the previous year. in Q1 of 2004 According to GUS data cumulative consumption increased in Q1 of 2004 by about 0.7%. As a result, the growth rate of consumption a whole amounted to 3.3%, hence as much as in Q4 of 2003. There is as yet no data on export and import growth rate for Q1. One can estimate, however, that the net export input to GNP growth amounted to about 1 point percentage, in comparison with about 2 point percentage in Q4 of 2003. The growth rate in production branches orientated on foreign sales indicates a likely further acceleration in Q1 of export growth rate. One should expect that a decreased participation of net export in GNP growth was caused by a strong increase in import, which is indicated by initial data from the current account. In April 2004 the current account deficit amounted to EUR 610 mln. For the first time in 2004 there was a deepening of the negative current account balance in comparison with the previous year (by EUR 260 mln). This was an influence of the worsening negative balance in the turnover of goods. In April 2004 the foreign trade deficit increased to EUR 1.1 bln (thus it was the highest since December 2000). In comparison with April 2003 the deficit in the turnover of goods deepened by EUR 660 mln. A strong increase in import significantly exceeding export growth contributed to this. The value of import in comparison with April 2003 increased by 36.3%, thus the most since March 1998. Also, an increase in the value of export (by 25%) was higher than the average in the period January  April 2004. However, remaining positions influenced in the direction of improving the current account balance. The increase in the the positive balance of services and transfers was accompanied by a decrease in the earnings deficit. After four months of 2004 the current account deficit amounted to EUR 950 mln and was by 1 bln lower in comparison with the period January  April 2003. All the Improvement positions influenced in the direction of improving the current account balance. The in current strongest  increase in the positive balance of services (by EUR 650 mln) and decrease account in earnings deficit (by EUR 270 mln ). In the following months of 2004 there is, balance however, a decrease in the influence of the improvement in balance of goods on the decrease in the current account deficit. In comparison with the period January  April 2003 the negative balance of foreign trade decreased by barely EUR 10 mln (while in the period January  March 2004 by EUR 70 mln). This results from acceleration of import , whose growth rate atfter four months of 2004 neared that of the export growth rate. I the period January  April 2004 the value of export increased by 21.8%, while import by 19.4% in comparison with the same period in the previous year. According to initial GUS data the annual growth rate of PPI amounted to 12.3% in May 2004, in comparison with 21.8% in April. To a great extent the smaller number of working days had an influence on the decrease in the annual growth rate in industry. The duration of work in May 2004 was shorter by 1 day than a year ago. After seasonal adjustments industrial production increased by about 15%. Decrease in the growth rate of the processing industry (from 25% In April to 14.3 in May) is also connected with the effects observed in the pre-accession months. In conformity with expectations, 5 the strong growth in minerals production industry was not maintained. One can assess, that this decreased industrial production growth as a whole by more than 2 points percentage. There was continued strong growth in mechanical vehicles production. After stabilization of the level of radio and television sets production lasting nearly one year, for a second consecutive month a clear acceleration was noted in the growth rate of this section. However, there was a stronger than expected decrease in the growth production rate of other industries with a large participation in export sales. The jump increase in construction-assembly noted in April was not maintained. Increase in Its level in May was lower than a year ago by 13.4%. This data confirms that the very industrial strong increase in construction-assembly noted in April turned out to be to a large and extent caused by expectations of an increase of VAT on construction materials from construction- 1 May 2004. Most probably in connection with this. April saw the issuing of invoices assembly for a part of the works performed in May, which undervalued the level of construction production production in that year. One can assess that in the period April  May construction  assembly was higher than a year ago by about 4.5%, which indicates a gradual revival growth trend in that branch. GUS studies of the general condition published on 22 June 2004 indicates a further improvement in the general condition of industrial production. An assessment of the general condition climate, after seasonal adjustments, was the highest in the entire period studied, i.e. since 1992. There was also an improvement in the assessment of the general condition climate in construction and trade. According to GUS data for May 2004, in comparison with April 2004 the average salaries in the enterprises sector decreased: nominally by 3.0%, by 4% in real terms. In comparison with May 2003 salaries rose nominally by 5.3% (by 3.1% in real terms), while in the analogous period of 2003 this increase was 1.8% (1.4%). Condition of public finance sector After five months of 2004 the combined state budget revenue was higher than in the analogical period last year by 9.1%, which is a very good result in face of the 1.2% annual increase set in the Budget Law. The high increase in indirect taxes (13.4% year on year), both excise and VAT, had the greatest influence by far on the formation of the state budget revenue in the period of June  May 2004. Especially strong receipts from this title were connected with increased retail sales resulting from increasing domestic demand. Despite a lower tax rate on legal persons in 2004, the receipts from CIT after May 2004 are significantly higher than those of last year (14.8% year on year) and constitute as much as 60% of the annual plan. Such high receipts from CIT result from a favorable settlement of the annual CIT for 2003 and demonstrates an improvement in the corporate financial situation. Non-tax earnings (14.0%) were also significantly higher than in the previous year and were mainly from the title of higher earnings of state governmental units, lump sum EU payments to the state budget for the purpose of improving liquidity and gmina (communes) payments being the consequence of a change in the basis of financing self governing territorial units in 2004. 6 After five months of 2004 the state budget expenditures continued to be nominally lower than the expenditures last year (by 3.5% year on year) in comparison with their planned increase at the level of 5.6% for the entire year. Limitation of state budget expenditures was influenced by lower costs of servicing the domestic debt - by 17.3%, and subsidies for the FUS (Social Security Fund) (14.6%) and FP (Labour Fund) (84.3%). Higher than in the previous year, however, was the cost of servicing the foreign debt (24.6% year on year) and subsidies for FER (3.1%). As a result, the degree of performance of the annual revenue plan of budgetary expenditures, despite making in May 2004 a membership payment to the EU budget, amounted to 38.6% after five months of 2004, which is less than in the previous years. As a result of a favourable earnings situation and low level of budgetary expenditures, the state budget registered at the end of May 2004 a a deficit in the amount of PLN 15.3 bln (33.8% of the annual plan), hence, significantly lower than the amount last year (59.9.% of that planned). In June and July 2004 it can be expected that there will be a worsening of the state Lower than budget situation because of lower budget earnings caused by introduction from 1 May in 2003 2004 of indirect taxation in settlements. advance in There is continued good earnings condition of the FUS. FP. NFZ funds. This is to expenditures a great extent an effect of the growth in salaries and consequently high growth rate of and state premium payments. A continuation of this trend may contribute to a better than planned budget deficit financial situation for this group of public finance sector entities. after four months of The NBP's assessment is that the cash deficit of the public finance sector will be 2004 formed in 2004 at the level of 6.5% of GNP and will be near the size planned by the Minister of Finance. The government accepted Grounds for the Draft Budget Law for 2005 assume a reduction in the state deficit in 2005 to the level of PLN 38.8 bln, i.e. The level of the budget deficit set for the next year is based on the assumption of taking into account savings from the title of the not yet passed by Parliament laws contained in the Programme for Rationalising and Limiting Public Expenditures, i.e. changes to the valorisation principles of retirement-disability benefits and premium payments in the social security system. In face of a low progress made in advancing the Programme and the uncertain political situation, a risk is created of a higher than planned state budget deficit and in effect the deficit of the entire pubic finances sector. Moreover, there is a high probability that in 2004, the public debt will exceed the second prudential threshold (55% of GDP). This will mean that (without changing the debt definition) it will be necessary to drastically adjust fiscal policy in 2006. In light of this threat it is advisable to have a deeper reduction of the public deficit in 2005 than is indicated in the Grounds, through essential limitation of state budget expenditures that do not result in worsening the situation in the remaining segments of public finances. 7 Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate In April 2004, compared with March 2004, money supply increased significantly. The M3 aggregate increased in April by PLN 8.2 bln (2.4 %). The exchange rate differences had major impact on it. After eliminating their influence the M3 increased by PLN 0.7 bln (2.1) which still constitute one of the highest monthly growth for the last two years. The annual nominal growth rate of the M3 aggregate was 8.4 % and it achieved the highest value since December 2001. The observed growth of the M3 aggregate resulted mainly from important increase in deposits and corporate loans as well as commitments to the sector of other non-monetary financial institutions. The deposits and other commitments towards enterprises were still showing an increasing trend which has been observed since the end of the last year. Compared with March 2004 they increased by PLN 6.1 bln (9.3 %). After eliminating the influence of fluctuating exchange rates the increase amounted to PLN 5.9 bln. The annual growth rate of corporate deposits in April was equal 20.9 % - the most since July 2000. Such a significant increase in corporate deposits in April should be connected with an increase in the economic growth rate and also with a quickly increasing value of sales which stemmed from fear of an expected price increase after Poland's EU accession. In April of this year household deposits at banks decreased by PLN 1.4 bln (0.7 %).After removing the influence of exchange rate fluctuations their decrease was even more significant and amounted to PLN 2.4 bln (1.2 %). Negative growth rate of the household deposits slightly increased to -1.6 %. It was not , however, the only result of the exchange rate fluctuations (strong appreciation of gold a year ago in conjunction with major depreciation in April of this year). The level of household savings as an alternative to bank deposits did not significantly change in comparison with March. The state of cash in circulation outside bank tills increased in April 2004 by PLN 1.6 bln (3.1 %). The major growth rate of cash in circulation, at the end of April, just before the long weekend, is a typical phenomenon. The annual growth rate of cash in circulation dropped down to 12 % which is the lowest value since December 2002. Among factors of money supply creation debtors increased nominally by PLN 5.9 bln (2.2 %). After eliminating the influence of fluctuating exchange rates this growth amounted to PLN 4.5 bln (1.7%). Changes in the state of debtors among other things resulted from the significant increase in households indebtedness. In April of this year a significant increase in household bank loans was observed. The household debt increased by PLN 4.3 bln (4.1 %). After removing the Low growth influence of exchange rate fluctuations the real change in the debt amounted to PLN rate for 3.7 bln (3.6 %). The annual nominal growth rate of household loans increased from corporate 13.1 % in March to 18.2 % in April of this year. High growth rate of household debt in loans the Fall of 2003 almost completely stemmed from the increase in housing credits. April data received from banks show also an increase in volume of car loans, furniture purchase and household and RTV equipment. The debt increase to achieve the above mentioned objectives probably stemmed from a fear of price increase after Poland's EU accession. This may be a reason for its isolated character. 8 The April data show continued stagnation in corporate indebtedness in the banking sector. In April bank corporate indebtedness increased nominally from PLN 0.3 bln Drop in bond (0.2 %) which stemmed entirely from the zloty depreciation. After eliminating the prices influence of exchange rate fluctuations the enterprise indebtedness in the banking sector strongest for decreased by PLN 0.4 bln (0.3%). The annual growth rate of corporate indebtedness 2-year bonds increased nominally from  0.5 % in March to 0.8 % in April2004.Such an increase resulted entirely from the exchange rate differences. The loan demand of enterprises may be limited by a significant increase in the availability of their own resources. In the period of 22 April to 21 May 2004 the zloty strengthened against the euro by 2% and 3.9% against the dollar (from the beginning of the year the EUR/PLN exchange rarte has strengthened somewhat while USD/PLN rose by 4.2%). In the last twelve months the zloty weakened against the euro by 7.5% and 5.9% against the dollar. Uncertainties resulting from political risk and existing dangers for the continuation of indispensable public finances reforms is the cause of the continuation of a long-term depreciation trend for the zloty. In May, fluctuations of the zloty resulted from a changing market assessment as to the chances of calling a government of Premier Belka and the publication of macroeconomic data for April. A downward trend continued on treasury bonds market. From the last meeting of the MPC benchmark bond prices decreased. As a result the yield on 2-year, 5-year and 10-year bonds increased in this period by 53, 26 and 28 b.p. respectively (from the beginning of the year this change was 128, 107 and 86 b.p. respectively). This trend was influence to a greatest extent by factors of a domestic character, which is demonstrated by an increase in yield variability of 2-, 5-, and 10-year bonds in respect of an analogical eurobond area. Confirmation of a continued high investment Significant risk is the lowering of Poland's long-term rating in domestic currency by Fitch Ratings. growth in Similarly, as in April, the high growth rate of industrial production strengthened PPI indicator expectations of a rates hike. Because of this, 2-year bonds, which are most sensitive to rates changes by the central bank, lost the most on their value. Prices, inflationary expectations In April 2004 the annual CPI was 2.2% (1.7% in March). In comparison with April 2003, the highest increases in prices were in foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages (4.6%), prices for apartment usage and power carriers (3.0%) prices in transport (3.5%), including cost of fuels (4.7%). Lower than in April 2003 were prices of clothing and footwear. In April 2004 there was an increase in the base inflation indicators from 1.2% (net inflation) on an annual basis to 2.3% (base inflation indicator after excluding controlled prices). The PPI increased in April 2004 significantly above market expectations and amounted to 7.5% on an annual basis, and at the same time was set at the highest level since October 2000. NBP analysis show that up to February 2004 the price producer price increases were a result chiefly of prices obtained in export. The index of domestic prices 9 remained stable and amounted to about 2% on an annual basis. In March and April 2004 there was a change and the producer prices in the processing industry section were stimulated by domestic prices. This is chiefly connected with price increases in the following divisions: production of coke and oil refinery - where in that division the earnings from export sales amounted in 2003 to 6.3% - and metals production. After excluding these two divisions from the processing industry section the April prices would have increased by about 0.6% in comparison with March, hence, on the level of January and February. An increase in the PPI in the section of processing industry have to a great extent a supply character resulting from the increase in oil and metals prices on world markets. In divisions less dependent on raw material significantly smaller price increase are noted. The inflation rate expectations of individuals in May 2004 , within the next 12 months, amounts to 2.4% (by 0.1 point percentage more than in the previous month). Bank analysts forecast that in December 2004 the inflation rate will be 3.0% (an increase of 0.4 point percentage), in April 2005 at 2.9% (no change), while the average annual rate of inflation in 2005 at 2.9% (increase of 0.1 point percentage)."
United States,2004-06-30,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1-1/4 percent. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid pace and labor market conditions have improved. Although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal. With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.

Euroarea,2004-07-01,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. On the basis of the regular economic and monetary analyses, we have confirmed our assessment of last month. While somewhat stronger inflationary pressure is likely to persist over the short term, the outlook still remains in line with price stability over the medium term. Therefore, the Governing Council decided to retain its monetary policy stance, leaving the key ECB interest rates unchanged. By historical standards, interest rates are low, both in nominal and in real terms, also lending support to economic activity. The Governing Council will remain vigilant with regard to all developments which could affect the risks to price stability over the medium term. Let me now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. Following quarterly real GDP growth of 0.6% in the first quarter of this year, the latest data releases confirm that the economic recovery in the euro area is continuing. All in all, the latest indicators of output and expenditure, as well as the most recent survey data, remain consistent with ongoing growth in real activity during the second quarter. Looking ahead, we remain confident that the recovery of economic activity will continue. The conditions for a broadening and strengthening of the recovery are in place. On the external side, economic growth outside the euro area remains strong, which should promote euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment should benefit from the positive external environment and the favourable financing conditions within the euro area. As corporate restructuring gathers pace and business efficiency advances, the resulting improvements in profits should further underpin business investment. Moreover, the recovery of private consumption should proceed in line with increases in real disposable income and the anticipated subsequent strengthening of employment growth. Available forecasts from international and private organisations paint a broadly similar picture of the outlook for the euro area. The expectation of a continued economic recovery is also in line with recent developments in financial markets. Of course, this scenario of an ongoing economic recovery may be influenced by a number of factors working in opposite directions. On the upside, euro area growth in the first quarter was stronger than anticipated and this momentum may strengthen shorter-term dynamics. Ongoing robust growth in the global economy could also lead to stronger than expected activity in the euro area. On the downside, despite having declined somewhat, oil prices remain at high levels and may, largely through their impact on the euro area's terms of trade, dampen growth. Furthermore, over longer horizons, there are concerns relating to the persistence of global imbalances. Turning to price developments, there is a need to distinguish between short-term developments and the medium-term trend when assessing risks to price stability. Over the short term, oil prices continue to exert upward pressure on the general price level. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.4% in June, having stood at 2.5% in May. Although oil prices have fallen over the last weeks, markets expect them to remain high for some time. Were this to occur, inflation rates would most likely remain above 2% for longer than previously expected. Looking beyond the short term, however, the outlook remains consistent with price stability, provided that wages develop moderately, in line with the latest evidence available. The strength of global economic dynamism may continue to exert upward pressure on commodity prices, including oil prices. Moreover, following rather strong increases in the past, the further evolution of indirect taxes and administered prices is difficult to incorporate into any forward-looking assessment at this point in time, because such information usually becomes available only later in the year. Against this background, the potential risk of second-round effects via wage and pricing behaviour needs to be monitored closely. Social partners can make an important contribution to facilitating the maintenance of price stability by focusing on the medium-term outlook for price developments rather than on currently observed rates of inflation. Finally, measures of long-term inflation expectations derived from financial market indicators remain relatively high. While these indicators should be interpreted with caution, their development calls for particular vigilance. Moving to the monetary analysis, the overall picture remains unchanged from our previous assessment. While this decline partly reflects base effects, the portfolio decisions of firms and households are also returning to normal as financial uncertainties have receded. Indeed, there are signs that savings are increasingly being allocated to long-term assets outside M3 rather than to liquid monetary assets. However, despite the recent moderation of annual M3 growth, there remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth. While a significant part of the excess liquidity has accumulated as a result of past portfolio shifts, low interest rates have also fuelled the build-up of liquid assets. The stock of excess liquidity, if it persists, may pose an upside risk to price stability over the medium term. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that the medium-term outlook for price developments remains in line with price stability, while ongoing close monitoring is necessary. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports this conclusion, including the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of upside risks to price stability. The Governing Council also discussed a number of issues relating to economic policies in the euro area. First, as regards fiscal policies, it is now of the highest priority that all countries concerned re-establish their commitment to consolidation in order to avoid past mistakes of unbalanced policies in a recovery period. Indeed, the recovery offers the opportunity to put public finances on a sounder track. This requires a strict control of expenditure in the implementation of this year's budget and a comprehensive reform strategy as a basis for next year's fiscal planning. Credible expenditure-based reforms are needed to sustain budgetary consolidation and promote the soundness of social security systems, thereby strengthening confidence in the short term and economic growth prospects in the medium term. Maintaining the existing institutional framework and implementing it consistently is essential to safeguard the soundness of public finances and the macroeconomic environment. In the view of the Governing Council, the Stability and Growth Pact should not be changed, even though its implementation within the current framework could be improved further. A second issue we have discussed in depth over recent weeks has been the need to clearly step up the pace of structural reforms in the labour and product markets. In this connection, the Governing Council expressed concern about growth in euro area labour productivity having been on a downward trend since the mid-1990s. While this partly reflects improvements in employment, it is also the consequence of sub-optimal progress in fostering overall economic efficiency. Reaping the benefits of the technological advances and efficiency gains associated with producing and using new information and communication technologies requires, in particular, the removal of structural rigidities. In this respect, stimulating further product market competition, particularly in the services sectors, and facilitating industrial restructuring could speed up innovation and the adoption of the new technologies. At the same time, strengthening and spreading technological advances across the individual sectors of the euro area economy must go hand in hand with increased efforts to enhance human capital and adjust educational systems to the changing needs of the labour market. Since the mid-1990s, somewhat stronger average employment growth has partly compensated for the negative impact of lower productivity gains on overall output growth. However, despite past improvements in employment, the labour supply and its utilisation in the euro area remain low on international comparison. A relatively smaller proportion of the working-age population participates in the labour market, a higher proportion of those participating is unemployed and those who are employed work, on average, far fewer hours per year than elsewhere. Hence, there is a need for further policy changes in the euro area that underpin the labour supply and its utilisation and thereby raise the medium-term growth prospects, so as to preserve average living standards in the face of an ageing population."
Peru,2004-07-01,"Press Release BOARD OF THE CENTRAL BANK APPROVED MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2004 REFERENCE INTEREST RATE IS KEPT AT 2,50% In June the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.56 percent, due mainly to the increase in the prices of some foods. Core inflation was 0.22 percent. Cumulative inflation through last 12 month reached 4.26 percent, higher than in May (3.18 percent), since June 2003 inflation was negative in 0.47 percent. However, core inflation, an indicator of the inflationary trend was 2.73 percent over last 12 months. In 2004. inflation would be transitorily above the upper limit of the target range due to supply shocks in foods and fuels during the first semester. The Central Bank will pay special attention to the inflationary pressures over the next months in order to take the preventive measures to meet the inflation target. Inflation for 2004 and 2005 is expected to fall within the target range (1.5-3.5 percent). The average interbank interest rate was 2.46 percent in June, slightly lower than in May (2.48 percent). For July, the Board of the Central Bank decided to maintain the reference interest rates for monetary operations off auction: 3.25 percent: for direct repos and monetary regulation credits 1.75 percent: for overnight deposits. The monetary operations regarding injection or withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be made in order to place the interbank interest rate in the center of this corridor of reference interest rates (2,50 percent). In case the market interbank interest rate be higher than 3.25 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. For July, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCRP is 170  190 million. This balance is neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it is also affected by seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes. The interest rates for Central Bank‘s operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP's deposits held abroad Swaps, the commission that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.25 percent is maintained August Monetary Program will be approved in the Board of Directors meeting of August 5, 2004."
Chile,2004-07-08,"The Central Bank of Chile Press Release* Santiago, 8 July 2004 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 1.75% (annual). Since the previous meeting, data shows an increase in annual CPI inflation, while projections point to a gradual convergence to 3% over the usual 24-month policy horizon, in line with the baseline scenario considered in the last Monetary Policy Report. Second-quarter output and domestic expenditure growth has strengthened. Although the latest indicators for investment and foreign trade have been more dynamic and the labor market has been weaker than expected, these developments are not sufficient to warrant a modification of growth and inflation prospects for the coming quarters. The Central Bank will be alert to timely adjust its monetary policy against deviations of projected inflation from the specified target range."

Nigeria,2004-07-20,"PRESS RELEASE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA. COMMUNIQUE NO. 37 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE IN JULY, 2004 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at the end of its 184th meeting in July 2004, decided to keep unchanged the recent recall of public sector funds lodged with the deposit money banks. It would be recalled that at the end of its previous meeting, the MPC approved the withdrawal of public sector deposits amounting to N745 billion from the banks to the CBN. This represents 756 per cent of total public sector deposits and from only four parastatals. It would also be recalled that the temporary withdrawal of public sector deposits is part of the liquidity management instruments of the CBN, stated in its Monetary. Credit. Foreign Trade and Exchange Policy Guidelines for fiscal 2004/2005. This would help to sustain the tightening of monetary policy stance agreed to in the previous meeting, in order to stem the rising inflationary pressure and the high demand for foreign exchange. Available information since the last meeting indicated that the pressure on prices has continued. The daily average demand for foreign exchange dropped, but remained unsustainably high. The gross official external reserve increased and the naira exchange rate appreciated in the Dutch Auction System (DAS) segment of the market, owing to the increased supply of foreign exchange by the CBN. The exchange rate depreciated in the Bureaux de Change (BDC) market, thereby widening the spread between the DAS and the BDC exchange rates. The Committee also observed that the growth in monetary aggregates remained within the programme targets, as bank credit to the Federal Government continued to fall. Nevertheless it recognized the threat to monetary stability posed by the anticipated bunched government spending on capital projects in the rest of the year. It also noted the risk of further pressure on prices if the monetary policy stance should be relaxed so soon. In this regard, the Committee agreed to sustain the phased recall of public sector funds with the deposit money banks until further notice. James K Olekah Secretary. Monetary Policy Committee.

Thailand,2004-07-21,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 21 July 2004 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. The MPC viewed that the Thai economy continued to expand, driven by domestic spending and exports, in particular private investment and accommodative monetary policy. With the economic expansion, rising oil and farm prices, headline inflation rose to 3 per cent year-on-year in June 2004. Core inflation, however, remained low at 05 per cent. Going forward, the MPC assessed that the tightening labour market and continued economic expansion would exert pressure on core inflation. During the economic up-cycle, in addition to taking care of inflationary pressure, the main objective of monetary policy, the MPC considered it important to monitor indicators of potential financial imbalances. Currently the MPC deemed the imbalances in the real estate sector and household debts to be of particular concerns. The MPC considered both internal and external risks which could affect Thai economy growth going forward. Domestic risks included unrest in southern Thailand and the re-emergence of the avain flu which would affect consumer and investor confidence. External risks included the upward trend in foreign interest rates and rising oil prices. Looking ahead, the MPC viewed that there would be less need for an accommodative monetary policy than at present. The MPC would stand ready to respond once inflation showed a clearer sign of acceleration or the buildup of financial imbalances became more apparent. Given the aforementioned uncertainty of risks, the MPC decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 125 per cent per annum for the time being."

Philippines,2004-07-28,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The decision to keep rates unchanged was based on the Monetary Board's assessment that the prevailing outlook for future inflation and output growth continues to support the argument for maintaining present monetary settings. In particular, the BSP's latest outlook for inflation shows higher forecasts for inflation in 2004-2005 but the projected uptrend will be driven mainly by pressures from temporary supply-side factors, which cannot be addressed directly by monetary policy. Monetary tightening restrains inflation pressures primarily by curbing aggregate demand, and the direct impact on consumer goods of supply-side factors, such as movements in world oil prices, is on production costs rather than on demand. The Monetary Board is of the view, therefore, that the expected uptrend in inflation is temporary and would not require monetary action. On the other hand, the application of non-monetary government measures, such as those enabling timely importation, may help ease the ongoing supply pressures on certain consumption goods. At the same time, experience with past episodes of supply-side inflation pressures also shows that headline inflation tends to quickly revert to its long-term trend after a brief upsurge. For example, past transport fare increases stemming from oil price increases have led mainly to short-lived surges in headline inflation. Equally important, the overall conditions for aggregate demand, credit activity and investments suggest against monetary tightening which could have a contractionary impact on the economy. Nevertheless. BSP forecasts indicate that annual inflation is likely to track the upper end of the 4-5 percent target for 2004 and briefly exceed the inflation target in 2005, before decelerating to between 4-5 percent in 2006. In the event that the 2005 target is exceeded as confirmed by the release of official NSO data in January 2006, the BSP will issue an open letter to the public outlining the reasons behind the deviation of actual inflation from the target, what monetary authorities did in response to the deviation, and why they chose to respond in such a fashion. The framework of inflation targeting allows sufficient flexibility for monetary authorities to deal with unforeseen developments or shocks to prices. Equally important, it also recognizes the limits of the effectiveness of monetary policy by providing for a clear definition of the acceptable circumstances under which an inflation-targeting central bank may fail to achieve its inflation target. These circumstances include: (a) movements in prices of agricultural products, (b) natural calamities; (c) movements in international oil prices, and (d) changes in government administrative measures. The Monetary Board wishes to emphasize that the BSP remains firmly committed to delivering stable prices, and will therefore continue to monitor the development of second-round effects from supply-side pressures so as to assess the need for policy rate action in the future. In addition, given the dominant role of supply-side developments in the inflation outlook, the BSP has made representations with relevant agencies of government on the importance of pursuing policy measures directly aimed at addressing price pressures emanating from the supply-side."
Poland,2004-07-28,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 28 July 2004 INFORMATION FROM A MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 27-28 July 2004 The annual inflation rate rose in June 2004 to 4.4%, significantly surpassing the upper limit of the MPC accepted deviations from the inflationary target. A high growth level of the PPI indicator (9.2%) was maintained. There were also strong increases in all measurements of the inflation base rate from a level of 2.0% - 3.7% in May 2004 to 2.3% - 4.5% in June 2004. The acceleration of inflation was foremost a result of the increase in the price of fuel and foodstuffs, an increase in tax rates for indirect taxation and other factors connected with Poland's EU entry, including an increase in the demand for Polish foodstuffs. An increase in all the inflation measurements in the last few months is accompanied by a significant increase in household inflationary expectations, of entrepreneurs and traders. It is especially worrisome that there is a strong increase in household inflationary expectations which occurred even before the publication of inflation data for June 2004. The data on economic activity in June confirms a high economic growth rate. The Central Statistical Office (GUS) study of the July general condition indicate that there is an increase of optimism in industry and construction, large enterprises and exporters are signalling investment increases. Also. July 2004 NBP analyses of the general condition of enterprises confirm a growing trend in investment activity. Moreover, for the first time since 1998, the percentage of enterprises planning an increase in employment exceeded the percentage of entities intending to make reductions. There has also been the appearance of signs evidencing plans for greater foreign direct investments in Poland, which together with the start of funding from EU structural funds and the Cohesion Fund should contribute to the maintenance of a high economic growth rate. A significant growth in inflationary expectations together with an increasing likelihood of maintaining high economic growth increases the risk of persistent higher inflation. The salaries growth rate in the economy will be a significant factor in the formation of future inflation. Even though up to now an increase in salaries remained at a moderate level, there is an appearance of signs evidencing an increase in salaries demand, which may lead in future to higher salary increases. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (22) 826 99 55, fax (22) 826 37 51. Endeavouring that the increased inflation above the upper limit of permissible deviations from the inflationary target has a transitory character and that, after the expiry of transitory factors, inflation should return to a level that is in conformity with the inflationary target of the MPC (2.5%), the Council has decided to raise the NBP rates by 0.25 percentage point to the level of: ● reference rate 6.0% on an annual basis; ● lombard rate 7.5% on an annual basis; ● deposit rate 4.5% on an annual basis; ● rediscount rate 6.5% on an annual basis. The Council maintains its restrictive monetary policy stance. The resolutions of the MPC come into force as of 29 July 2004. I. Factors favouring a low inflation rate: Τhere was a lower credit growth rate for enterprises; its annual growth rate in June 2004 was  2.8% as against 2.3% in May 2004. Credit demand of enterprises may be limited by the high level of their own financial resources at their disposal; enterprises increased in June 2004 the level of their deposits within the banking system by nearly PLN 4 bn. High increase in labour efficiency is maintained; in June 2004 it rose in industry as a whole on an annual basis by 15.9% (12.8% in May 2004) and in industrial processing by 17.2% (by 14% in May 2004). High level of unemployment is maintained, which in light of the latest data continues to limit the growth rate in salaries. There has been a significant strengthening of the zloty exchange rate in the last two months, which as long as it becomes persistent will have an effect in the direction of limiting inflation. II. Factors giving rise to the risk of inflation growth: From the beginning of this year there is an increase in household inflationary expectations. Inflation rate expectations of individuals within the next 12 months, despite an improvement in the structure of expectations, rose in July 2004 to 4%, i.e. by 1.3 percentage point more than in June 2004 due to an increase in the current inflation rate. There was a substantial increase in the uncertainty of bank analysts across all horizon measurements. The inflation forecast for the next 11 months increased by 0.1 percentage point (2.8%), the average annual inflation forecast in 2005 increased by 0.4 percentage point (3.2%), while the strongest increases were in the short-term forecasts  analysts forecast that the annual inflation rate at the end of 2004 will amount to 4.0%, i.e. by 1 percentage point more than in the previous month. Both surveys were conducted at a time when the level of inflation for June 2004 was still unknown. -2 - As well. NBP analyses of enterprises for a second quarter show that they are significantly increasing their expectations of price increases in the economy (CPI and PPI); in the course of Q2 the CPI indicator forecast rose by 0.7 percentage point. There are also further price increase expectations in retail trade. In GUS studies traders are signalling further goods price increases, including further foodstuff price increases. Producer price inflation amounted to 9.2% in June 2004 on an annual basis as against 9.6% in May 2004. Producer prices from the beginning of the year are formed chiefly under the influence of oil and metals prices. Inflation is increasing on producer prices for domestic sales. June 2004 was a further month of a high growth rate in sold industrial output. Industrial production as a whole rose by 15.7% on an annual basis, while for the processing industry by 17.8%. This confirms persistent economic growth. Maintenance of a growth trend in the economy is also indicated in the GUS July survey of the general condition. There was improvement in the assessment of the general condition in the processing industry in comparison with the previous month and taking into account seasonal fluctuations it was the highest in the entire period studied, i.e. from 1992. There was also an improvement in the assessment of the general condition in construction. NBP analyses indicate that in Q3 of 2004 the growth rate will be somewhat slower than in Q2 but the general condition will still be maintained at a high level. Large enterprises and exporters are signalling an increase in investment, while entrepreneurs offering their products and services exclusively domestically are expecting further increase in new orders. An impulse for investments, but also increasing inflationary pressure, may become the continually growing level of production capacity utilisation, which at the end of Q2 achieved 80.7%, the highest level in the history of polled studies. According to initial NBP estimates the increase in the 2004 Q2 GNP will amount to about 6.0%. Monetary policy is conducted together with a loose fiscal policy and with a lack of clear perspectives as to the scale of reforms, which would lead to a recovery of public finances and a future limitation of the public deficit. High oil prices are maintained, while the forecast prices of this raw material have again been raised. The current forecasts of the annual average oil price in 2004 were increased by 0.6 USD/b in comparison with the June 2004 forecast. From September 2003 to July 2004 the forecast prices increased from 26.0 USD/b to 34.9 USD/b. Foodstuff prices rose in June 2004 by 2.7%, while inflation for foodstuffs amounted to 8.1% on an annual basis. In the first half of July 2004 the price of foodstuffs did not change in comparison with the first half of June 2004. It is assessed that the seasonal drop in prices will be limited because of a renewed and maintained foreign demand for Polish foodstuff products. The next meeting of the Council will take place on 24-25 August 2004."
Peru,2004-08-05,"Press Release BOARD OF THE CENTRAL BANK APPROVED MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2004 CENTRAL BANK RAISES REFERENCE INTEREST RATE TO 2.75% In July, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.19 percent (2.3 percent in annual basis), due mainly to the price increases in fuel and transportation. The cumulative inflation in the January-July period was 3.2 percent. Thus, 12-month inflation reached 4.6 percent, higher than in June (4.3 percent). Core inflation, indicator of the inflationary trend, was 2.7 percent over last 12 months. Import goods price index rose by 11.0 percent in similar period. As mentioned in May Inflation Report, the rate of inflation is transitorily above the upper bound of the range due to consecutive supply shocks over the first half of the year (foodstuffs and fuel). In this regard, the Central Bank is taking actions so inflation would converge to its target. The Central Bank forecasts that the 12-month cumulative inflation would decrease over the next months near to the upper bound of the target range (1.5-3.5 percent) for 2004 and around the mid-point of the range (2.5 percent) for 2005. The Board of the Central Bank raised in 25 basis points the reference interest rates of the monetary operations: The monetary operations regarding injection or withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be made in order to place the interbank interest rate around the center of the corridor set by the reference interest rates (2.75 percent). Since November 2003 this reference rate was 2.5 percent. For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate went up from 3.25 to 3.5 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate went up from 1.75 to 2.0 percent. In case of the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.5 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. For August, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCR is 165 - 185 million. This balance is neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it is also affected by seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes. The interest rates for Central Bank‘s operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCR's deposits held abroad Swaps: the commission is raised to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.5 percent. September Monetary program will be approved in the Board of Directors meeting of September 9, 2004."
Romania,2004-08-06,"The National Bank of Romania Board has decided in its meeting of 5 August, after having reviewed macroeconomic developments, to lower the policy rate by 0.75 of a percentage point, to reflect the continuing disinflation. The National Bank of Romania will maintain the prudent monetary policy stance to ensure that macroeconomic equilibria remain in place. The National Bank of Romania Board has also decided to increase to 30 percent the required reserve ratio on deposits in foreign exchange, in order to spur financial intermediation in domestic currency, and to secure an effective risk management of credit institutions."
United States,2004-08-10,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1-1/2 percent. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. In recent months, output growth has moderated and the pace of improvement in labor market conditions has slowed. This softness likely owes importantly to the substantial rise in energy prices. The economy nevertheless appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion going forward. Inflation has been somewhat elevated this year, though a portion of the rise in prices seems to reflect transitory factors. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal. With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Thomas M Hoenig; Donald L Kohn; Cathy E Minehan; Mark W Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 2-1/2 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston. New York. Philadelphia. Cleveland. Richmond. Atlanta. Chicago.

Chile,2004-08-12,"The Central Bank of Chile Press Release* Santiago, 12 August 2004 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 1.75% (annual). The incidence of the increase in fuel prices will probably push CPI inflation toward 3% before forecast in the latest Monetary Policy Report. However, core inflation measures CPIX and CPIX1 (which exclude some goods with more volatile prices) are converging to target range of 2% to 4% at the expected pace. Good economic activity indicators reinforce the scenario of gradual narrowing of the output gap. In particular, foreign trade and investment figures continued to exceed growth expectations. In addition, recent news from the labor market suggests that the weak performance of the last two months has improved to some extent. Against this background, the Board believes that the moment is approaching when it will be necessary to reduce the marked monetary impulse, in order to make compatible the strengthened economy with an expected annual inflation rate of 3% over the usual policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. At any rate, it reiterates that it will be alert to make timely adjustments to monetary policy in order to confront any deviations of expected inflation from the specified target range. In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2004-08-12,"The bank of korea. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower its target for the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) from 3.75 percent to 3.5 percent for the inter-meeting period. In a related action, the Committee lowered the interest rates on Liquidity Adjustment Loans and Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans of the Bank of Korea by the same 25 basis points, respectively to 3.25 percent and 2.25 percent.

South Africa,2004-08-12,"The inflation outcome during the first six months of 2004 was more favourable than had been thought to be the case at the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. The actual year-on-year increases in the consumer price index in metropolitan and other urban areas when mortgage cost is excluded (CPIX) was much better than forecast. The lower base, combined with the recent rise in the value of the rand, has resulted in a lower projection for CPIX inflation in the next two years. Although CPIX inflation is still expected to rise over the forecast period, it will probably not breach the upper 6 per cent level of the target range, as previously concluded, provided that the assumptions made in the projection are not too wide off the mark. These results are expected to be achieved in combination with robust growth rates in domestic production as well as demand. The twelve-month rate of increase in the CPIX rose from 4,0 per cent in December 2003 to 4,8 per cent in February 2004, before slowing down to 4,4 per cent in March and remaining at that level in the next two months. In June 2004 CPIX inflation rose to 5,0 per cent mainly due to increases in petrol and diesel prices. This was probably a temporary spike in CPIX inflation because the prices of petrol and diesel were reduced in the next two months. If changes in petrol and diesel prices are excluded from the CPIX, the year-on-year rate of increase in the prices of other consumer goods and services continued to slow down from 4,9 per cent in February 2004 to 4,0 per cent in June. CPIX inflation has now been within the inflation target range for a period of ten consecutive months. Measured from quarter to quarter at seasonally adjusted and annualised rates. CPIX inflation declined from 7,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2004 to 5,2 per cent in the second quarter. The deceleration in CPIX inflation was discernible in most of the main categories of consumer goods and services and the prices of certain products actually declined, such as those of clothing and footwear, food and soft drinks, and of new and used vehicles. In contrast to these developments, the running cost of vehicles, and the prices of water, education and alcoholic drinks and tobacco rose at quarterly annualised rates in excess of 10 per cent. The rates of increase over twelve months in the prices of these goods and services and in the cost of medical services were also still well above the upper limit of the inflation target range. These high increases were largely due to changes in administered prices and indirect taxes. However, recent announcements by the government indicate a greater determination to moderate increases in administered prices as part of the co-ordination of policies to achieve the objective of price stability. The all-goods production price index declined in the second half of 2003 to a lower level in January 2004 owing to a decline in the prices of imported goods and relatively low rates of increase in the prices of domestically produced goods. From February 2004 this index started to move upwards, with the result that the all-goods production price inflation measured over twelve months became positive in May and amounted to 1,3 per cent in June. The quarter-to-quarter rate of increase in production prices, seasonally adjusted and annualised, rose from 0,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2004 to 4,7 per cent in the second quarter. These recent increases in production prices are consistent with the expected rise in consumer prices in the coming months since consumer prices normally react to changes in the prices charged by producers with a time lag. The favourable inflation outcome was at first achieved with slower growth in the domestic economy. Growth in real gross domestic product deteriorated in 2003 and averaged only 2 per cent for the year as a whole. Production volumes were affected by a hesitant global economic recovery, a deterioration in the international price competitiveness of domestic manufacturers and a decline in agricultural output. In the latter part of 2003 growth started to gather momentum and in the first quarter of 2004 amounted to a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 3 per cent in reaction to a more accommodative monetary and fiscal policy stance, stronger global growth and increased business and consumer confidence. Data, such as manufacturing and mining output, wholesale and retail trade volumes and the number of new vehicles sold, indicate that the economy continued to grow briskly in the second quarter of the year. As already indicated, the inflation outlook is generally promising and CPIX inflation is expected to stay within the inflation target range over the next two years, but it could move close to the upper boundary of the target range in the second half of 2005. One of the main factors responsible for the recent and expected future low inflation is the decline in import prices, brought about by the further rise in the external value of the rand and low global inflation. Import price inflation, measured over periods of twelve months, has been negative since April 2003, or for a period of fifteen months. South African import prices will be influenced, in the first instance, by global inflation. As could be expected with the significant increase that has been experienced in international commodity prices since the beginning of 2002, consumer price inflation has started to rise in most of the major industrialised economies. For example, year-on-year core inflation in the United States of America increased from 1,1 per cent in January 2004 to 1,9 per cent in June, and the corresponding rate of increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices in the euro area rose from 1,6 per cent in February 2004 to 2,4 per cent in June. These increases are, however, coming from low levels. A marked acceleration in global inflation to high levels is not foreseen, particularly because of the continued strong productivity growth in some of these countries combined with a tightening in the monetary policy stance. Import price inflation is also dependent, in the second instance, on the external value of the rand. Having recovered during 2002 and 2003 from the sharp fall in the latter part of 2001, the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand increased by a further 9 per cent until the end of July 2004. This sharp rise in the average exchange rate of the rand has distorted the planning of many enterprises in the country and has had a serious negative impact on international price competitiveness with the resultant stress being witnessed in the export earnings of manufacturing and mining companies. At the same time, the exchange rate of the rand has also contributed to lower imported inflation and, looking forward, to a lower prospective profile of CPIX inflation within the target range. Currency markets are unpredictable and so is the future performance of the exchange rate of the rand, which is , amongst other things subject to balance of payments developments. South Africa's international trade balance has declined from a surplus at a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of about R30 billion in the second quarter of 2003 to nearly R15 billion in the first quarter of 2004 and a deficit of R5,5 billion in the second quarter. However, if special factors affecting the trade balance are excluded, such as purchases of commercial aircraft and military equipment, the trade balance has remained broadly unchanged over the past three quarters. Moreover, the turnaround to a negative overall trade balance did not affect the exchange rate of the rand because it was easily financed by an inflow of capital. The future external value of the rand might depend to a large extent on the behaviour of these financial inflows. Concern about the influence of another exogenous factor, food prices, has dissipated somewhat. At the beginning of 2004 the Monetary Policy Committee noted the severe drought in many parts of the country, combined with the rise in global food prices. Widespread rains in the summer-rainfall area led to upward revisions of crop estimates, and shortages of maize and other grains should not negatively affect agricultural prices. Despite the heavy rains in the winter-rainfall areas, evidence suggests that some parts are still in the grip of a drought. The recent reversal in global food prices should alleviate pressures that could arise from poor agricultural conditions. An important positive development on the inflation front has been the declining trend of inflation expectations in the country. This is clearly illustrated by the Survey of Inflation Expectations of The Bureau for Economic Research at the University of Stellenbosch undertaken on behalf of the Reserve Bank in the second quarter of 2004. According to this survey. CPIX inflation expectations have declined continuously. In contrast to this, the break-even inflation rate calculated as the difference between the nominal yield on government bonds and the real yield on inflation-linked bonds within the five-to-nine year maturity range, has increased in 2004. This approximation of long-term inflation rose from a low of 4,8 per cent in December 2003 to 6,1 per cent in May 2004, before declining to 5,6 per cent recently in July. A number of other factors support a positive inflation outlook. These include the low levels of utilisation of manufacturing production capacity, continued fiscal prudence and more restraint in administered price increases. In addition, the twelve-month growth in total loans and advances extended by banks to the domestic private sector declined from a peak of 12,6 per cent in February 2004 to 8,9 per cent in June. However, part of this lower growth is due to disintermediation as the corporate sector is funding capital outlays and other expenditure to an increasing extent outside the banking sector. The most important risks over the short term to this positive inflation outlook are probably global imbalances, exchange rate movements and increases in international oil prices. In particular the rise in oil prices presents a major threat to inflation over the short term. Brent crude oil prices have increased from levels of around US$24 per barrel in May 2003 to almost US$40 per barrel in May 2004. This rise in international oil prices reflected mainly ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and a strong demand for oil in the United States and China. Although oil prices declined somewhat in June 2004 to levels of around US$34 per barrel when the OPEC countries stated that they would increase production, this did not last long and at present oil prices are fluctuating around levels of US$42 per barrel. Such high prices will not only have an impact on inflation, but could also neutralise to some extent the recent improvements in the global economy as well as South Africa's terms of trade and growth. Over the longer term, the current growth in nominal unit labour cost could be a significant threat to low inflation as well. This growth in nominal unit labour cost rose from an average of 5,0 per cent in 2003 to a year-on-year rate of 5,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2004. Another development which could have an impact on inflation over the long term is the higher rate of increase in domestic demand reflecting the reduction in interest rates, rising real disposable income and the higher priority assigned to infrastructural development. National accounts statistics are not yet available for the second quarter of 2004, but available indicators, such as retail sales, signal that domestic demand continued to increase rapidly in this quarter. Growth in the money supply also remained relatively brisk, while the income velocity of circulation reached historically low levels in the first half of 2004. The twelve-month growth rate in the broadly-defined money supply (M3) increased from 12,3 per cent in December 2003 to 14,9 per cent in February 2004, before declining to 12,1 per cent in June. Moreover, it was mainly the growth in the transaction demand for money that was responsible for the high rates of increase in M3 during the first half of 2004. Against this background, the Monetary Policy Committee took note of the moderate improvement in the outlook for inflation noted above, and came to the conclusion that it would be appropriate and prudent to lower the repo rate by 50 basis points to 7,5 per cent per annum with effect from Friday 13th of August 2004. The Committee will continue to monitor the various factors that impact on inflation and will accordingly make any future decisions based on the inflation outlook."
Philippines,2004-08-22,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The decision to maintain the BSP's key policy rates was based on the Monetary Board's assessment that the inflation outlook remains driven by supply-side pressures, particularly the continued rise in fuel prices and selected food items. The Monetary Board noted that the inflation pattern is consistent with past episodes of supply-side pressures, highlighting the point that said price pressures are temporary in nature with no permanent long-run impact on the overall inflation path over the medium term. The Monetary Board, thus, held the view that any monetary policy action would not be appropriate in addressing supply-side constraints. At the same time, the lack of a broad-based upsurge in demand conditions as evidenced by the modest improvements in credit activity and investments along with the high rate of unemployment argue against an increase in the BSP's policy rates which could have a dampening impact on economic activity. Given this analysis of the inflation dynamics and the continuing increase in world oil prices, the BSP forecasts that actual inflation may exceed the targets for 2004 and 2005. Inflation can be mitigated by appropriate supply-side measures such as those that would facilitate timely importation, distribution and delivery of certain commodities. These include the finalization of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA) extending the duty-free importation of farm and fishery inputs and equipment; setting up of food lanes and truck routes; intensification of the monitoring of commodity prices; exploration of alternative packaging technologies. In 2006, inflation is expected to decelerate to the 4-5 percent range. The Monetary Board emphasized that the BSP remains firmly committed to delivering stable prices. In particular, the BSP will continue to monitor the developments of second round effects emanating from supply-side pressures which may require a measured monetary policy response in the future. This is consistent with the need to exercise caution in the efforts to rein in any further build up of inflation inertia while maintaining the flexibility to promote economic growth."
Israel,2004-08-23,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for September 2004. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for September 2004, according to which the Bank's interest rate will remain at the level of 4.1 percent, following cumulative reductions of 5 percent between the end of 2002 and April 2004. The Bank explains that its decision not to change the rate, for the fifth consecutive month, is based on the fact that assessments concerningthe development of inflation for a period of one to two years ahead, from market-derived inflation expectations and various forecasts of private forecasters, are consistent with the inflation target, 1% to 3% peryear. This is in spite of some increase in these measures during the pastmonth. Continued stability and calm in the financial markets, along with approval by the Government of its budget for 2005 in a manner that confirms its fiscal strategy as determined last year, and continued recovery in real economic activity, are the background for the decision not to change the interest rate for September. Concerning the continued stability in the financial markets, most noteworthy are the foreign exchange market, the bond market and the Treasury bill market. Thus, continued calm in the foreign exchange market is expressed inrelatively low trading volumes and heterogeneous activity in the market, i.e.,the presence of demands and supplies on the basis of varied needs and expectations , that largely offset each other. As a result, capital outflows andinflows are balanced and the exchange rate continues to develop without large swings or a trend, with trading spreads that remain low. The behavior of the foreign exchange market is especially notable in light of the contraction in the interest rate differential between the Shekel and the Dollar, and the increase in the (negative) differential between the Shekel and the Pound Sterling. In the government bond market, both non-linked ('Shachar') and index linked ('Galil') yields have been relatively stable for the past four months, after trending higher during the first four months of the year. Yields on short term bills ('makam') reflect the market's view - similar to that of private forecasters - that an increase in Shekel interest rates expected by them will be later thanwas. expected by them in recent months. The commitment of the government to the fiscal strategy adopted last year has been expressed in its passing of the 2005 budget which is basedon a fiscal program through the end of the decade- a budget deficit which does not exceed three percent of GDP and an increase in governmentexpenditures of no more than one percent in real terms annually. This constitutes a necessary basis for continued economic activity and putting the Israeli economy on a path of sustainable growth in the future. The same is true of having actual budgetary performance in 2004 meeting the budget planned. It is important that the 2005 budget which is passed by the Knessetbe consistent with the fiscal strategy of the government. Continuationof this policy will eventually lead to a reduction in the weight of the government debt relative to GDP and lower long term interest rates, and will contribute towards keeping short term interest rates low. This will lay the foundations for private sector led growth and continued financial stability. The recovery in real economic activity continues, including a reductionin government expenditures relative to GDP and expansion of the business sector, by 5 percent in the last four quarters. The Bank of Israel emphasizes that continued growth is dependent on positive developments in private sector investment. This, in turn is dependent on macro-economic policies - fiscal and monetary -which make resources available for private sector activities and support low short and long term real interest rates.

Malaysia,2004-08-25,"Robust activity in the second quarter of 2004 has raised output growth to 8.0%, the highest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2000. The main impetus to growth emanated from stronger private sector expenditure and sustained high growth in external demand. Notwithstanding the stronger aggregate demand and higher global energy prices, the domestic inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, remained low at 1.2% in the second quarter. The underlying inflation in the economy is expected to remain low. On the supply side, producers have also responded with new investments and capacity expansion in key sectors of the economy. Competition and stable conditions in the labour market, as well as productivity improvements have also contributed to the low inflation. Under these circumstances, the current stance of monetary policy will be maintained to support growth. The overnight policy rate will therefore remain unchanged at 2.70%. Bank Negara Malaysia 25 August 2004."
Poland,2004-08-25,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 25 August 2004 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 24-25 August 2004 The Council decided to raise the NBP interest rates by 0.5 percentage point to the level of: ● reference rate 6.5% on an annual basis; ● lombard rate 8.0% on an annual basis; ● deposit rate 5.0% on an annual basis; ● rediscount rate 7.0% on an annual basis. The Council maintains its restrictive monetary policy stance. The resolutions of the MPC come into force as of 26 August 2004. Factors decisive as to the scale of the increase resulted from the August inflation projection and the risk of appearance of wage pressure stemming from inflation expectations. The Council acknowledged this decision as indispensable despite the fact that some of the factors, which in the last few months contributed to an increase in inflation, in particular the price effects of Poland's European Union entry, are slowly abating. Endeavouring that the increased inflation has a transitory effect, the Council does not change its position that the tightening of monetary policy should take place gradually. There has been a continued revival in the world economy. In the United States investment expenditures, which have been growing for the fifth consecutive quarter, were the main factor in pushing up an increase in the GDP; while in Germany, the largest economy in the euro area, the main source of the GDP increase in the first half of 2004 were strong exports. Positive signals and economic data for the euro area indicate an economic rebound (including a stronger increase in consumption in many countries of the euro area in Q1 of 2004 than in the previous year, as well as increased investments). The economic revival in countries being Poland's most important trading partners should  ceteris paribus -contribute to an increase in demand for Polish exports. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. The increase in the price of oil in world markets, which took place to date, contributed to the acceleration of inflation in most of the world economies. This was reflected in the worsening of consumer confidence in the US and in the euro area. The present increase in the price of oil should not significantly decrease the growth dynamics of the world economy. This results foremost from the fact that the current level of real oil prices as well as their growth rate are significantly lower than the ones registered during oil crises. However, one cannot exclude the negative influence of continued high oil prices on the economic growth of Poland's main trading partners. The Polish economy is in a strong growth phase. According to the NBP estimates the annual growth rate of the GDP in Q2 of 2004 was around 6% (in comparison with 6.9% in Q1 of 2004). The economic growth results to a large degree from a dynamic exports growth. There are more signals of an increase in investment expenditures and according to the GUS (Central Statistical Office) data investment in enterprises in Q1 of 2004 was higher by 8.7% than in the corresponding period of 2003. A high increase in the level of expenditures manufacturing was registered (by 21.9%) and in the servicing of real estate and firms (by 16%). After a three-year drop investments in trade increased by 7.7%. Published data confirm continued positive assessment on the part of enterprises of the future economic situation and the possibility of marketing production from new investments. An increase in the utilisation of the production capacity, which was observed for several quarters (it reached a level of 80.7% at the end of Q2 of 2004), favours the appearance of inflationary pressure; in longer perspective it should be softened through supply effects of the currently increasing investments. Added to this are the effects of high oil prices and of other raw materials, the effects of low grain crops in 2003 and the price effects resulting from Poland's EU entry, and in particular an increase in the price of Polish food products and a VAT increase on construction materials. The annual inflation rate rose in July 2004 to 4.6%, remaining above the MPC's upper tolerance limit for deviations from the inflation target. A high PPI growth was maintained (8.6%). There was also an increase in the majority of the core inflation measures from a level of 2.3%-4.5% in June 2004 to 2.3%-5.1% in July 2004. In line with the assessment that will be presented in the August Inflation Report, to be published on 31 August 2004, it is expected that within the next two years the GDP growth rate will amount to 4.5%-5.5%. Starting in 2005, the role of net exports in economic growth will drop  amongst other as a result of expected real appreciation of the zloty  and investments should become the decisive factor in growth. The high growth of investment outlays in 2005-2006 will be a consequence of both a low base of the index, high level of production capacity utilisation, as well as a result of the influence of investments independent of the business cycle (including those financed from EU funds) with an accompanying multiplier effect. The sustainability of the economic revival shall be conditioned on the performance of public finances reforms. Lack of necessary reforms may lead to exceeding the next prudential thresholds of the public debt to the GDP ratio and producing the significant effect of raising the risk premium in Poland, which through the zloty depreciation may become a source of additional inflationary pressure. In line with the inflation projection which will be presented in the August Inflation Report, assuming there is no change in the interest rates, the probability of inflation remaining above the inflation target of 2.5% in 2005 and 2006 is higher than the likelihood that inflation rate will remain below the target. With a likelihood of 50%, inflation rate will remain within a range of 2.8%-5.5% in Q4 of 2005 and 1.6%-5.1% in Q4 in 2006. In 2005  in line with experts' assessments  supply shocks will gradually abate, there will be a particularly strong drop in the food prices growth rate. These factors will result in lower inflation. However, a decrease in inflation will depend on the development of inflation expectations and their influence on wages and prices. -2 - The risk related to inflation growth are foremost the growing household inflation expectations, which rose in August 2004 to 4.5%, as against 4.0% in July 2004 and 0.8% in August 2003. One should note, however, that in the last month the growth in inflation expectations was lower than the increase in current inflation. According to the Council, the development of expectations in the future will to a large extent depend on the conduct of monetary policy. The Council considers that some of the factors which in the last months contributed to an increase in inflation are gradually abating, especially some of the price effects stemming from Poland's entry into the EU. Moreover, the increase in wages remains moderate, while the annual growth of labour productivity in industry continues to exceed the wage growth. As a result the annual growth of unit labour costs remains negative. An increase in employment shown in the Labour Force Survey is not confirmed by data from the enterprises sector. The Council will meet on 9 September 2004 when it will discuss the Monetary Policy Guidelines for the Year 2005. The next meeting of the Council at which the parameters of monetary policy will be discussed will take place on 28 - 29 September."
Thailand,2004-08-25,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 25 August 2004 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. Given the latest economic data, the MPC viewed that the Thai economy continued to expand, driven by exports and private investment. However rising world oil prices is an important factor that should be closely monitored as they could affect future economic expansion and inflation. In July, headline inflation clearly showed signs of acceleration, notwithstanding measures to stabilize domestic retail oil prices. Headline inflation rose 31 per cent year-on-year, or on a seasonally adjusted basis by 05 per cent month-on-month. Core inflation also accelerated, rising 07 per cent year-on-year, or 04 per cent when seasonally adjusted compared to June. The MPC viewed that domestic inflationary pressure would be higher going forward due to continuously increasing capacity utilization, rising domestic oil prices, and a tightening labour market. Consequently the inflation trend should be monitored closely, especially as the pressure could be higher than that reflected in the price indices because of administered prices of certain commodities. External stability remained satisfactory, with continued current account surpluses, declining external debt, and higher international reserves. The MPC viewed that continued domestic spending and rising oil prices would increasingly exert pressure on the current account. With regard to financial imbalances, the MPC observed that although currently there were no clear signs of overheating in household debt and the real estate sectors, these two sectors should be closely monitored. 5. The MPC assessed the impact of the rising oil prices to the economy and viewed that escalating oil prices would exert more pressure on economic stability than on economic expansion. Moreover robust economic fundamentals and the strong fiscal position should allow the economy to adjust to the rising oil prices without interrupting the momentum of growth. Although the economy continued to expand, the risks to economic stability has increased. The MPC thus deemed that the need to maintain the interest rate at the presently low level has become less necessary. Consequently the monetary policy stance should be adjusted to address the issue of economic stability, with the adjustments being gradually paced. The MPC thus decided to raise the 14-day repurchase rate by 25 basis points, from 125 to 150 per cent per annum, effective from today, and would closely monitor risk factors that could affect economic expansion and inflationary pressure, especially oil prices going forward."
Romania,2004-08-30,"The National Bank of Romania Board, after having reviewed the trends for the period to come and the recent developments in disinflation and external accounts, has decided to lower the policy rate by half of a percentage point. The National Bank of Romania will maintain the prudent monetary policy stance to ensure that macroeconomic equilibria remain in place and to achieve the inflation target for 2005."
Euroarea,2004-09-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the President of the ECOFIN Council. Mr Zalm, and Commissioner Almunia. We noted that the information which has become available in recent months indicates that the economic recovery in the euro area has maintained its momentum and should remain firm in the coming quarters. We have also witnessed somewhat higher inflation rates, mainly due to developments in oil prices. At present, our judgement is that although some upside risks to price stability exist, the overall prospects remain in line with price stability over the medium term. Accordingly, we have retained our monetary policy stance and left the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The level of interest rates is very low by historical standards, both in nominal and in real terms, lending support to economic activity. We will remain vigilant with regard to all developments which could imply risks to price stability over the medium term. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. The latest data releases confirm that the economic recovery in the euro area is continuing. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, real GDP grew by 0.5% quarter on quarter in the second quarter of this year, having recorded a 0.6% increase in the first quarter. These growth rates are the strongest in the euro area for some time. The latest indicators of output and demand remain consistent with ongoing growth in real activity, increasingly supported by domestic demand, also in the third quarter of 2004. Looking ahead, the conditions for a continuation of the recovery remain in place. Economic growth outside the euro area continues to be robust overall, even if subject to temporary fluctuations, and should continue to support euro area export growth. On the domestic side, investment should benefit from the positive global environment and the very favourable financing conditions. Improvements in corporate efficiency and higher profits are also supporting business investment. Moreover, private consumption should continue its gradual recovery, broadly in line with growth in real disposable income which, with the usual lag, should be further underpinned by an increase in employment growth later on. Against this background, we expect the economic recovery in the euro area to continue and to become more broadly based over the coming quarters, leading to a somewhat stronger upswing in the course of 2005. This is also reflected in the ECB staff projections, which will be published today. They envisage euro area real GDP growth of between 1.6% and 2.2% on average in 2004, rising to between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2005. These growth rates are close to estimates for long-run potential growth and, for both years, they are slightly higher than was expected in the June Eurosystem staff projections. Available forecasts from international organisations and other sources convey a broadly similar picture. Overall, the risks to these projections seem to be broadly balanced. On the upside, the ongoing momentum of the recovery may again imply more positive developments for economic growth in the coming quarters. On the downside, there are still concerns about continuing economic imbalances in other parts of the world. These imbalances could affect the sustainability of the economic recovery. Another downside risk to the growth projections relates to oil prices. If these were to remain higher than currently expected by markets, this could dampen both foreign and domestic demand. In assessing these risks, however, it should be taken into account that, when expressed in euro, the recent rise in oil prices has been significantly smaller than in previous episodes when oil price increases had a major impact on the world economy. In addition, in real terms, oil prices are significantly below the peaks they have reached in the past. Moreover, when compared with the 1970s and 1980s, the oil intensity of production in the euro area and elsewhere has fallen significantly. Finally, it should be kept in mind that, in contrast to previous periods of oil price turmoil, this year's rise in oil prices is not only due to supply-side factors, but is also driven by the strong global expansion. All these factors put the downside risks to economic activity coming from oil prices into perspective. However, recent oil price developments have had a visible direct impact on price developments in the euro area. Eurostat's flash estimate for annual HICP inflation in August was 2.3%, unchanged from July On the basis of current market expectations for oil prices, it appears unlikely that annual inflation rates will return to levels below 2% in the remainder of this year. Looking ahead, however, there are no indications at present of stronger underlying inflationary pressures building up domestically. Recent wage developments have been moderate, and this trend is expected to continue for some time to come in view of the continued high level of unemployment in the euro area. If this is the case, and provided that one-off shocks to prices from other sources such as those seen in 2004 are not repeated, annual inflation rates should drop below 2% in 2005. Against this background the ECB staff projections put average annual HICP inflation at between 2.1% and 2.3% for 2004 and between 1.3% and 2.3% for 2005. The lower end of these ranges is slightly higher than what was projected in June for both 2004 and 2005. The ECB staff projections for inflation are broadly consistent with other recently released forecasts. However, several upward risks to the projections for inflation exist. Concerns relate in particular to oil price developments, which may continue to have a visible impact on inflation. Oil price rises also imply the risk of second-round effects emerging in wage and price-setting, a risk which intensifies when the economic upswing strengthens. A further upward risk relates to the future evolution of indirect taxes and administered prices. Indeed, upside risks to inflation are also reflected in the continued elevated levels of measures of long-term inflation expectations derived from financial market indicators. While these indicators should always be interpreted with caution, their current level calls for particular vigilance. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual rate of M3 growth has moderated significantly since the summer of 2003. This moderation largely represents a normalisation of portfolio allocation behaviour following the easing of the exceptional economic and financial uncertainty which prevailed between 2001 and early 2003. It appears that the reversal of past portfolio shifts is proceeding more slowly than would have been expected on the basis of historical regularities. This may reflect an increased risk aversion of households and firms, given the stock market losses they experienced between 2000 and the spring of 2003. In addition, the low level of interest rates continues to support monetary expansion, especially of the most liquid assets included in the narrow aggregate M1. The low level of interest rates also seems to be fuelling the growth of loans to the private sector, which has risen to a relatively robust rate over recent months. In this respect, the growth rate of mortgage loans to households is rather high and is associated with fairly dynamic housing market developments and real estate prices in several euro area countries. There remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth. At present, it is not clear how this excess liquidity will be used in the future. If significant parts of these liquid holdings were to be transformed into transaction balances, particularly at a time when confidence and economic activity were strengthening, inflationary risks would rise. In addition, high excess liquidity and strong credit growth could become a source for strong asset price increases. To sum up, while the economic analysis indicates that prospects are consistent with price stability being maintained over the medium term, a number of upside risks need to be carefully monitored. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis also supports the case for strong vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability. As regards fiscal policy, first data for 2004 indicate that most euro area countries are likely to miss the original budgetary targets set in their updated stability programmes. In some cases, countries seem to have based their programmes on overly optimistic assumptions for economic developments. In addition, some countries have been implementing fewer consolidation measures than originally planned. As a consequence, the aggregate fiscal balance for the euro area is not likely to improve in 2004. Progress in fiscal consolidation needs to be prioritised and should be part of a comprehensive and growth-friendly reform agenda. The Governing Council remains convinced that there was and there is no need for changes to the text of the Treaty and of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Pact is an appropriate framework for dealing with countries' fiscal developments on a level playing-field. At the same time, we consider that improvements could be introduced in the implementation of the Pact. In line with the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, macroeconomic policies need to be oriented towards growth and stability in the euro area. This also requires sustained efforts to increase the flexibility of labour and product markets in the euro area. In this respect, several governments in the euro area have taken courageous steps over recent months. It is important that the reform momentum is maintained, taking advantage of the economic recovery. This will not only increase overall economic efficiency and enhance longer-term growth prospects in the euro area, but will also strengthen the basis for a sustained economic upswing in the euro area."
Chile,2004-09-07,"TheCentral Bank of Chile Press Release* 7 September 2004 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by the vote of four of its members, to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2% (annual). The minority vote was for maintaining the interest rate. The available information shows that a favorable scenario for the Chilean economy continues to develop, thanks to a positive international environment and the strong expansionary impulse of financial conditions. Against this background, a progressively higher output growth is confirmed, backed by the recent upturn of households and firms' confidence indicators, robust investment and improved perspectives for the labor market. In recent months, annual CPI inflation has begun to normalize, from the low levels earlier in the year. This behavior has been influenced by the rise in some specific utility rates, fuel prices and the progressive increase in core inflation measures (that exclude some goods with more volatile prices). The Central Bank projects that these will continue along this increasing path while the output gap gradually closes. Also, the oil price increase is expected to drive inflation to 3% sooner than previously forecast, although its transmission to other prices will be limited. Against this background, the Board has considered appropriate to introduce a moderate reduction in the marked monetary impulse, which has become less necessary thanks to the favorable recent behavior and perspectives of expenditures and output. The Central Bank of Chile reiterates that it will be alert to make timely adjustments to monetary policy in order to confront any deviations of expected inflation from the specified target range. In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2004-09-09,"The bank of korea. The Bank of Korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.5%) for the intermeeting period. (An unofficial English translation based on the Korean original of the decision on monetary policy taken by the Monetary Policy Committee on September 9, 2004 is attached). In the real economy, private consumption and facilities investment remain sluggish. Exports have exhibited some degree of slowdown in the pace of their expansion. Consumer price and core inflation have risen more rapidly than in the previous month. Along with this, upward pressures on prices may increase as high oil prices are anticipated to persist and an adjustment of charges for some public services is scheduled before the end of this year. Meanwhile, the current account is forecast to maintain a surplus, mainly thanks to the surplus on the goods account. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions have been favorable and both long-term and short-term interest rates have fallen sharply following the policy rate cut. Fund-raising conditions have, nevertheless, remained difficult for small- and medium-sized enterprises with a low credit rating.

Peru,2004-09-09,"Press Release BOARD OF THE CENTRAL BANK APPROVED MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2004 REFERENCE INTEREST RATE IS KEPT AT 2.75% In August, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) diminished 0.01 percent. The cumulative inflation in the January-August period was 3.2 percent. Core inflation, indicator of the inflationary trend, was 2.3 percent in similar period. Transitorily, 12-month inflation is above the upper limit of the target range due to supply shocks in foods and fuels during the first semester. The Import Goods Price Index increased 9.0 percent in the January-August period. The Central Bank forecasts that the 2004 cumulative inflation will be near to the upper bound of the target range (3.5 percent) and, around the mid-point of the range (2.5 percent) for 2005. The policies that the Central Bank is adopting are oriented to achieve the convergence of the inflation toward its target. The Board of the Central Bank decided to maintain the reference interest rates of the monetary operations off auction: The monetary operations regarding injection or withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be made in order to place the interbank interest rate around the center of the corridor set by the reference interest rates (2.75 percent). For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate is kept at 3.5 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate is maintained at 2.0 percent. In case of the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.5 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. For September, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCRP is 170 - 190 million. This average balance is neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it also reflects, among others, seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes. The interest rates for Central Bank's operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP's deposits held abroad. Swaps: the commission is kept to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.5 percent. October Monetary program will be approved in the Board of Directors meeting of October 7, 2004."
Nigeria,2004-09-20,"PRESS RELEASE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA. COMMUNIQUE NO. 38 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE IN SEPTEMBER 2004 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at the end of its 185th meeting agreed to sustain the suspension on the withdrawal of public sector deposits from the deposit money banks, in order to enhance the stability of the financial system. Since the last meeting of the MPC, the pressure on prices has moderated. Both the moving average and point on point inflation rates fell from 194 and 141 per cent in June 2004 to 191 and 107 per cent in July. The gross official reserves have risen from US$122 to US$123 billion, while the arbitrage premium between the DAS exchange rate and the bureaux de change has stabilized around 55 per cent. In addition, the growth in monetary aggregates remained within the program targets as bank credits (net) to government continued to fall owing to prudent fiscal operations of the federal government. In the first eight months of the year, broad money stock (M2) increased by 90 per cent, compared with the permissible expansion rate of 160 per cent for fiscal 2004. For the rest of 2004, the Committee noted that the combined effect of the high international oil price and a continuation of current prudent macroeconomic policies would help to lower the inflation rate close to single digit level by the end of the year. In particular, the Committee expressed optimism that the substantial fiscal savings from the excess crude oil proceeds since the beginning of 2004 would continue to reduce demand pressures during the remaining months of the year. The Committee, therefore, agreed not to introduce any new policy action. However macro economic developments shall continue to be monitored with a view to fine-tuning the existing policies, if necessary. James KA. Olekah Secretary.

United States,2004-09-21,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1-3/4 percent. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. After moderating earlier this year partly in response to the substantial rise in energy prices, output growth appears to have regained some traction, and labor market conditions have improved modestly. Despite the rise in energy prices, inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Thomas M Hoenig; Donald L Kohn; Cathy E Minehan; Mark W Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 2-3/4 percent.

Philippines,2004-09-22,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The Monetary Board believes that the outlook for inflation continues to support the argument for maintaining present monetary settings. In its assessment of the conditions for future inflation and output, the Monetary Board noted that the expected path of inflation over the policy horizon remains hump-shaped, driven mainly by supply-side pressures primarily issuing from the recent uptrend in oil prices and other specific factors. Owing to their transitory, cost-push nature, prospective inflation pressures cannot be addressed properly through monetary action. Monetary tightening reduces inflation mainly by lowering private demand for goods and services, while supply-side factors (such as increases in world oil prices) affect mainly the cost of producing goods and services rather than private demand for these items. Inflation is expected to continue to rise in the coming months but should begin to taper off by mid-2005, assuming no further adverse supply-side shocks occur. Average inflation is likely to exceed the 4-5 percent target for 2004 and 2005 as the full impact of supply-side pressures is reflected in price developments, but should revert to the 4-5 percent target in 2006. Meanwhile, the impact of the recent 25-basis point increase in the US federal funds target rate on inflation is not expected to unduly affect the domestic inflation path, whether through the exchange rate or other channels. The Monetary Board considers the emerging differential between the country's 91-day T-bill rate and the US 90-day T-bill rate to be comfortable. At the same time, the Monetary Board emphasized that the BSP remains firmly committed to delivering stable prices and stands ready to respond to the potential second-order inflationary effects of ongoing supply shocks and guard against persistent price pressures. The BSP will continue to assess economic and financial developments for indications of second-order inflation pressures from supply shocks and, if necessary, undertake a well-timed adjustment in monetary policy settings to arrest the buildup in inflation expectations and prevent inflation persistence. Such a stance is accompanied by continued BSP support for non-monetary measures to address supply-side risks to consumer prices. This is particularly important for major food items affected by supply constraints, by strengthening representation and coordination with concerned government agencies such as the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)."
Israel,2004-09-27,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program forOctober 2004. The Bank of Israel today announced that in the context of its monetary program for October 2004, the interest rate will be unchanged at 4.1 percent, for the sixth month in succession. The decision toleave the interest rate unchanged is based on the fact that assessments of inflation one and two years forward according to inflation expectations derived from the capital market and the predictions of private forecasters has been within the price-stability target range, i.e., 1-3 percent a year, for a considerable period. The background to the decision is ongoing stability in the financial markets, the expectation that the fiscal strategy being pursued in 2004 will continue following the confirmation of the 2005 budget by the government and the recovery in real activity. Developments in the financial markets in the last six months are consistent with the stabilization of theBank of Israel interest rate at 4.1 percent in that period, following its steady reduction month by month from the end of 2002 to April 2004 by a cumulative 5 percentage points. Thus, stabilityin the foreign-currency market persisted during the last six months, with the exchange ratecontinuing to move without wide fluctuations and with no discernible trend, and with low bid-offer spreads. This took place against the backdrop of the continued narrowing of the interest-rate differential, both actual and expected, especially that between the NIS and the dollar. In the government bond and Treasury bill markets too calm has prevailed during the last half year. Nominal yields on government bonds (of the Shahar type) and on CPI-indexed bonds (of the Galil type) are stable, after following an upward trend during the first four months of the year. In the Treasury bill market the three-month yield has been maintained at close to the Bank of Israel interest rate, while the one-year yield declined by about half a percentage point in the last six months. Yields on the Treasury bill market thus reflect expectations of investors as well as of private forecasters that the interest rate will remain stable for some time and will then rise. According to Bank of Israel assessments the performance of the 2004 budget continues to be consistent with the budgetary targets set. At this stage it is important that the Knesset approve the proposed 2005 budget decided upon by the government. This budget expresses a fiscal strategy based on budget targets up to the end of the decade, according to which the deficit will not exceed 3 percent of GDP, and government expenditure will not rise by more than one percent a year in real terms a policy that will lead to the reduction of the government debt burden and of the cost of servicing the debt. This is the foundation required for the reduction of long-term interest and for the returnof the economy onto a path of sustained growth, led by the business sector. The recovery inreal activity is continuing, with a decline in the share of government expenditure in GDP and a considerable rise in business-sector product. At the same time the number of employees has risen, as have the rate of employment and the rates of participation in the labor market which have halted the upward trend in the rate of unemployment. Concurrently the balance of payments has come close to being in balance. It is essentialthat the government persist in important structural reforms in the ports, the financialmarkets, the labor market, and the public services such as in the local authorities. These steps, together with the continuation of the macroeconomic policy, monetary and fiscal, and with vigorous management of infrastructureinvestment, will release resources for private-sector activity and will help tocause a positive turnaround in investment in the principal industries, and thereby ensure the conditions for sustained growth. The process of lowering the interest rate until its convergence to its current level in the last half year is reflected among other things by a low level of real interest, inparticular short term, and by a rise in the money supply. This interest-rate policy provides important support for the continued recovery of real activity based on financial stability in general and price stability in particular.

Poland,2004-09-29,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 29 September 2004 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 28-29 September 2004 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 6.5% on the annual basis; lombard rate 8.0% on the annual basis; deposit rate 5.0% on the annual basis; rediscount rate 7.0% on the annual basis. The Council maintains its restrictive monetary policy bias. Signals appearing after the publication of the August Inflation Report confirm the previous forecasts of economic growth. If the appreciation of the zloty visible in Q3 persists, it will be more probable that inflation in the mid-term perspective will be slightly lower than it was presented in the Report. The developments in the world economy point to the continuation of the tendencies observed since the beginning of the year and corresponding to the expectations presented in the August Inflation Report. Data on the US economy, particularly those on the job market and the activity in the industrial sector, reinforce the optimistic outlook for the growth of the world economy. World demand remains robust and the major economic climate indicators are improving in the euro zone, which allows one to expect that the recovery unfolding in the region will continue. This expectation is reflected in the fact that euro-zone growth forecasts of the main international analytical centres were adjusted upwards. The ECB's September projection indicates that the growth in the euro zone will oscillate within 1.6 and 2.2% in 2004, and 1.8 and 2.8% in 2005. The gradual improvement in international economic climate, with other factors unchanged, should contribute to an increase in demand for Polish exports. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. The high and still increasing prices of crude oil have not yet translated into a significant rise in inflationary pressure in main world economies. Also, the inflation expectations in the euro zone remain consistent with the assumptions of the inflation projection presented in the August Inflation Report. The assessment of economic processes in Poland has not been changed significantly in relation to the August Inflation Report. Polish economy is in the phase of dynamic growth. Annual GDP growth rate in 2004 Q2 amounted to 6.1% (in comparison to 6.9% in Q1). Recovery in domestic demand and the fast growing exports were the main factors contributing to the growth. A moderate recovery in investment was also recorded. August 2004 annual headline inflation remained at the July level of 4.6%. Also, three out of five core inflation measures did not change while the remaining two increased only slightly (by 0.1 percentage point). The difference between the headline inflation and “net inflation” excluding food and fuel prices stabilized in August, which points to a deceleration of price growth in these groups of products. This is consistent with the expectations presented in the August Inflation Report. The recent appreciation of the zloty has alleviated the impact of high crude oil prices on the fuel prices in domestic market. The abating of some of the factors which have contributed to inflation growth in the past few months is also signalled by a deceleration in the growth rate of inflation expectations of individuals in September 2004 (4.6% in the 12-month horizon). Nevertheless, they remain high, which lifts the risk of wage pressure. In the period since the last MPC meeting there have appeared disconcerting signals indicating to wage demand escalation. The still persisting high growth of producer prices in industry (8.7%) has mainly resulted from the growth of domestic prices, since the appreciation of the zloty has had a breaking effect on the growth of export prices. Considering a very high level of production capacity utilisation in manufacturing, high inflation expectations and recovery in domestic demand, the risk of cost effects pushing the inflation up remains considerable. Data collected since the last MPC meeting support the August Report's expectations that in the next two years GDP growth rate will stand at 4.5-5.5%. Starting from 2005, net exports will cease to be a factor increasing the rate of economic growth; this role will be taken over by domestic demand, and primarily investment demand. The expected inflation decrease from the second half of 2005 onwards should be supported by the vanishing of unfavourable supply shocks and some price effects connected with Poland's entry to the EU. The decrease in inflation in the situation of a high economic growth will be, to a large extent, dependent on the inflation expectations and their influence on wages and prices. Should the currently observed appreciation of the zloty turn out permanent, the probability of lower inflation as compared to the central projection presented in August will increase. However, in view -2 - of the diversity of factors influencing the zloty exchange rate and its resultant high volatility, the assessment of the current appreciation's impact on future inflation is subject to a considerable uncertainty. The moderate level of wage growth at the moment, together with the still relatively high growth of labour productivity as well as a delay (according to GUS data) in investment recovery in relation to what was expected in August, will have some, though limited, influence on the faster than expected rate of inflation drop in the projection horizon. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 26-27 October 2004."
Euroarea,2004-10-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to the press conference here in Brussels. Today's meeting is the tenth time that the Governing Council has met outside Frankfurt, and I would like to thank Governor Quaden for his invitation. Let me also express our gratitude to the staff of the Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique for their kind hospitality and perfect organisation of today's meeting. As regards economic growth, while some uncertainty has recently arisen concerning the expected strengthening of activity, the economic recovery in the euro area is ongoing. Looking at price developments, high oil prices have had a visible direct impact on inflation rates this year. However, the risk of second-round effects still seems to be contained, and the overall outlook remains consistent with price stability over the medium term. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged. This means that the level of interest rates continues to be very low by historical standards, in both nominal and real terms. Strong vigilance is warranted with regard to all developments which could imply risks to price stability over the medium term. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. The information available to date indicates that the economic recovery in the euro area is continuing. In particular, survey indicators up to September point to ongoing growth in industrial production and the services sector. Moreover, the gradual recovery in consumer confidence is proceeding, and there are some tentative signs of an improvement in the prospects for employment, although available indicators for household spending do not yet point to an immediate strengthening of consumption growth. All in all, the growth momentum seen in the euro area in the first half of 2004 should be broadly maintained in the coming quarters, in line with available forecasts from international organisations. On the external side, euro area exports should continue to benefit from favourable global demand conditions, not least from trade with the new EU Member States, where import demand has been strengthening. On the domestic side, investment should benefit from the positive global environment and the very favourable financing conditions in the euro area. As companies restructure, improvements in corporate efficiency and higher profits are also supporting business investment. Moreover, there is scope for a recovery in euro area private consumption, in line with growth in real disposable income. Any central scenario for future developments is surrounded by a good deal of uncertainty, which at present is particularly related to oil prices. If oil prices were to remain high, or even increase further, it could dampen the strength of the recovery, both inside and outside the euro area, even though the oil intensity of production has fallen significantly since the 1970s and 1980s. All in all, while the burden resulting from higher oil prices cannot be avoided, its medium-term impact should be of a more limited magnitude than in the past. Obviously, for this outcome to materialise, all parties concerned must live up to their responsibilities. Turning to consumer prices, the oil market developments have had a direct impact on the euro area HICP. Following an annual rate of inflation of 1.7% in the first quarter of 2004, inflation reached 2.3% in the second quarter and remained at that level in July and August. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation seems to have fallen slightly in September, to 2.2%. Higher energy prices may have been more than compensated by lower food prices, partly due to base effects resulting from last year's strong increases in this sub-category. Still, on the basis of current market expectations for oil prices, it appears unlikely that annual inflation rates will return to levels below 2% in the remainder of this year. Nevertheless, looking further ahead, the available information does not indicate that stronger underlying inflationary pressures are building up domestically. Recent wage developments have remained moderate, and this trend should continue. On the basis of this assumption, and provided that there are no further significant shocks to prices, annual inflation rates should drop below 2% in 2005. Several upward risks to the outlook for price stability continue to exist. Concerns again relate to oil price developments, in particular to the extent that second-round effects stemming from wage and price-setting behaviour materialise. It is therefore of the utmost importance to avoid inappropriate reactions, as observed in past episodes of strong oil price increases. A further upward risk relates to the future development of indirect taxes and administered prices. These upside risks call for ongoing vigilance, which is a necessary condition for keeping medium to long-term inflation expectations in line with our definition of price stability. As regards the monetary analysis. M3 growth remains resilient. The downward trend in annual M3 growth from mid-2003 appears to have halted over the summer months, and the shorter-term dynamics of M3 have strengthened. This reflects the fact that the historically low level of interest rates in the euro area continues to support monetary expansion, especially of the most liquid assets included in the narrow aggregate M1. The low level of interest rates also fuels the growth of MFI credit. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector remains robust, largely driven by the dynamism of mortgage loans. These are also supported by strong house price increases in several euro area countries. There remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth. At present, it is not clear how this excess liquidity, which is mainly the result of past portfolio shifts, will be used in the future. If significant parts of these liquid holdings were to be transformed into transaction balances, particularly at a time when confidence and economic activity were strengthening, inflationary risks would rise. In addition, high excess liquidity and strong credit growth could become a source of substantial asset price increases. To sum up, annual inflation rates should fall below 2% in 2005, but a number of medium-term upside risks to price stability need to be carefully monitored. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis also supports the case for strong vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability. Let me also address the current evidence on fiscal developments, where the latest budgetary notifications are a source of concern. While some countries will maintain a sound budgetary position, a significant number of euro area countries are expected to record deficits near to or above 3%. The aggregate euro area fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase somewhat, as is the debt-to-GDP ratio. In the coming years, important challenges for the consolidation of public finances will have to be faced. Member States need to renew their consolidation efforts and should not rely on one-off measures, so as to comply with their commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact and to foster confidence. They must also set the right priorities in public finances, towards structural reform, innovation and competitiveness. This would very much support the Lisbon agenda and thereby promote economic growth, foster job creation and reduce unemployment. Concerning the European fiscal framework, the Governing Council is convinced that substantial improvements in the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact are possible and would be beneficial, while we would warn against a change to the text of the Treaty or the Regulations which form the basis of the Pact. We consider the Pact as key to ensuring macroeconomic stability on a sustainable basis. It is a framework which is necessary to preserve sound fiscal policies in the euro area, for which strict surveillance and effective peer pressure on national budget policies are indispensable. It is of vital importance to the credibility of the budgetary surveillance that the reliable compilation and timely reporting of government finance statistics is ensured. The European accounting rules must be fully respected when recording all types of expenditure and revenue. This should be done in a manner that is consistent and stable over time and homogeneous across countries. The procedures must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles, as stated by the ECOFIN Council. Countries should consider the quality and integrity of their statistics as a priority matter. Finally, let me report on the detailed discussion we had today on employment and unemployment developments in the euro area. Two observations stand out when we look at the period of relatively slow real GDP expansion since early 2001. First, after an initial rise, the euro area unemployment rate has remained broadly unchanged since early 2003. And second, there seems to have been a relatively limited negative impact on employment growth over the past few years. While the period of slow growth has been relatively long from a historical perspective, the cyclical amplitudes have been smaller and have not therefore triggered very sharp reactions of employment and unemployment. In addition, wage developments have been more favourable than in previous episodes, and firms may have – to a greater extent than previously – adjusted labour input downwards in term of hours, rather than in terms of employees. This in turn might indicate that firms have gained an element of flexibility to adjust costs. Looking forward, from a cyclical point of view, employment should recover and unemployment could start falling in the course of next year if overall demand develops as expected. This should support economic growth through an increase in labour income and a positive impact on consumer confidence, and thus on consumption. This is highlighted, for example, by the fact that over 40% of all unemployed people in the euro area have been without a job for more than a year. In order to decisively overcome the obstacles towards more employment growth and to reduce the trend or structural level of unemployment, further comprehensive labour market reforms are of the essence."
South Korea,2004-10-07,"The bank of korea. The Bank of Korea. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.5%) for the intermeeting period. (An unofficial English translation based on the Korean original of the decision on monetary policy taken by the Monetary Policy Committee on October 7, 2004 is attached). In the real economy, private consumption remains sluggish, yet facilities investment shows a very modest recovery. The pace of export growth has declined to some extent. Meanwhile, the current account is still in surplus, mainly thanks to the surplus on the goods account. The core inflation rate has been increasing and consumer price inflation continues to show unstable movements, while upward pressure on prices may be mounting as high oil prices are anticipated to persist. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions have been favorable, yet fund-raising conditions have not improved for small- and medium-sized enterprises with low credit ratings. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.5 percent) for the intermeeting period."
Peru,2004-10-07,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2004 CENTRAL BANK RAISES REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 2.75% TO 3.00% In September, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increases 0.02 percent. The cumulative inflation in the January-September period stayed at 3.2 percent. Core inflation, indicator of the inflationary trend, was 2.3 percent in similar period. Transitorily, 12-month inflation is above the upper limit of the target range due to supply shocks in foods and fuels during the first semester. The Import Goods Price Index increased 9.3 percent in the January-September period. The Central Bank forecasts that the 2004 cumulative inflation will be near to the upper limit of the target range (3.5 percent) and, around the mid-point of the range (2.5 percent) for 2005. Core inflation will be slightly above the mid-point of the range in both years. The Board of the Central Bank approved to raise in 25 basis points the reference interest rates of the monetary operations: The monetary operations regarding injection and withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be made in order to place the interbank interest rate around the center of the corridor set by the reference interest rates (3.00 percent). For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate went up from 3.50 percent to 3.75 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate went up from 2.00 percent to 2.25 percent. In case of the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.75 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. For October, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCRP is 190 - 210 million. This average balance is neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it also reflects, among others, seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes. The interest rates for Central Bank's operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP's deposits held abroad. Swaps: the commission is raised to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.75 percent. November Monetary program will be approved in the Board of Directors meeting of November 4, 2004."
Chile,2004-10-12,"The Central Bank of Chile Press Release* 12 October 2004 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2% (annual). Since the last meeting, the international environment remains positive, even though the oil price has increased above earlier projections, which is a significant source of risk. Meanwhile, the growth pace of domestic output and expenditure has strengthened. Investment continues to build up dynamism, foreign trade is expanding rapidly and consumer indicators look good, despite the persistence of mixed indicators in the labor market. In this positive picture, the expectation of a gradual compression of the output gap is reaffirmed. Nevertheless, beyond the effects of international fuel prices, inflation remains low. This is apparent in core inflation measures (that exclude some goods with more volatile prices) and in the evolution of cost pressures, e.g. labor pressures, and imported inflation excluding fuels. The Board reiterates that, in the most likely scenario, it will continue to reduce the present marked monetary impulse at a measured pace, in order to maintain annual expected inflation centered around 3% in the usual policy horizon. In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
South Africa,2004-10-14,"Inflation has receded to historically low levels and has consistently remained within the CPIX inflation target of between 3 and 6 per cent in the past twelve months. This favourable outcome is mainly the result of disciplined monetary and fiscal policies pursued by the authorities. The low rates of increase in the general price level of South Africa have been recorded in an economic environment characterised by an expansion in real gross domestic product, which has now lasted for nearly 6 years, notwithstanding the recent period of slower growth in the world economy. Achieving low inflation has allowed interest rates to be reduced and has provided an additional platform for economic growth. Increases in the volume of exports were at first mainly responsible for the steady growth in domestic production. More recently, growth in real gross domestic expenditure picked up considerably and reached a level at a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 13 per cent in the second quarter of 2004. The twelve-month rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost of mortgage bonds (the CPIX) decreased from a peak of 11,3 per cent in October and November 2002 to 5,4 per cent in September 2003. CPIX inflation then remained within the inflation target range and declined further to 3,7 per cent in August 2004. If energy prices are omitted, year-on-year CPIX inflation amounted to 3,5 per cent in August 2004. The deceleration in inflation can mainly be attributed to slower rates of increase in the prices of consumer goods. The year-on-year rate of increase in the prices of consumer goods decreased from 13,0 per cent in October 2002 to 3,8 per cent in September 2003 and 2,0 per cent in December. It then fluctuated between 2 and 4 per cent in the ensuing period largely depending on adjustments in the prices of petrol and diesel. In August 2004 the year-on-year rate of increase in these prices amounted to 2,1 per cent. In contrast to the prices of consumer goods, the prices of consumer services remained stubbornly high owing especially to continued high increases in administered prices. The twelve-month rate of increase in the prices of consumer services included in the CPIX at first increased from 7,4 per cent in October 2002 to 8,6 per cent in September 2003. It then declined marginally to 8,1 per cent in February 2004, before moving down more markedly to 6,6 per cent in August. The significant effect that the recovery in the exchange rate of the rand has had on the improvement in domestic inflation is clearly illustrated by developments in the prices of producer goods. The prices of imported goods, which had increased at a year-on-year rate of 17,2 per cent in September 2002, started to decline from April 2003. Since then these prices have declined continuously for a period of seventeen months. In August the index value of the prices of imported goods was approximately 10 per cent lower than at its peak in October 2003. The decline in the prices of imported goods has materially influenced the adjustments in the prices of domestically produced goods. Although the prices of goods produced in South Africa continued to increase, the rate of increase slowed down considerably and amounted to a year-on-year level of 2,3 per cent in August 2004. As a result, the year-on-year rate of increase in the all-goods production index was 1,1 per cent in this month. The low rate of increase in production prices augers well for inflation going forward. Thus the inflation outlook over the longer term is promising. The Bank's forecasts show that CPIX inflation should stay within the boundaries of the inflation target range over the next two years, moving moderately higher over the coming year, but thereafter easing somewhat. A number of factors are probably responsible for this favourable inflation outlook. One of the developments that has led to lower recorded inflation has been the decline in inflation expectations. According to the Survey of Inflation Expectations by the Bureau for Economic Research at the University of Stellenbosch commissioned by the South African Reserve Bank, expected CPIX inflation has declined to within the inflation target range for the three years from 2004 to 2006. This is the first time since the inception of the survey in the third quarter of 2002 that CPIX inflation expectations for all three forecast years have fallen within the target range. This is a welcome development indeed. A number of other factors support a low inflation outcome. These include the fiscal prudence applied by government, an improved outlook for food prices (despite the serious drought in some parts of the Western Cape), commitment by the public authorities to contain administered price increases and low inflation, on average, in the rest of the world. As already indicated, the recovery in the external value of the rand since the beginning of 2002 has been a significant factor supporting the positive inflation outcome. The external value of the rand has been relatively steady in 2004. The volatility in the exchange rate of the rand has moderated and the rand has become generally more stable in the foreign exchange markets over this period. Going forward it is difficult to predict movements in exchange rates. To a large extent the external value of the rand will depend on balance of payments developments. The deficit on the current account of South Africa's balance of payments widened in the first half of 2004 to a seasonally adjusted and annualised value of R31,8 billion, or 2,5 per cent of gross domestic product. Preliminary trade figures for July and August indicate that a further deficit on the current account will probably be recorded in the third quarter of 2004. The deficit on the current account was comfortably financed by large financial inflows. The net financial inflow into the country (including unrecorded transactions) amounted to approximately R40 billion in the first six months of 2004. These inflows consisted mainly of government long-term loans, increases in the short-term liabilities of banks, portfolio capital and trade finance provided by non-residents. The large net financial inflows enabled the Bank to increase the official foreign exchange holdings of the country from US$8,0 billion on 31 December 2003 to US$12,4 billion at the end of September 2004. The rates of increase in consumption expenditure and capital formation have also led to an acceleration in the growth of gross domestic product and have probably narrowed the gap between potential and actual domestic production. The favourable projected inflation outcome could also be at risk due to developments in the international oil market. The monthly average Brent crude price of oil has increased from a lower turning point of US$18,60 per barrel in December 2001 to US$29,88 per barrel in December 2003 and US$42,81 per barrel in September 2004. At present Brent crude oil is trading around US$50 per barrel. This increase in international oil prices occurred despite an increase in the production of oil by OPEC countries. Geopolitical developments and a number of disruptions to oil production have led to perceived tight supply conditions, while demand has remained strong as a result of the world economic recovery, particularly high economic growth in China, and stock building. Over the longer term continued high increases in nominal unit labour cost could put pressure on price increases. Having averaged 5,0 per cent in 2003, the rate of increase in labour cost per unit of production in the formal non-agricultural sectors of the economy rose to a year-on-year rate of 6,3 per cent in the first quarter of 2004 and 7,8 per cent in the second quarter. These increases in unit labour cost were recorded in spite of the fact that the rate of increase in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sectors of the economy slowed down. However, labour productivity growth decreased in the first quarter of 2004, and in the second quarter of this year labour productivity declined in absolute terms. In addition, the growth of the monetary aggregates suggests that some inflation pressures could arise over the long term. Growth in the broadly defined money supply (M3), which had been relatively firm in the first six months of 2004 when measured on a year-on-year basis, rose from 11,8 per cent in June to 13,3 per cent in August. The more narrowly defined monetary aggregates increased at even considerably higher rates in July and August 2004. Moreover, the increases in the money supply aggregates were moderated to some extent by disintermediation, i.e. the extension of loans between organisations in the non-bank private sector. The twelve-month growth rate in credit extension to the private sector, excluding investments and bills discounted, rose from a low of 8,9 per cent in June 2004 to 11,5 per cent in August. In evaluating these growth rates it is important to take into account that they were influenced by the disintermediation practices just referred to, as well as by a shift from domestic to foreign financing of international trade. It was mainly enterprises that undertook these transactions, while households increasingly made use of bank credit extension. This is clearly reflected in the growth of asset-backed loans of banks, which are mainly made to households. In August 2004 these kind of loans were 18,8 per cent above their level in the same month of the preceding year. Cognisance may usefully be taken also of the likely impact of external developments: in particular, the timing and manner of the processes of adjustment to existing international imbalances. The Monetary Policy Committee has concluded that leaving the repo rate unchanged at 7,5 per cent per annum at this meeting would be consistent with CPIX inflation remaining within the target range in the forecast period. However, the Committee will continue to monitor the various factors which impact on inflation and will accordingly make any decisions based on the inflation outlook going forward."
Nigeria,2004-10-20,"PRESS RELEASE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA. COMMUNIQUE NO. 39 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. IN OCTOBER, 2004 The 186th meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee was held on October 12th, 2004. Available information since the last meeting of the MPC indicated that the year- on-year inflation rate had increased from 107 per cent in July 2004 to 130 per cent in August 2004. The 12-month moving average inflation rate remained unchanged at the July 2004 level of 1910 per cent. The exchange rate of the naira was relatively stable, while the gross official reserves rose further from US $1248 billion to US $1327 at end- September 2004. Broad money stock (M ) rose by 99 per cent in the first nine months 2 of 2004, representing an annualized growth rate of 132 per cent. This growth rate is within the 160 per cent target set for 2004. Credit (net) to government contracted further, reflecting the prudent fiscal operations of the federal government. The Committee was optimistic that the external reserves would rise further during the remaining months of 2004, following the high international oil price and the expected seasonal drop in the demand for foreign exchange in the last quarter. The Committee also expects that a continuation of prudent fiscal operations would help to dampen excess demand. Nevertheless the rise in the domestic pirce level was considered worrisome by the Committee. The Committee agreed to monitor macroeconomic developments very closely during the rest of 2004, with a view to fine tuning existing policies if the need arises. James K Olekah Secretary. Monetary Policy Committee. Central Bank of Nigeria. Abuja."
Philippines,2004-10-20,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. In its assessment of the monetary policy stance, the Monetary Board noted that conditions for output and inflation over the policy horizon continue to support the case for maintaining the BSP's policy interest rates at their current levels. Indications of price pressures across commodity groups from CPI data are outweighed by the presence of relatively high unemployment and moderate credit activity in the economy. Such conditions imply that the current inflation uptrend is originating mainly from the supply side rather than the demand side. In the absence of clear evidence of demand-side effects of supply shocks or mounting demand-side inflationary pressures, monetary authorities have opted to maintain the present settings for monetary policy. Given the dominant role of supply-side developments in the inflation outlook, inflation can be best mitigated in the near term by appropriate supply-side (or non-monetary) policy measures that would facilitate production, timely importation, distribution and delivery of key commodities. The BSP continues to articulate its support for the use of such measures to address supply bottlenecks and accordingly has made representations with relevant government agencies on the matter. Nevertheless, the present stance does not mean that monetary action will not be used to counter inflationary pressures in the future. The BSP recognizes the risk of a sustained period of rising oil prices that could lead to economic dislocations in the form of reductions in domestic demand and self-sustaining inflation pressures reinforced by public expectations of persistently high inflation. In this connection, the Monetary Board reiterated that the inflation process continues to be driven by supply factors that are deemed short-lived. Inflation, which is expected to be higher than the 4-5 percent target for 2004 and 2005, is expected to return to the 4-5 percent range in 2006. Monetary action will become necessary when the available evidence begins to point more strongly to the following conditions: emerging demand-side pressures on prices; and inflation pressures that are over and above those generated by ongoing supply shocks. In addition, authorities also recognize the risk of prolonged exchange market pressure caused by narrowing nominal interest differentials, ample liquidity among banks, and negative market sentiment that could feed into inflation and inflation expectations. However, the Monetary Board noted that prevailing interest rate differentials continue to be sizeable. The differentials between Philippine 91-day Treasury bill and the US 90-day T-bill and the 90-day LIBOR (net of withholding tax), for example, are currently more than 400 basis points. These levels of differentials are roughly the same as those observed before the monetary tightening by the US Federal Reserve, since market interest rates have risen during this period. Given these considerations, the BSP will continue to assess economic and financial developments for indications of potential threats to the inflation target and, when necessary, undertake a measured policy response."
Thailand,2004-10-20,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 20 October 2004 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. On the basis of recent economic and monetary information, the MPC was of the view that current economic conditions have been affected by high oil prices, with more consolidation in some economic activities, notably the slowdown in consumption expenditure. Nevertheless the economy still has considerable momentum going forward with support from expansion of exports, private investment and government investment. However external uncertainty has increased, especially regarding oil prices and the global economic outlook, which could pose greater risks to the Thai economy. Economic stability remained satisfactory, with continued current account surpluses and higher international reserves. Nonetheless rising oil prices exerted more pressure on the trade balance and domestic inflation. The latest data showed that headline inflation accelerated to 36 per cent in September, while core inflation rose to 06 per cent. Core inflation excluding housing rent—a factor that kept core inflation low during the previous periods—was at 09 per cent. Going forward, inflationary risks would be greater, as a result of continued economic expansion, increasing capacity utilization, a tightening labour market, credit expansion, and plausible upward adjustments in the consumer prices due to higher production costs. These factors would increase inflationary pressures next year, both on headline and core inflation. Consequently risks to inflation going forward would be higher than previously estimated. Since domestic inflation is projected to accelerate while the economy's growth outlook remains satisfactory, the MPC thus deemed that there is less need to maintain the interest rates at low levels. Domestic interest rates should begin to adjust to the levels that are most consistent with maintaining economic stability. The adjustment should be gradually paced in order to maintain continued growth momentum with economic stability. The MPC thus decided to raise the 14-day repurchase rate by 25 basis points, from 150 to 175 per cent per annum, effective from today, and would closely monitor the effects on economic stability and growth going forward, in order to determine the monetary policy stance consistent with economic conditions."
Israel,2004-10-25,"The Bank of Israel'sMonetary Program for November 2004. The Bank of Israel today announced that in the context of its monetary program for November 2004, the interest rate will be unchanged at 4.1 percent for the eighth month in succession. The decision to leave the interest rate unchanged is based on assessments of inflation one and two years forward-according to inflation expectations derived from the capital market and the predictions of private forecasters-which for a considerable period have been within the price-stability target range, i.e., 1-3 percent a year, and which have been around the mid-point of that range in the last few months. The stability in the financial markets evident in the last few months strengthens the ability of the Bank of Israel's policy to maintain price stability at the current interest level. The foreign-currency market continues to be stable-reflected in low bid-offer spreads, with the exchange rate continuing to move without wide fluctuations and with no discernible trend. Since the beginning of the year the NIS depreciated moderately, by between 1 percent and 1.5 percent, against the dollar, the euro and the currency basket. This took place against the backdrop of the continued narrowing of the interest-rate differential, especially that between the NIS and the dollar. In the government bond and Treasury bill markets too calm has prevailed during the last half year, reflected mainly in steady yields, with a slight downward trend. Nevertheless, if the current situation persists, several developments are likely to affect the behavior of the financial markets and the future path of inflation, and will necessitate a change to the present interest-rate policy in order to preserve price stability as required by the target. First, the Knesset must without delay approve the proposed 2005 budget along the lines decided upon by the government, including the deficit and expenditure targets. This is essential in order to remove as quickly as possible the uncertainty in this area that derives from the current political uncertainty. Adherence to the deficit and expenditure targets is a prerequisite for halting the rise in the government debt burden and for maintaining interest rates close to the norms abroad, which are required to support economic growth. It is important that the process of approving the budget be transparent, and that it show the overall budget picture. Any slackening of the fiscal discipline that the government is observing strictly and that is embodied in the proposed 2005 budgetwould cast a shadow over the future preservation of price stability at the current short- and long-term interest rates. Second, the realization of theassessments in the financial markets, including the predictions of the private forecasters, that the process of raising the interest rate in the US will continue, and with it the narrowing of the interest differential between the NIS and the dollar, makes it more likely that a change in the NIS interest rate, when it occurs, will be upwards, in order to maintain price stability.Third, global assessments regarding the continued rise in fuel prices-which hitherto has not affected price developments in Israel-introduce an element of uncertainty about domestic prices, and are likely to result in the need for a higher NIS rate of interest than that currently prevailing. The current interest-rate policy supports continued recovery in real activity that is based on overall financial stability and price stability in particular. The backdrop to this is a lower level of real interest, especially short-term, than in the past, and a continued rise in the money supply, which does not augur well for price stability.

Poland,2004-10-27,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 27 October 2004 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 26-27 October 2004 In the period since the last meeting of the Council the appreciation trend of the zloty as well as the low pace of wage growth have been continued while the price effects of Poland's accession to the European Union have been fading away. In consequence, the balance of risks to future inflation points to a rise in the probability of inflation running lower than outlined in the scenario presented in the August Inflation Report. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 6.5% on an annual basis; lombard rate 8.8% on an annual basis; deposit rate 5.0% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 7.0% on an annual basis. The Council maintains its tightening monetary policy bias. New economic data which appeared in the period since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council indicates that in 2005-2006 the world economic growth, the euro area included, will be slightly slower than it has been expected to date. In September and October 2004 the American economy saw a further deterioration of confidence indicators, primarily in response to the rises in crude oil prices in world markets and a lower then expected increase in new jobs. A downturn in sentiment in the enterprise sector was also observed in the euro area. This is especially true of Germany, where pessimistic expectations as to new export orders were reinforced. The hike in the current and forecasted oil prices resulted in a weakening of the outlook for the world economic growth in 2005. Still, there is substantial uncertainty related to the influence of this factor on the economic growth. So far the growth in oil prices in international markets has not exerted a significant influence on the rise of consumer prices in the major economies. Inflation expectations in the euro area remain broadly consistent with the data presented in the August Inflation Report. However, in view of a likely further appreciation of the euro against the dollar, as well as the low dynamics of unit ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, labour costs in the euro area, the probability of inflation settling slightly below the projected path has been raised. The data collected since the last MPC meeting confirms previous expectations that the GDP in Poland will grow annually by 4.5-5.5% in the next two years. According to NBP estimates in 2004 Q3 the growth rate of the GDP amounted to 4.5%. The continually high industrial output dynamics is still being stimulated by high export sales. It can be expected though, that starting from 2005 the role of net exports as a factor contributing to economic growth will be decreasing, while the role of domestic demand in general, and investment demand in particular, will rise. A slim decrease in the unemployment rate is still being observed, even though LFS data for Q2 may indicate some delay in the expected improvement in the labour market. In September 2004 the wage growth slowed down. The preservation of a moderate pace of wage growth accompanied by a high dynamics in labour productivity will result in making inflation decrease faster than it was presented in the August Report. An accurate assessment of the future wage dynamics and the resultant inflationary pressures is made difficult by the considerable uncertainty surrounding the situation in the labour market, especially the difficulties in estimating the natural unemployment rate and the plausible impact that inflation expectations (4.4% in October 2004) may have on wage increases. The available data as well as NBP survey evidence point to a slower than expected recovery in investments. These signals, however, are inconsistent with reports of the high and still rising level of capacity utilisation. This reveals a rise in uncertainty related to the projected dynamics of economic growth in 2004 and 2006. One source of this uncertainty is also the sluggish progress of structural reforms, particularly those of public finances. The dynamics of monetary and credit aggregates has not changed to any significant extent. In September, for the first time this year, a drop in the annual inflation rate (CPI) was recorded from 4.6% to 4.4%. The fall in the current inflation as well as the shrinking gap between CPI and core “net inflation” point to a gradual disappearance of temporary factors which have contributed to inflation growth in the past few months. The zloty has appreciated for the next consecutive month, which was a factor decreasing inflation. Should this tendency be sustained, inflation would run below the path presented in the Report. The possibility of inflation decrease in the first half of 2005 is further supported by the latest food price forecasts, which suggest the diminishing of pro-inflationary shocks in the food market. Current assessment of this year's harvest by the Central Statistical Office (GUS) is more optimistic than the one available at the time the August Report was prepared. A factor of inflationary risk is the persistent rising trend of producer prices in industry (8.0% y/y in September 2004). It is primarily caused by increasing domestic prices, as the appreciation of the zloty brought about a drop in export prices while at the same time it offset the effects of the hike in commodities' prices in world markets. A high and still rising level of capacity utilisation enhances the risk of cost effects translating into the rise of consumer prices. In this situation the Council estimates that although the probability of inflation settling above the target of 2.5% over the monetary policy transmission horizon has been to some extent reduced, it is still higher than the probability of inflation falling under 2.5%. Considering the above, the Council keeps its tightening monetary policy bias. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 23-24 November 2004."
Romania,2004-11-02,"At the meeting on 29 October 2004, the NBR Board reviewed all macroeconomic indicators, including the developments in foreign direct investment and portfolio investments, proceeds from privatisation, current transfers and other capital inflows in the first nine months of 2004. It proved that all segments recorded significantly higher performances, leading to the rise in the forex reserves with the central bank by over EUR 3.5 billion since the beginning of the year, against the background of keeping the balance of payments current account deficit below 6 percent of GDP. Although in recent years imports for the cold season generally caused the foreign exchange surplus to decline, in October 2004, the NBR continued to purchase foreign currency off the forex market, buying another EUR 218.1 million, a fact which, correlated with other data, hints at a structural and sustainable improvement of capital inflows. Considering the new state of affairs, the Board decided to pursue a more flexible exchange rate of the ROL by limiting the interventions of the central bank in the forex market. Moreover, the Board resolved that, from now on, no forecasted spread of real appreciation of the ROL exchange rate would be made public, which invalidates any expectation of an impending depreciation of the domestic currency as a result of the NBR's intervention. The greater flexibility of the exchange rate goes hand in hand with the switch to inflation targeting and the next stages of capital account liberalisation. Given the capital inflows in this period, the ROL may strengthen in real terms, which is indicative of the considerable monetary policy tightening. Such an option is justified by some inflationary pressures caused by the soaring world oil price as well. Behind the larger appreciation of the ROL exchange rate stood the rise in labour productivity across industry and the positive trend towards improved export composition. Monetary policy tightening through stronger real appreciation of the ROL will help bolster disinflation further. As a matter of fact, despite some higher-than-expected price hikes in the past few months, the 12-month consumer price index fell from 14.1 percent in December 2003 to 11.1 percent in September 2004. The NBR Board decided to lower the policy rate by half of a percentage point to 18.25 percent in order to confirm further disinflation. The cut in the nominal policy rate was 3 percentage points in June-October 2004, thus sending the real policy rate back to the level recorded at end-2003. As all aggregate demand components (public and private consumption, gross capital formation and exports) are expected to rise in the period ahead, the NBR Board decided to maintain a cautious monetary policy stance in order to meet the inflation target."
Euroarea,2004-11-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Persistently high and rising oil prices have had a visible direct impact on consumer prices this year, and inflation is likely to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months. This is a worrisome development, but there is no strong indication as yet that medium-term inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area. In particular, wage growth appears to remain limited, in the context of ongoing moderate real GDP growth and weak labour markets. Against this background, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged at their present levels, which are very low by historical standards. However, there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term. Strong vigilance is therefore warranted with regard to all developments which could increase such risks. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. The economic recovery started in the second half of 2003, and we saw positive developments in the first half of 2004. Although short-term indicators have become more mixed, the basic determinants of economic activity remain consistent with continuing economic growth in 2005. On the external side, we see some moderation taking place following a period in which the world economy has experienced its strongest dynamism in many years. Nevertheless, euro area exports should continue to benefit from positive global demand conditions in 2005. On the domestic side, investment should be supported by the global environment, the very favourable financing conditions in the euro area, improved earnings and greater corporate efficiency gained through business restructuring. Furthermore, scope exists in the euro area as a whole for private consumption to strengthen, particularly once labour market prospects improve more visibly. However, this outlook is surrounded by continuing uncertainty, in particular stemming from recent developments in oil markets. On the one hand, the magnitude and nature of this shock differ from earlier experiences, when oil price rises were much stronger and mainly due to supply constraints. In addition, the oil intensity of production is significantly lower in the euro area. On the other hand, recent oil price increases constitute a nonetheless sizeable adverse shock to the euro area economy. If oil prices were to remain at current levels, or even increase further, they would dampen the strength of the recovery both inside and outside the euro area. Under certain conditions, a smoother absorption of the oil price shock can be ensured: in particular, second-round effects in wage and price-setting must continue to be avoided, and fiscal authorities should refrain from taking measures which would prolong the necessary adjustment process. With regard to consumer prices, annual inflation increased to 2.5% in October, according to Eurostat's flash estimate. This was a strong increase, after the decline to 2.1% in September from 2.3% in August, and shows that oil price developments have had a sizeable direct impact on the euro area HICP in recent weeks. Moreover, the oil price shock may feed through the economy and generate further indirect effects, as indicated by developments in producer prices. Looking further ahead, however, the information available so far does not suggest that stronger underlying inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area. Wage increases have remained limited since the last quarter of 2003, and this trend is expected to persist in the context of ongoing moderate growth and weak labour markets. Nevertheless, a number of upward risks to the outlook for price stability have emerged over recent months. Risks are mainly associated with oil price developments, possible renewed increases in indirect taxes and administrative prices, and potential second-round effects stemming from wage and price-setting behaviour. Further indications for the medium-term outlook are provided by the monetary analysis. The downward trend in annual M3 growth in the first half of this year appears to have come to a halt in recent months. The shorter-term dynamics of M3 have strengthened and its annual growth rates are rising. These developments reflect the stimulative effect of the historically low level of interest rates in the euro area on monetary expansion. Demand for the most liquid components of M3 contained in the narrow aggregate M1 is particularly strong. The low level of interest rates is also fuelling private sector demand for credit. In particular, the growth rate of loans for house purchase continues to rise and is now approaching double digits. Yet loan demand is becoming more broadly based, and the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations is also picking up. Given the continued strength of M3 growth over the past few years, there remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth. This could pose inflationary risks in the future if the excess liquidity is not progressively reduced as a result of reverse portfolio shifts. Moreover, persistently high excess liquidity and strong credit growth could become a source of unsustainable asset price increases, particularly in property markets. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that underlying inflationary pressures are still contained, but a number of medium-term upside risks to price stability need to be monitored closely. It is particularly important that these do not affect long-term inflation expectations. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis continues to support the case for strong vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability. In some cases there are encouraging signs that Member States are planning to correct excessive deficits or make progress towards close-to-balance or in-surplus budgetary positions. However, there are other cases where there are significant risks that commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact will not be met, or where imbalances are on the rise and new breaches of the 3% reference value might occur. It is therefore imperative that 2005 budgets prioritise consolidation where this is necessary. Moreover, it is of vital importance that the reliable compilation and timely reporting of government finance statistics are ensured. Appropriate budgetary targets and compliance with fiscal commitments and reporting requirements will help to build confidence, support the economic upswing and prepare for the impact of population ageing. As regards the European fiscal framework, the Governing Council remains convinced that improvements in the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact are possible and would be beneficial. In this regard, the European Commission's proposals for improving the implementation of the preventive arm of the Pact are useful. At the same time, the Governing Council warns against changes to the Pact and, in particular, the excessive deficit procedure. It considers the credibility of the 3% deficit limit essential to anchoring expectations of fiscal discipline. Moreover, strict surveillance and effective peer pressure on national budget policies are indispensable to preserving sound fiscal policies. Finally. I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate the need for progress on structural reform. Fiscal consolidation plans should be part of a structural reform agenda that favours growth, competitiveness and employment. As regards labour and product markets, the mid-term review of the Lisbon agenda  now being prepared for the European Council meeting in March 2005  is a major opportunity to increase momentum in these fields. Structural reforms are crucial to a better performing EU economy, i.e. an economy with higher potential growth, more employment opportunities and greater resilience to shocks. Efforts to accelerate key economic reforms are now more important than ever."
Peru,2004-11-04,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR NOVEMBER 2004 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00% In October, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) decreased 0.02 percent. The cumulative year inflation remained at 3.2 percent for four consecutive months. Core inflation, indicator of the inflationary trend, was 2.4 percent in the January-October period. Transitorily, 12-month inflation is above the upper limit of the target range mainly due to supply shocks in food and fuels during the first semester. The Imported Goods Price Index increased 10.3 percent in the January-October period. The Central Bank forecasts that the 2004 cumulative inflation will be near the upper limit of the target range (3.5 percent), only if fuel and transportation prices do not register increases. For 2005, forecast inflation will be around the mid-point of the target range (2.5 percent) for 2005. The Board of the Central Bank approved to kept the reference interest rates of the monetary operations: The monetary operations regarding injection and withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be made in order to place the interbank interest rate around the center of the corridor set by the reference interest rates (3.00 percent). For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate is kept at 3.75 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate is maintained at 2.25 percent. In case of the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.75 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. For November, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCRP is 200 - 220 million. This average balance is neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it also reflects, among others, seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes. The interest rates for Central Bank's operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP's deposits held abroad. Swaps: the commission is raised to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.75 percent. December Monetary Program will be approved in the Board of Directors meeting of December 9, 2004."
Peru,2004-11-06,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR NOVEMBER 2003 In October, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima rise 0,05 percent. Last 12 month inflation was 1,3 percent, against 2,0 percent in September, whereas the accumulated inflation rate January-October reached 1,74 percent. Core inflation, an indicator which excludes high volatility items from the CPI basket, was nil in October. The average interbank interest rate was 2,71 percent in October, slightly lower than the rate recorded in the previous month (2,77 percent). The monetary policy's decisions are based on inflation forecasts and have like goal to anticipate rise or loss pressures in prices growth. Central Bank´s August inflation report forecasted a 2003 inflation in the bottom limit of the range (1,5 percent) and a 2004 inflation within the lower band of the range (1,5  2,5 percent). The Board of the Bank approved to cut off-auction reference interest rates in 25 basis points. Therefore, the reference interest rates will be as follows: 3,25 percent: for monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchases of BCR's securities. 1,75 percent: for commercial banks' overnight deposits at the BCR. The monetary operations of injection and retirement of liquidity by auctions will be oriented to obtain that the interbank interest rate is in the middle of the range of reference interest rates (2,50 percent). The interest rate for rediscount operations and direct temporary purchase of securities will be the interbank market interest rate, when this one be higher than 3,25 percent. For November, the estimated range for commercial banks' current account balances held at the Central Bank is 170 million to 190 million, on a daily basis. The level of this average balance is not a goal, nor an indicator of the degree of flexibility of the monetary policy, because it reflects additionally seasonal factors and movements in the demand of liquidity. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be the 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission is maintained at an implicit effective annual cost of 3,25 percent."
United States,2004-11-10,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2 percent. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions have improved. Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Thomas M Hoenig; Donald L Kohn; Cathy E Minehan; Mark W Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole.

Chile,2004-11-11,"The Central Bank of Chile Press Release* 11 November 2004 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to raise the monetary policy rate by 25 basis points to 2.25% (annual). The main developments in the domestic economy observed at the time of the last meeting have strengthened, namely subdued inflation and dynamic economic activity. In effect, the growth pace of output and domestic expenditure has increased above forecast in the Monetary Policy Report of last September. Investment has gained additional momentum, export volume growth has increased, while private consumption shows no signs of weakness. In addition, labor market figures have improved. Inflation has remained at low levels, in spite of higher international oil prices. This is particularly apparent in core inflation measures (that exclude some goods with more volatile prices), which continue to show low monthly growth rates and run below previous forecasts. The moderate pace of cost increases, particularly in labor, has contributed to keep inflationary pressures within limits. The Board believes that, despite increased economic dynamism, today's low inflationary pressures and output gap make it possible, in the most likely scenario, to maintain the gradual reduction of the marked monetary impulse at a measured pace. This is consistent with maintaining expected inflation around 3% per annum in the usual policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2004-11-11,"The bank of korea. The Bank of Korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower its target for the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) from 3.5 percent to 3.25 percent for the inter-meeting period. In a related action, the Committee lowered the interest rates on Liquidity Adjustment Loans and Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans of the Bank of Korea by the same 25 basis points, respectively to 3.0 percent and 2.0 percent,. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower its target for the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) from 3.5 percent to 3.25 percent for the inter-meeting period. In a related action, the Committee lowered the interest rates on Liquidity Adjustment Loans and Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans of the Bank of Korea by the same 25 basis points, respectively to 3.0 percent and 2.0 percent. (An unofficial English translation based on the Korean original of the decision on monetary policy taken by the Monetary Policy Committee on November 11, 2004 is attached). In the real economy, private consumption and facilities investment have remained sluggish and both exports and construction investment show a slowdown in the pace of their expansion to some degree. This is giving rise to concern that the downside risk to the growth of the real economy may be increasing. Meanwhile, the current account is still in surplus, mainly thanks to the surplus on the goods account. Although upward pressure on prices from the cost side still exists mainly due to the high oil prices, the core inflation rate remains within its target range owing to the subdued domestic demand. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions have been favorable. However, fund-raising conditions have not improved for small- and medium-sized enterprises with low credit ratings as financial institutions are still acutely sensitive to credit risk. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower its target for the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) from 3.5 percent to 3.25 percent for the inter-meeting period."
Philippines,2004-11-17,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The decision was based on the Monetary Board's assessment that expected trends in output and inflation over the next year or so remain largely unchanged relative to the previous assessment of the monetary stance. Ongoing pressures on consumer prices continue to come primarily from supply-side side factors, notably increases in commodity prices such as food and oil. More importantly, such factors also remain the driving influence of the inflation outlook. These conditions provide a strong argument for leaving policy interest rates at their present levels. This argument is further supported by lingering concerns about the strength of overall demand in the economy, particularly in view of the relatively high unemployment rate and the moderate growth of bank lending. On the other hand, the observed rise in the official and other measures of core inflation suggest the possibility of emerging demand-side effects from ongoing supply shocks. However, such measures are outweighed by other information on demand conditions. The rate of core inflation represents the long-run trend in consumer prices after excluding the impact of temporary shocks to the economy, many of which are often linked to supply-side factors. The official measure of core inflation, which is published by the National Statistics Office (NSO), is defined as CPI inflation after excluding selected food- and energy-related components. Nevertheless, the pattern of rising consumer prices over the past year or so implies a greater risk that the public will come to expect higher inflation in the future, and a greater threat that higher inflation will fuel a self-sustaining rise in expected inflation. Such risks are bolstered by the possibility that the uptrend in commodity prices will persist until 2005, and that renewed exchange market pressure may arise from negative market sentiment concerning the government's fiscal performance. A combination of these factors could pose a threat to the inflation target. In sum, therefore, the economic evidence supports keeping present policy settings unchanged, but also suggests a greater need for readiness to undertake a swift monetary policy action. However, prospective actions aimed at monetary tightening will be oriented primarily towards guiding the public's expectations concerning future inflation. To this end, the BSP continues to watch closely for signs of price pressures arising from the demand side and from inflation expectations. Finally, direct action against supply-side risks remains a key policy priority for authorities. The BSP thus continues to support all possible means of non-monetary intervention in the importation, distribution and delivery of goods and services."
Nigeria,2004-11-20,"PRESS RELEASE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA. COMMUNIQUE NO. 40 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. IN NOVEMBER, 2004 The Monetary Policy Committee of the CBN held its 187th meeting on November 22, 2004 and agreed not to take any new policy action. Price developments since the last meeting of the MPC indicated that both the 12-month moving average and the year-on-year inflation rates had moderated. The 12-month moving average inflation rate decelerated from 191 per cent in August 2004 to 182 per cent in September 2004. The year- on-year inflation rate decelerated significantly to 91 per cent in September 2004 from 130 per cent in the preceding month reflecting the moderation in prices of all items less farm produce and energy. The exchange rate of the naira remained relatively stable in the Dutch Auction System of the foreign exchange market, while the gross official reserves increased further to US $1472 billion from US $1327 billion at end-September 2004. Broad money stock (M ) increased by 129 per cent during the first ten months of 2004. This represented an annualised growth rate of 155 per cent, which compared with the 160 per cent target for 2004. In addition, credit (net) to government declined further in the first ten months of 2004, while credit to the private sector rose by 258 per cent as against the 220 per cent target for 2004. The Committee remained positive about the outlook for the rest of the year. It expects the external reserves to rise further owing to a projected increase in demand for Nigeria's crude oil exports in the remaining months of 2004. The Committee also expects that with a continuation of current prudent fiscal operations, the money supply would stay within its programmed target and that the inflation rate would moderate further during the rest of the year. Against this background, the Committee decided not to take any new policy action, but agreed to monitor macroeconomic developments very closely, with a view to fine tuning existing policies if the need arises.

Israel,2004-11-22,"22.11.2004 The Bank of Israel's Interest Rate for December 2004 The Bank ofIsrael today announced that in the context of its monetary program for December 2004, the interest rate will be reduced by 0.2 of a percentage point,to 3.9 percent. The decision to lower the interest rate is based on the Bank's assessment thatthe cumulative economic developments in the last few months indicate that it may be possible to continue maintaining price stability at a lower interest rate than that prevailing hitherto. This is consistent with the Bank ofIsrael's policy of supporting the continued recovery in real activity at the lowest possible short-term interest rate by preserving price stability, thereby contributing to financial stability. Several developments that occurred in the last few months, since the Bank of Israel's interest rate was first reduced to 4.1 percent, indicate that Israel's economy may currently be in a situation in which price stability can be maintained at a lower rate of interest: Inflation: Although assessments of inflation twelve months forward: bothinflation expectations derived from the capital market and predictions of private forecasters: have been at the center of the price-stability target for several months, the CPIs published in the last few months indicate monthly price rises close to zero. Furthermore, according to the forecasters this situation is expected to persist in the coming months. It thus seems that the picture that emerges within a one-year horizon is one in whichalthough the forecast price increases are likely to take place, this will not be in the near future. It should be noted with regard to prices that real activity continues to recover, but the current slower rate of recovery means weaker pressure on prices. The changesin the public's financial asset portfolio also shows that the public is not concerned about the possibility of continued price rises, and this is reflected by the persistent decline in the share of CPI-indexed assets, and by the absence of a tendency to increase the share of exchange-rate-indexed investments. The foreign currency market: The assessment is becoming more firm that with thesteady narrowing of the interest differential between the NIS and the dollar, which is expected to continue, in the present circumstances the economycan cope with smaller interest-rate differentials than in the past withoutcausing a deviation from the path of price stability. Moreover, the narrowing of the interest-rate differentials has until now not been reflected by the behavior of the exchange rate, which is currently affected mainly by the worldwide weakness of the dollar. The various indicators derived from thefinancial markets point to the possibility that the contraction of the interest-rate differentials will eventually be expressed by a certain rise in the exchange rate, but not in the near future. In this context it is relevant to note that for some time the economy has benefited from long-term capital inflow of about $ 4-5 billion a year, and it appears that this is likely to continue in the future. The foreign currency market has been operatingfor a while at low bid-offer spreads, with low volatility, and at a relatively low volume of trade. Fiscal policy: The slow persistent decline in yields in the Treasury-bill and government-bond markets shows that the financial markets continue to consider the long-term fiscal discipline adopted by the government: expressed by the budget targets for 2005 and thereafter: as credible. In this context it is essential for the Knesset to pass the 2005 budget, along the lines confirmed by the government, without delay, and thus remove the uncertainty that still lingers in this area. The government must take special steps to boost economic growth. Heading the list is organizing priorities so that infrastructure investment moves up the scale. In this way the government would support investment in the economy in general, and in particular would help the construction industry, whose growth isstill lagging behind that in other principal industries. In addition, the structural changes in the capital market recommended by the Bachar Committee and confirmed by the government must be implemented. This would ease the financing constraint of long-term investments and would complement the policy of speeding up the rate of infrastructure investment. The Bank will continue to monitor closely world wide developments in exchange rates and capital flows into and out of Israel. These, together with the preservation of the credibility of fiscal discipline, could affect the Bank'sability to keep short-term interest rates low to encourage growth while maintaining price stability. The risk premium, as measured by the 5-year credit-default-swap (CDS) market was about 41 basis points in November, compared to 45 basis points a month earlier. The yield spread between 10-year Shahar bonds and 10-year US government bonds. The Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve is due to convene on 14 December 2004 for its regular review of interest-rate policy. Table 3: Central-Bank Interest Rates in Several Countries.

Romania,2004-11-22,"During its meeting on 18 November 2004, the NBR Board reviewed the latest developments in all macroeconomic indicators and the prospects for the period ahead. In this context, the decision to pursue a policy stance favouring a more flexible ROL exchange rate was seen as the main contributor to an upsurge in volumes traded on the forex market and much larger swings of the ROL rate. Board members have conceded that as a result of Romania's rating being upgraded to investment grade foreign direct investment and portfolio investments will increase, thereby leading to a sharper appreciation trend of the domestic currency amid further market-induced swings in the ROL exchange rate. This pinpoints a continued tightening of monetary policy, which helps disinflation to carry on. The 12-month consumer price index dropped to 10.8 percent in October 2004 and is seen falling at a faster rate in the final two months of the year. In order for the disinflation trend to be validated, the NBR Board decided to cut the policy rate by half of a percentage point to 17.75 percent. Taking into account the upward trend in aggregate demand for the period ahead and the adjustment of some administered prices in early 2005, the NBR Board decided to retain the cautious monetary policy stance in order to meet the inflation target, even in the long run."
Poland,2004-11-24,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 24th November 2004 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 23-24 November 2004. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 6.5% on an annual basis; lombard rate 8.0% on an annual basis; deposit rate 5.0% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 7.0% on an annual basis. The Council maintains its tightening monetary policy bias. Over the period since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council the outlook for the world economy has not changed significantly. In October the influence of high crude oil prices on inflation and economic growth in main world economies became more visible than in the previous months. The annual rates of growth of consumer prices rose from 2.5% in September to 3.2% in October in the USA and from 2.1% to 2.4% in the euro-zone. At the same time the data on GDP growth in 2004 Q3 in the USA, the euro-zone and Japan proved substantially lower than expected. Additionally, the euro-zone saw deterioration in economic sentiment of enterprises and households alike, which mainly resulted from the appreciation of the euro against the US dollar and the lack of improvement in the labour market. In November the prices of oil in the world markets recorded a significant decline, however, at present it is difficult to assess how sustainable these developments are. According to NBP estimates. GDP growth rate in Poland in 2004 Q3 stood somewhat below 5% and the total value added in Q3 was larger than a year before by 4.5%. What contributed most to the economic growth were the stable consumption dynamics and positive net exports. According to available information investment dynamics were lower than previously expected. Available data do not, as yet, indicate that the positive tendencies in the labour market will be sustained. Although the number of unemployed has further been decreasing, no substantial increase in employment has been recorded. In October the decline in real wages in the corporate sector became stronger. So far, the labour market has not seen the second-round effects of considerably higher inflation expectations, which started to rise in July 2004. It should be noted that in November there was some decrease in inflation expectations (from 4.4% in October to 4.0%). The inflation rate, higher than the inflation target, primarily reflects price increases associated with Poland's EU accession and hikes in commodities prices in world markets, which is confirmed by the still low core inflation index (2.4% in October 2004). Other core inflation indices stabilized close to levels recorded in September. The persistently high growth rate of producer prices in industry (7.7% y/y) mainly stemmed from a rise in domestic prices as the appreciation of the zloty resulted in a reduction of export prices. Similarly to the previous months, because of a high level of production capacity utilisation, there is still a risk of cost effects feeding through into a rise in consumer prices. The zloty has been appreciating strongly for the next consecutive month. Significant strengthening of the zloty is conducive to inflation decrease. If this trend persists, it will negatively affect economic growth over the monetary policy transmission horizon. According to the inflation projection presented in the Inflation Report to be published on 30 November 2004, the GDP growth rate in the next two years is expected to stand somewhat lower than 4.5-5.5% forecasted in August. Starting from 2005 the contribution of net exports to the economic growth will diminish - among others, as a consequence of real appreciation of the zloty - while the contribution of investment will rise. The slightly lower than predicted in the August Inflation Report rate of economic growth in 2005-2006 mainly results from a now less optimistic outlook for investment dynamics in this period. In the Council's opinion, in the longer term the sustainability of the economic revival will hinge on the implementation of public finance reforms. The lack of necessary reforms may lead to consecutive prudential thresholds of public debt to GDP being surpassed and result in considerably higher risk premium for investing in Poland. This may  through the depreciation of the zloty  be a source of additional inflationary pressure. The path of future inflation presented in the inflation projection to be published in the November Inflation Report is lower than the one shown in the previous Report. According to the projection, assuming there is no change in the interest rates, with the 50% probability the inflation rate will remain in the range between 2.5% and 5.2% in 2005 Q4 and between 1.3% and 4.8% in 2006 Q4 (in the August projection the values were 2.8%-5.5% and 1.6%-5.1% for 2005 Q4 and 2006 Q4, respectively). The uncertainty surrounding the central projection is highly asymmetric in 2005 and thus points to a higher probability of inflation running above the central projection. The asymmetry disappears in 2006. In the Council's opinion the latest economic data indicate that the balance of risks for future inflation is more favourable than presented in the November inflation projection. This assessment is informed by the sustained strong appreciation of the zloty, however, the Council recognises the uncertainty surrounding the persistence of this trend. The second factor affecting the assessment is the lack of excessive wage growth, which points to limited second- round effects. Nevertheless, the probability of inflation staying above the target of 2.5% over the monetary policy transmission horizon remains higher than the probability of the inflation falling below target. The Council has decided to keep its tightening monetary policy bias. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 14-15 December 2004."

Malaysia,2004-11-30,"The Malaysian economy expanded at an annual rate of 6.8% in the third quarter of 2004, raising the real GDP growth in the first three quarters of 2004 to 7.6%. Growth was supported by strong expansion in private sector demand, both consumption and investment, and continued expansion in exports. Going forward, the economic outlook for Malaysia remains favourable. The export sector is expected to continue to support growth in an environment of greater resilience of the world economy to higher oil prices and amidst expectations for a moderation in global demand for IT products. On the domestic front, private sector demand is expected to be supported by rising disposable incomes, positive investor sentiment, stable employment conditions, favourable commodity prices and improved earnings of the corporate sector. The expansion of the Malaysian economy continues to be well supported by strong underlying fundamentals. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, rose at an annual rate of 1.6% in the period July to October 2004, reflecting the impact of higher transportation charges following the increase in retail petrol prices and the impact of higher taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, inflation is expected to average at or below 1.5% in 2004 (January  October: 1.2%). The continued improvements in productivity growth, a more competitive environment and adequate expansion in capacity are factors that will reduce the inflation risk for Malaysia. The current stance of monetary policy will therefore be maintained to support growth. The overnight policy rate will continue to remain unchanged at the current level of 2.70%.

Euroarea,2004-12-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. All in all, the short-term outlook for inflation remains worrisome, but our assessment of price developments over the medium term is unchanged. At the current juncture oil price developments are having a sizeable impact on consumer prices in the euro area, while there is no significant evidence that stronger underlying domestic inflationary pressures are building up. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged at their historically low levels. At the same time, we recognise the existence of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. Continued vigilance is of the essence with regard to those risks. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. After the positive developments in the first half of 2004, economic growth has moderated in the second half. In the third quarter of the year, real GDP growth is estimated to have been only 0.3% quarter on quarter, after 0.7% and 0.5% in the previous two quarters. According to Eurostat, the contribution of net exports turned negative, reflecting in particular high import growth, and private consumption was subdued, probably dampened by higher oil prices. At the same time, investment growth increased and inventories were built up. The available survey information for October and November points to ongoing growth in the fourth quarter, albeit at a more moderate pace than in the first half of this year. The conditions remain in place for economic growth to proceed. On the external side, while global growth is showing some signs of moderation, it nonetheless is expected to remain robust. Euro area exports should continue to benefit from global demand conditions. On the domestic side, investment should be supported further by the very favourable financing conditions in the euro area, improved earnings and greater corporate efficiency gained through business restructuring. Finally, scope exists for private consumption to strengthen, particularly if uncertainties surrounding the extent and pace of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms are reduced. Accordingly, we expect a gradual recovery in euro area activity over the next two years, with somewhat more moderate growth rates due to the impact of oil prices. Euro area real GDP growth is projected to be between 1.6% and 2.0% on average in 2004, between 1.4% and 2.4% in 2005 and between 1.7% and 2.7% in 2006. Available forecasts from international and private sector organisations convey a broadly similar picture. Downside risks to these projections stem in particular from potentially unfavourable developments in the oil market. In order to limit such risks, second-round effects in wage and price-setting must be avoided and fiscal authorities should refrain from taking measures which would prolong or distort the necessary adjustment process. Moreover, the degree of competition in the euro area energy sector is an important factor in allowing higher oil prices to be absorbed without significant distortions. Further progress in increasing competition in this sector would be highly beneficial. Turning to consumer prices, annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in November, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, down from 2.4% in October. Over the coming months, inflation rates of above 2% are likely to persist, and some temporary further increase from current levels cannot be excluded. Looking further ahead, however, the information available so far indicates that HICP inflation would fall below 2% in the course of 2005 if no further adverse shocks occurred and it does not suggest that stronger underlying inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area. Wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and, in the context of ongoing moderate growth and weak labour markets, this trend should continue in the future. Producer prices are rising, but this remains concentrated on energy and intermediate goods, which should limit the pass-through. These views are also embodied in the Eurosystem staff projections. Average annual HICP inflation is projected to lie between 2.1% and 2.3% in 2004. As the impact of recent oil price increases and the effects of previous indirect tax and administered price rises gradually dissipate, annual HICP inflation is projected to be between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2005 and 1.0% and 2.2% in 2006. These projections are broadly consistent with forecasts recently released by international and private sector organisations. Concerns relate in particular to future oil price developments and, more generally, to the potential risk of second-round effects in wage and price-setting throughout the economy. Further developments in indirect taxes and administered prices also need to be monitored closely. Further insight into the outlook for price developments, at medium to longer-term horizons, is provided by the monetary analysis. The latest monetary data confirm that the downward trend in annual M3 growth observed from the middle of 2003 has not continued in recent months and has even reversed. Over the course of 2004, monetary dynamics have been driven by two opposing forces. On the one hand, the historically very low level of interest rates in the euro area has stimulated M3 dynamics, in particular demand for the most liquid components of M3 contained in the narrow aggregate M1. On the other hand, portfolio allocation behaviour has tended to normalise over the past year following the exceptionally strong preference for liquidity observed during the period of heightened economic and financial uncertainty between 2001 and mid-2003. However, investors' preference for liquid assets seems to have remained greater than would typically be expected at the current stage of the economic cycle, possibly due to the fact that the economic and financial uncertainties in recent years have been relatively strong and protracted. The very low level of interest rates is also fuelling private sector demand for credit. In particular, the demand for loans for house purchase has continued to be robust, supported also by strong house price dynamics in several euro area countries. Growth in loans to non-financial corporations has picked up further in recent months. As a result of the persistently high growth in M3 over the past few years, there remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary economic growth. This could pose risks to price stability over the medium term. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that underlying domestic inflationary pressures are contained, but a number of medium-term upside risks to price stability need to be monitored closely. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability over the medium term. It is of the essence to avoid any spillover from short-term consumer price developments to long-term inflation expectations. As regards fiscal policies, forthcoming budgets and stability programmes should send strong and confidence-building signals, namely that sound public finances and growth-friendly structural adjustments in public finances are being pursued. Concerning the European institutional framework, the Stability and Growth Pact and the excessive deficit procedure are the key fiscal cornerstones of EMU. These must remain firm. The Pact and the excessive deficit procedure should be fully respected in their current form, while their implementation could be improved, in particular as regards the preventive arm of the Pact. Finally, let me support the calls expressed in the report of the High Level Group chaired by Wim Kok to renew the impetus in the Lisbon process and to sharpen its focus. In this context, we restate our strong support for all efforts on the part of governments, parliaments and social partners implementing the reform agenda and focusing on those reforms that will support employment growth, foster investment and stimulate innovation and productivity. Progress in this direction will not only enhance the underlying growth potential of the euro area economy over the medium term but will also help to bolster consumer and business confidence over a shorter horizon."
Peru,2004-12-04,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR DECEMBER 2003 In November, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima rise 0,17 percent. Last 12 month inflation was 1,88 percent, against 1,30 percent in October. Core inflation, an indicator which excludes high volatility items from the CPI basket, was 0,20 percent in November and 0,31 percent through last 12 month The average interbank interest rate was 2,56 percent in November, lower than the rate recorded in the previous month (2,71 percent), like result of the reduction of the reference interest rates of the Central Bank in November (25 basis points). The monetary policy's decisions are based on inflation forecasts and have like goal to anticipate rise or loss pressures in prices growth. Central Bank´s August inflation report forecasted a 2004 inflation within the lower band of the range (1,5  2,5 percent). The Board of the Bank approved to maintain borrowing and lending interest rates for Central Bank operations at: 3,25 percent: for monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchases of BCR's securities. 1,75 percent: for commercial banks' overnight deposits at the BCR. The monetary operations of injection and retirement of liquidity by auctions will be oriented to obtain that the interbank interest rate is in the middle of the range of reference interest rates (2,50 percent). The interest rate for rediscount operations and direct temporary purchase of securities will be the interbank market interest rate, when this one be higher than 3,25 percent. For December, the estimated range for commercial banks' current account balances held at the Central Bank is 180 million to 200 million, on a daily basis. The level of this average balance is not a goal, nor an indicator of the degree of flexibility of the monetary policy, because it reflects additionally seasonal factors and movements in the demand of liquidity. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be the 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission is maintained at an implicit effective annual cost of 3,25 percent."
Chile,2004-12-09,"The Central Bank of Chile Press Release* 9 December 2004 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, with the vote of four of its members, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.25% (annual). The minority vote was for increasing the interest rate by 25 basis points. Since the last meeting, output and expenditure have maintained their stronger dynamism in comparison to forecast in the last Monetary Policy Report, despite the effects caused by the difference in October's number of working days in economic activity indicators. Investment continues to grow at a fast pace, and consumption indicators maintain a positive tone. Furthermore, private expectations and job creation have improved. The various indicators of the inflation trend have increased from very low levels and CPI inflation has returned to the target range of 2%-4% per year. Core inflation measures (that exclude some goods with more volatile prices) have increased gradually, approaching projections in September's Monetary Policy Report, while costs remain subdued. The Board reiterates that, in the most likely scenario, it will continue to reduce the present marked monetary impulse at a measured pace, in order to maintain annual expected inflation centered around 3% in the usual policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2004-12-09,"The bank of korea. The Bank of Korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.25%) for the intermeeting period. (An unofficial English translation based on the Korean original of the decision on monetary policy taken by the Monetary Policy Committee on December 9, 2004 is attached). In the real economy, exports continue to exhibit robust growth, whereas construction investment shows a slowdown in its pace of expansion and private consumption and facilities investment remain sluggish. Meanwhile, the current account sustains a surplus, reflecting that on the goods account. Prices maintain their overall stability, as upward pressure from the demand side has been mild, oil prices have declined to some extent, and the Korean won has appreciated against the U.S, dollar. The situation, though, still calls for caution since an upward adjustment of charges for some public goods and services is scheduled and the medium-term evolution of oil prices is still unclear. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions have been favorable, yet lending activities of financial institutions including loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises remain dull as sensitivity to credit risk has increased. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.25 percent) for the intermeeting period."
Peru,2004-12-09,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR DECEMBER 2004 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00% In November, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.29 percent mainly due to the rise in urban transportation (0.13 percentage points), fuels (0.15 percentage points) and electric tariffs (0.16 percentage points). The cumulative year inflation is 3.49 percent. Excluding the higher urban transportation fares the monthly inflation would have being 0.16 percent in November and 3.24 percent in January-November. Additionally, if we exclude the increase in fuels, the November inflation would have being 0.01 percent and 2.37 percent in the January-November period. Core inflation, indicator of the inflationary trend, was 2.59 percent in that period. Transitorily, 12-month inflation is above the upper limit of the target range mainly due to supply shocks in food and fuels. The Imported Goods Price Index increased 11.5 percent in the January-November period, while the Domestic Goods Price Index rose 2.26 percent. Due to these transitory factors, the Central Bank forecasted in the August Inflation Report that the 2004 cumulative inflation will be near the upper limit of the target range. For 2005, forecast inflation will be around the mid-point of the target range (2.5 percent). The Board of the Central Bank approved to kept the reference interest rates of the monetary operations: The monetary operations regarding injection and withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be made in order to place the interbank interest rate around the center of the corridor set by the reference interest rates (3.00 percent). For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate is kept at 3.75 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate is maintained at 2.25 percent. In case of the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.75 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. For December, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCRP is 230 - 250 million. This average balance is neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it also reflects, among others, seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes. The interest rates for Central Bank's operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP's deposits held abroad. Swaps: the commission is maintained to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.75 percent. Next Monetary Program will be approved in the Board of Directors meeting of January 6, 2005."
South Africa,2004-12-09,"Revised national accounts statistics released by Statistics South Africa show that growth in real gross domestic product continued to gather momentum during the course of 2004 and reached a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 5½ per cent in the third quarter of the year. This good performance of domestic production was supported by relatively buoyant global economic conditions, an improvement in South Africa's terms of trade, rising export volumes and strong domestic demand. Even more significant is that the acceleration in economic growth was accompanied by an increase of roughly 196 000 jobs in the formal non-agricultural sectors in the twelve months up to June 2004 and without any meaningful pressure on domestic prices. In fact. CPIX inflation has remained within the inflation target range of between 3 and 6 per cent for the past 14 months. The twelve-month rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost of mortgage bonds (the CPIX) moved into the target range in September 2003. This was accomplished largely owing to persistent monetary and fiscal discipline applied by the authorities, the benefits that are accruing as a result of microeconomic reforms, the appreciation in the external value of the rand, and moderate increases in food prices. CPIX inflation receded further from 5,4 per cent in September to 4.0 per cent in December 2003. Mainly as a consequence of a rise in petrol and diesel prices, twelve-month CPIX inflation increased to 5,0 per cent in June 2004, before declining to 3,7 per cent in September. Increases in transport running costs were responsible for a somewhat higher CPIX inflation figure of 4,2 per cent in October 2004. If petrol and diesel prices are excluded from the CPIX index, the rate of increase over twelve months in the prices of other consumer goods and services declined from 5,7 per cent in September 2003 to 3,5 per cent in October 2004. As could be expected with the appreciation in the external value of the rand, disinflation in the prices of consumer goods made the largest contribution to the improved inflation outcome in South Africa. Despite the effect of changes in international oil prices, the twelve-month rate of increase in the prices of consumer goods was below the lower limit of 3 per cent of the inflation target in 8 of the 14 months up to October 2004. Increases in petrol and diesel prices mainly brought about higher increases in the other months. The prices of certain consumer goods such as those of furniture and equipment, clothing and footwear and vehicles actually declined over the twelve months up to October 2004. However, the prices of alcoholic beverages, tobacco and transport running costs continued to rise at rates considerably above the upper limit of the inflation target of 6 per cent. The twelve-month rate of increase in the prices of consumer services consistently remained above the upper limit of the inflation target. These prices are not directly affected by changes in the external value of the rand and normally take longer to adjust to changed circumstances. The rate of increase in these prices nevertheless also slowed down significantly in 2004. Measured over a period of twelve months, the rate of increase in the prices of consumer services included in the CPIX declined from a peak of 8,6 per cent in September 2003 to 6,3 per cent in October 2004. The effect of the stronger rand on the prices of goods is clearly illustrated by developments in the prices of imported goods included in producer prices. The prices of these goods measured over a period of one year started to decrease from April 2003 and continued declining up to October 2004. These cheaper imports enabled domestic producers to moderate price increases. As a result, the rate of increase in the prices of domestically produced goods amounted to only 2,7 per cent for the year ended October 2004. The inflation outlook generally remains positive, but there are certain developments that will have to be monitored closely by the Monetary Policy Committee to ensure that inflation remains within the target range. Of particular significance for the continuance of inflation within the target range are the lower inflation expectations. Inflation expectations are very prominent in the inflation process. The recent lower inflation expectations recorded by the Bureau for Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch, which fell within the inflation target range for the second consecutive quarter, clearly illustrate the improved credibility of monetary policy. These levels of expectations are also an important signal that inflation could remain at low levels. As already noted, the strength of the rand has been an important factor contributing to bringing inflation down in South Africa and countering the effects of the increase in international oil prices on domestic costs. Although the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments has increased considerably during the course of 2004, this shortfall has been comfortably financed by an inflow of funds from the rest of the world. This clearly reflects the confidence of non-residents in the performance of our economy. At the same time domestic expenditure on goods and services has continued to rise rapidly. All the main expenditure aggregates contributed to this growth, but the rates of increase in expenditure on durable consumer goods and fixed capital formation were high. Both these expenditure components have a high import content. The growth in the world economy has contributed to the increase in the volume of South African exports as well as the improvement in the terms of trade, which have to some extent offset the rise in imports. The International Monetary Fund expects global economic growth to be around 5 per cent in 2004, followed by a slower but still relatively high rate of 4 per cent in 2005. This should support the growth in South African exports and alleviate pressures on the balance of payments that could arise from the additional imports which may be engendered by further increases in domestic demand. According to projections by the International Monetary Fund, global inflation could decline marginally from 3,8 per cent in 2004 to 3,6 per cent in 2005. Countries where inflation has started to rise during 2004, such as the United States of America and the newly industrialised countries in Asia, have already taken corrective steps to prevent any further acceleration. Moreover, the recent substantial increase in international oil prices seems to have levelled off in November. The price of Brent crude oil that averaged US$49 per barrel in October 2004 and at one stage during the month reached US$52 per barrel, declined to an average of US$43,45 per barrel in November. However, the oil market is still very nervous, as clearly illustrated by daily fluctuations in prices. The low rates of increase in other international prices should nevertheless contribute to the containment of domestic inflation. After recovering in 2002 and 2003, the rand has performed more steadily for much of 2004, with reduced volatility helped by the progress which the Bank has made in strengthening the official foreign exchange reserves. Towards the end of this year, the rand has strengthened further. These latest developments reflect a generalised weakening in the US Dollar; hence other currencies, including those of some of South Africa's main trading partners, have experienced similar movements. The weakening in the dollar appears to be part of a process of adjustment in international imbalances. How far this adjustment will run in the months ahead is unclear. The monetary policy stance in South Africa will continue to focus on maintaining inflation within the target range, and to that end, will need to weigh, amongst other things, the sustainability of recent movements in the rand, the impact such movements may have on the medium-term outlook for inflation, and the desirability of a competitive and stable exchange rate for the rand. Other factors that could assist the monetary authority in maintaining inflation within the inflation target range include the commitment by the public authorities to low administered price increases and a generally favourable outlook for food prices despite the drought in certain parts of the country. In addition, the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement shows a continued determination by the government to maintain fiscal prudence. The economy will nonetheless have to be managed carefully to maintain price stability. It is in particular very important that capacity constraints be prevented as far as possible. The recent narrowing and perhaps even future disappearance of the gap between potential and actual output could lead to inflationary pressures. The economy is still operating below full capacity, but there are some signs that capacity constraints are starting to appear. Shortages in the domestic production of cement, other building materials and human resources required by the construction sector are examples in this regard. The utilisation of manufacturing production capacity has also increased. Fortunately, domestic fixed capital formation is rising rapidly and decisions have been made by the relevant authorities to upscale the skills development endeavour in the country. Other developments indicating that it may become more difficult to maintain low inflation, include:. The decline in the growth of labour productivity from a year-on-year rate of 3,3 per cent in the first quarter of 2004 to 0,5 per cent in the second quarter. This decrease was due to an increase in formal non-agricultural employment without a concomitant rise in production, as well as a rise in the number of workdays lost as a result of strikes and other forms of industrial action. With the nominal remuneration per worker rising at 7,6 per cent in the year to the second quarter of 2004, it is important that labour productivity rises. These developments caused the year-on-year rate of increase in nominal unit labour cost to rise further from 5,4 per cent in the first quarter of 2004 to 7,1 per cent in the second quarter. The recent strong growth in the broadly defined money supply (M3) from a year-on-year rate of 11,8 per cent in June 2004 to 14,9 per cent in October. The increase in M3 deposits over these four months was concentrated in the short and medium-term deposits of the corporate sector and largely reflected the reduced opportunity cost of holding such deposits and the robust growth in domestic expenditure and production. As a result, the rate of increase in the narrower monetary aggregates exceeded the increase in M3. Such growth in monetary aggregates, if maintained, is usually a signal that the rate of inflation could increase over time. The acceleration in the twelve-month growth rate in total loans and advances of banks to the private sector from 8.9 per cent in June 2004 to 15.1 per cent in October. Asset-backed credit was mainly responsible for this increase, but in September and October overdrafts, credit cards and general advances started to rise significantly. The increase in the total loans and advances of banks was more or less evenly distributed between the household and corporate sectors over the past four months. Although the outstanding debt of households and the corporate sector is still low, the pace of acceleration in bank credit extension needs to be carefully monitored. Notwithstanding these signals that inflation could perhaps build up over time, our projections show that with an unchanged monetary policy stance. CPIX inflation will probably not breach the upper 6 per cent of the inflation target during the forecast period up to the end of 2006. The further strengthening of the rand over the past two months and the decline in international oil prices in November resulted in a somewhat lower projected inflation path than that published in the Monetary Policy Review in November 2004. Inflation should rise somewhat during the course of 2005, but the upper turning point in the third quarter of that year is now expected to be somewhat lower than that forecast previously. In 2006. CPIX inflation is expected to be comfortably within the target range. Taking the above developments into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to maintain the current monetary policy stance and to keep the repo rate unchanged at 7,50 per cent per annum. As always the Committee will remain vigilant and will stand ready to adjust the repo rate if the inflation outlook changes."
United States,2004-12-14,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2-1/4 percent. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the earlier rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Thomas M Hoenig; Donald L Kohn; Cathy E Minehan; Mark W Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 3-1/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston. New York. Philadelphia. Cleveland. Richmond. Atlanta. Chicago. St. Louis. Minneapolis. Kansas City. Dallas, and San Francisco. In addition, the Committee unanimously decided to expedite the release of its minutes. Beginning with this meeting, the minutes of regularly scheduled meetings will be released three weeks after the date of the policy decision. The first set of expedited minutes will be released at 2 p.m."
Philippines,2004-12-15,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The decision was based on the Monetary Board's assessment that, despite the recent higher outturns, the medium-term outlook for inflation remains essentially unchanged. The overall pattern of price data remains consistent with the assessment that ongoing pressures on inflation remain tied to supply-side influences, and the likely path of future inflation will be hump-shaped. BSP forecasts indicate that average inflation will exceed the 4.0-5.0 percent inflation target for both 2004 and 2005 but should ease back to 4.0-5.0 percent by 2006. During the discussion, the Monetary Board noted some recent positive developments in the inflation environment. For example, easing conditions in world energy markets have already led to a downward shift in monetary authorities' expected inflation path, particularly in the months leading to 2006. In addition, direct policy action against supply-side risks, particularly those undertaken by government agencies such as the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), appears to have produced notable gains in the form of easing in food prices recently. The members of the Monetary Board were of the view that such measures should remain a key policy priority for the BSP and the economic agencies. They also stressed that all potential avenues for non-monetary intervention in the supply and delivery of affected commodities should continue to be pursued in the near term by the concerned government agencies. In addition, the government may also explore ways to encourage price restraint among producers of food and non-food commodities as well as those engaged in providing services such as educational and other services. At the same time, authorities noted that overall output conditions continue to indicate a slack in the economy. Growth in domestic demand, as evidenced by strong consumption spending, rising energy sales and increased merchandise trade activity, continues to be accompanied by sizeable unemployment and moderate lending activity. The outlook for economic activity is also partly dampened by signs of reduced business optimism, as shown in the recent BSP Business Expectations Survey. On balance, therefore, the risks to output conditions appear to lean slightly toward the downside, a view supported by the expected output effects of recent weather disturbances. Looking back over the past year, the Monetary Board believes that the BSP's monetary policy stance has remained appropriate to evolving macroeconomic conditions throughout the period and firmly focused on ensuring price stability over the medium term and providing support to economic growth. The Members of the Monetary Board noted that, had policy rates been raised in the preceding months, the resulting tightening of monetary conditions would have adversely affected market interest rates, corporate investment spending, and overall demand which could have exerted a contractionary impact on economic growth. Nevertheless, the risk of demand-side effects from ongoing supply shocks could still increase in the very near term, and therefore merits close attention. For example, the expected further rise in inflation through early next year could impact adversely on inflation expectations. This underscores the need to avoid any spillover from short-term price developments to inflation expectations over the policy horizon. Thus, the BSP will continue to monitor closely price developments and other indicators bearing on the public's overall inflation expectations."
Poland,2004-12-15,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 15th December 2004 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 14-15 December 2004 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 6.5% on an annual basis; lombard rate 8.0% on an annual basis; deposit rate 5.0% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 7.0% on an annual basis. The Council maintains its tightening monetary policy bias. Over the period since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council the assessment of the outlook for the world economy has not changed significantly. The indicators of economic activity in manufacturing and services as well as business confidence in the United States slightly improved. The euro-zone saw deterioration in economic sentiment of enterprises, which mainly resulted from the appreciation of the euro against the US dollar and the lack of improvement in the labour market. As a result of the still persisting high crude oil prices and the euro appreciation the main international analytical centres slightly adjusted downwards their forecasts of economic growth in the euro-zone. Although in December oil prices in world markets were further decreasing, it is difficult to assess the sustainability of these developments. According to GUS data. GDP growth rate in Poland in 2004 Q3 stood at 4.8% (in comparison with 6.1% in 2004 Q2) and was in line with the assessment presented in the November Inflation Report. However, the composition of GDP growth was different than expected. Individual consumption growth was somewhat lower, both in comparison with the previous quarters and as compared with the NBP estimates. The growth rate of gross fixed capital formation increased (4.1% in 2004 Q3, as compared with 3.6% in 2004 Q2), but this increase was markedly lower than expected in the Inflation Report. Very high dynamics in inventories growth was observed for the third consecutive quarter. Contribution of this factor to GDP growth amounted to 1.5 pp. (in comparison with 1.6 pp. in 2004 Q2). Such a high share of inventories growth in GDP growth together with accompanying lower than expected investment dynamics make the assessment of the outlook for economic growth difficult. The contribution of net exports to GDP growth decreased significantly as compared with the previous quarters. Overall, it is difficult to assess the extent to which GDP data for 2004 Q3 change the balance of risks (that is the composition of factors influencing future inflation) presented in the November Inflation Report. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. Available data do not, as yet, indicate that the positive tendencies in the labour market will be sustained. Although according to preliminary information in November the unemployment rate stood at approximately the same level as in October, still no rise in employment in the corporate sector was observed. In November 2004 the growth of real wage in the corporate sector remained negative (-1.7% y/y in comparison to -2.0% y/y in the previous month). Inflation expectations, which have been higher since July, still have not translated into wage dynamics (no second-round effects observed). The annual inflation rate in November 2004 was 4.5%. The inflation rate, higher than the inflation target, is primarily the effect of price increases associated with Poland's EU accession and the hike in the commodities' prices in world markets. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council a proposal was put forth to change indirect tax rates. NBP estimates based on available data indicate that as a result of these changes the consumer price index may show a one-off increase, which may extend the process of lowering inflation in 2005-2006. The tendency of zloty appreciation, observed in previous months, was sustained in December 2004. The appreciation which took place in 2004 will be conducive to inflation decrease in 2005. The data collected since the last MPC meeting confirm the November Inflation Report expectations, according to which the GDP growth rate in the upcoming two years will stand somewhat lower than 4.5-5.5%. It is expected that in 2005 the role of net exports as a factor contributing to economic growth will diminish and the role of investment as a growth factor will rise. Should the information on the low investment dynamics be confirmed, the probability of economic growth dynamics in 2005-2006 running lower than expected in the Report would increase. In the Council's opinion the balance of risks for future inflation has not changed significantly since the previous meeting. The probability of inflation staying above the target of 2.5% in 2006 is still higher than the probability of inflation falling below target. Thus the Council maintained its tightening monetary policy bias. The Council also adopted a resolution on the principles of conducting open market operations shortening the time frame of basic operations from 14 to 7 days. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 25-26 January 2005."
Thailand,2004-12-15,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 15 December 2004 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. In the first nine months of this year, the economy expanded at a satisfactory rate, averaging 64 per cent year-on-year, with main contributions coming from exports and domestic spending. Although the recent economic data in October showed moderate expansion in domestic spending, growth momentum remained strong in other sectors, especially exports. The MPC assessed that there was potential risk of a global economic slowdown, but declining world oil prices should help mitigate the overall risk compared to the last meeting. Regarding economic stability, headline inflation further accelerated in November, albeit at a slower rate of 30 per cent. The MPC assessed that lower oil prices and the appreciation of the Thai baht should help alleviate the inflationary pressure from that previously projected. External stability remained robust, with the current account expected to be in surplus this year and the next. Nevertheless short-term capital flows should be closely monitored to reduce baht volatility. Notwithstanding the declining short-term inflationary pressure from lower oil prices and the stronger baht, the situation could be temporary and should be monitored closely. To maintain economic stability in light of continued economic stability, the MPC deemed that interest rates should adjust towards appropriate levels to maintain economic stability going forward. The current low interest rate environment risked accelerating inflation and undermining sustainable growth. The MPC thus decided to raise the 14-day repurchase rate by 25 basis points, from 175 to 2 per cent per annum, effective from today."
Romania,2004-12-19,"In its meeting on 16 December 2004, the NBR Board made an overview of the recent developments in macroeconomic indicators, as well as the prospects for the period ahead. In November 2004, the 12-month inflation rate fell to 9.9. percent, with the inflation forecast suggesting further reduction in December. The NBR Board decided to lower the policy rate by 0.75 percentage points to 17 percent in order to confirm the continued disinflation. As aggregate demand is seen rising at a sustained rate and considering the relative price adjustments in the wake of corrections to administered prices in 2005 Q1, the NBR Board decided to maintain a cautious monetary policy stance so as to meet the inflation targets, including those on a longer time horizon."
Nigeria,2004-12-20,"PRESS RELEASE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA. COMMUNIQUE NO. 41 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. IN DECEMBER, 2004 The Monetary Policy Committee of the CBN held its 188th meeting on December 14, 2004 and agreed to sustain the existing monetary policy measures. Price developments since the last meeting of the MPC indicated that both the 12- month moving average and the year-on-year inflation rates moderated. The 12-month moving average inflation rate decelerated from 191 per cent in August 2004 to 182 per cent in September 2004. The year-on-year inflation rate decelerated significantly to 91 per cent in September 2004 from 130 per cent in the preceding month, reflecting the moderation in prices of all items less farm produce and energy. The exchange rate of the naira remained relatively stable in the Dutch Auction System of the foreign exchange market. Indeed the nominal exchange rate has appreciated in 2004 relative to 2003. The gross official reserves increased further to US $1613 billion in November 2004 from US $1467 billion and US $1327 billion at the end of October and September 2004 respectively. The stock of external reserves at the end of November 2004 surpassed the US$153 billion target for end-2004. Broad money stock (M ) increased by 131 per cent 2 during the first eleven months of 2004. This represented an annualised growth rate of 143 per cent, which was less than the 160 per cent target for 2004. In addition, credit (net) to government declined further in the first eleven months of 2004, while credit to the private sector rose by 259 per cent as compared with the 220 per cent target for 2004. The Committee remained positive about the outlook for the rest of the year. It expects the external reserves to rise further owing to a projected increase in demand for Nigeria's crude oil exports. The Committee also expects that with a continuation of current fiscal operations, the money supply would stay within its programmed target and that the inflation rate would also moderate further. Against this background the Committee decided not to take any new policy action. The Committee, however, agreed to monitor macroeconomic developments very closely, including the financing of the fiscal deficits. The Committee also noted that one of the challenges of monetary management in 2005 would be the financing of the deficits and the sharing of the excess crude oil revenue. In order to sustain the gains of 2004; the monetary authority might adopt a tighter policy stance in 2005, which might embrace the movement of public sector deposits in and out of banks. Special MPC will be held in January to consider the Monetary Policy Framework for 2005. James K Olekah Secretary. Monetary Policy Committee. Central Bank of Nigeria. Abuja."
Israel,2004-12-27,"27.12.04 The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for January 2005 The Bank of Israel today announced that in the context of its monetary program for January 2005, the interest rate will be reduced by 0.2 of a percentage point, to 3.7 percent. The decision to lower the interest rate is based on the Bank's assessment that the expected rate of inflation next year is within the range of the government's target of price stability, i.e., 1-3 percent a year. Developments in the foreign currency market, the Treasury bill market, and the government bond market also help to make it possible to continue preserving price stability at a lower interest rate: The foreign currency market is stable. The exchange rate continues to be relatively stable. Since the beginning of the year the NIS appreciated by about one percent against the dollar, and depreciated by about one percent againstthe currency basket. Bid-offer spreads remain low, and Israel's general country risk premium and the risk premium of the foreign currency market alsocontinue to be low. The Treasury bill market is calm, and has shown a persistent reduction in yields in the last few months. Thus, the yield on one-year Treasury bills which reached its 2004 peak in May, at 5.2 percent, is currently down to only 4.3 percent. In the government bond market, for both CPI-indexed and unindexed bonds, the decline in yields to all terms persists. For example, the yield on unindexed 10-year government (Shahar) bonds went down from 7.9 percent in May to 7.3 percent in December, and in the same period the real yield on indexed 10-year government (Galil) bonds declined from 4.4 percent to 4.1 percent. This decline is an indication of the public's confidence that the government will continue to observe fiscal discipline. In this context the great importance of the Knesset's approval of the 2005 budget along the lines confirmed by the government must be stressed yet again. Despite the above, the uncertainty deriving from the markets' potential reaction to the large deficits in the US budget and current account-that islikely to affect the future level of the interest rate and growth in the US, and hence also, directly and indirectly. Israel's economy-cannot be ignored. Nevertheless. Israel's economy is continuing along a path of growth, and additional jobs are being created, and there are signs of a slow downward trend in unemployment, with a rise in the rate of participation in the labor force. Investments still constitute the Achilles' heel of the growth process. In this context it would be appropriate to afford special attention to providing renewed impetus to infrastructure investment. In the last two years the Bank of Israel has changed the focus of its interest-rate policy so as to support economic growth. Within this framework the Bank reduced the interest rate from 9.1 percent in December 2002 to thecurrent rate of 3.7 percent. Concurrently, real interest came down from about 7 percent to its present level of 2-3 percent. This process also had a significant effect on the money supply: in the first half of 2003 the change in the money supply, with the high interest rate, was negative; as the interest rate was reduced, the money supply started expanding from the secondhalf of 2003, and in 2004 the rate of change increased till it reached 20 percent a year in the second half of the year. Against the background of fiscal discipline observed in the last two years, the process of lowering theshort-term interest rate by the Bank of Israel contributed to the reduction of medium-term and long-term yields, as well as to the rise in the stock market. These developments help to lower the cost of sources of finance, and thereby have positive implications for the recovery of real economic activity. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor closely: the effects on capital flows of the contraction of the differential between its interest rate and that of the US Federal Reserve and the contraction of the yield gaps between US and Israeli government bonds; the trends of capital flows to and from emerging markets; and changes in the risks attributed to Israel's economy by Israeli and foreign investors. These risks are still at a low level, enabling the continued contraction of the differentials between Israel's interest rate and those abroad, without disturbing the equilibrium of the foreign currency market. The risk premium, as measured by the 5-year credit-default-swap (CDS) market was about 41 basis points inDecember. The yield spread between 10-year Shahar bonds and 10-year US government bonds.</td> d The rate of interest in the US was changed on 14 December 2004. The Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve is due to convene on February 2 nd 2005 for its regular review of interest-rate policy. Table 3: Central-Bank Interest Rates in Several Countries.
