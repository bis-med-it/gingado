The reform markedly deregulated labour markets, with the purpose of increasing productivity and thereby unlocking growth. Some of its main points are:\n\nprominence of collective bargaining between firms and employees over statutory “blanket” provisions\nlower costs for employers of employment termination without just cause\ndiscouraging of labour litigation by employees, previously diagnosed as being excessive and contributing to clogging the judicial system\n\nThe reform was enacted in July 2017 and went into effect in November of the same year."

    "text": "Establishing a benchmark model\nGenerally speaking, it is a good idea to establish a benchmark model at the first stages of development of the machine learning model. gingado offers a class of automatic benchmarks that can be used off-the-shelf depending on the task at hand: RegressionBenchmark and ClassificationBenchmark. It is also good to keep in mind that more advanced users can create their own benchmark on top of a base class provided by gingado: ggdBenchmark.\nFor this application, since we are interested in running a regression task, we will use RegressionBenchmark:\n\n\nCode\nfrom gingado.benchmark import RegressionBenchmark\n\n\nWhat this object does is the following:\n\nit creates a random forest\nthree different versions of the random forest are trained on the user data\nthe version that performs better is chosen as the benchmark\nright after it is trained, the benchmark is documented using gingado’s ModelCard documenter.\n\nThe user can easily change the parameters above. For example, instead of a random forest the user might prefer a neural network as the benchmark. Or, in lieu of the default parameters provided by gingado, users might have their own idea of what could be a reasonable parameter space to search.\nRandom forests are chosen as the go-to benchmark algorithm because of their reasonably good performance in a wide variety of settings, the fact that they don’t require much data transformation (ie, normalising the data to have zero mean and one standard deviation), and by virtue of their relatively transparency about the importance of each regressor.\nThe first step is to initialise the benchmark object. At this time, we pass some arguments about how we want it to behave. In this case, we set the verbosity level to produce output related to each alternative considered. Then we fit it to the data.\n\n\nCode\n#####\n#####\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nrfr = RandomForestRegressor()\nrfr.fit(X, y)\n\n\nRandomForestRegressor()In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

They are scaled so that the sum for all features is one. Higher importance amounts indicate that that particular regressor is a more important contributor to the final prediction.\n\n\nCode\nregressor_importance = pd.DataFrame(\n    benchmark.benchmark.best_estimator_.feature_importances_, \n    index=X.columns, \n    columns=[\"Importance\"]\n    )\n\nregressor_importance.sort_values(by=\"Importance\", ascending=False) \\\n    .plot.bar(figsize=(20, 8), title='Regressor importance')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph above, we can see that the regressor bmp1l (black-market premium on foreign exchange) predominates.

    "text": "Testing the conditional converge hypothesis\nNow we can leverage our automatic benchmark model to test the conditional converge hypothesis - ie, the preposition that countries with lower starting GDP tend to grow faster than other comparable countries. In other words, this hypothesis predicts that when GDP growth is regressed on the level of past GDP and on an adequate set of covariates \\(X\\), the coefficient on past GDP levels are negative.\nSince we have the results for the importance of each regressor in separating countries by their growth result, we can compare the estimated coefficient for GDP levels in regressions that include different regressors in the vector \\(X\\). To maintain this example a simple exercise, the following three models are estimated:\n\n\\(X\\) contains the five most important regressors, as estimated by the benchmark model (see the graph above)\n\\(X\\) contains the five least important regressors, from the same estimation as above\n\\(X\\) is the empty set - in other words, this is a simple equation on GDP growth on GDP levels\n\nA result that would be consistent with the conditionality of the conditional convergence hypothesis is the first equation resulting in a negative coefficient for starting GDP, while the following two equations may not necessarily be successful in identifying a negative coefficient. This is because the least important regressors are not likely to have sufficient predictive power to separate countries into comparable groups.\nThe five more and less important regressors are:\n\n\nCode\ntop_five = regressor_importance.sort_values(by=\"Importance\", ascending=False).head(5)\nbottom_five = regressor_importance.sort_values(by=\"Importance\", ascending=True).head(5)\n\ntop_five, bottom_five\n\n\n(          Importance\n bmp1l       0.056722\n pop6565     0.045948\n teasec65    0.033482\n xr65        0.032641\n ex1         0.030498,\n           Importance\n s65         0.005387\n pf65        0.005492\n humanf65    0.006471\n syr65       0.007239\n secc65      0.007303)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngdp_level = 'gdpsh465'\n\n\n\n\nCode\nX_topfive = X[[gdp_level] + list(top_five.index)]\nX_topfive = sm.add_constant(X_topfive)\nX_topfive.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconst\ngdpsh465\nbmp1l\npop6565\nteasec65\nxr65\nex1\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.0\n6.591674\n0.2837\n0.027591\n17.3\n0.348\n0.0729\n\n\n1\n1.0\n6.829794\n0.6141\n0.035637\n18.0\n0.525\n0.0940\n\n\n2\n1.0\n8.895082\n0.0000\n0.076685\n20.7\n1.082\n0.1741\n\n\n3\n1.0\n7.565275\n0.1997\n0.031039\n22.7\n6.625\n0.1265\n\n\n4\n1.0\n7.162397\n0.1740\n0.026281\n17.6\n2.500\n0.1211\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nX_bottomfive = X[[gdp_level] + list(bottom_five.index)]\nX_bottomfive = sm.add_constant(X_bottomfive)\nX_bottomfive.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconst\ngdpsh465\ns65\npf65\nhumanf65\nsyr65\nsecc65\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.0\n6.591674\n0.04\n0.21\n0.043\n0.033\n0.13\n\n\n1\n1.0\n6.829794\n0.16\n0.65\n0.257\n0.173\n1.36\n\n\n2\n1.0\n8.895082\n0.56\n1.00\n8.384\n2.573\n15.68\n\n\n3\n1.0\n7.565275\n0.24\n1.00\n3.807\n0.438\n2.76\n\n\n4\n1.0\n7.162397\n0.17\n0.81\n1.720\n0.257\n2.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nX_onlyGDPlevel = sm.add_constant(X[gdp_level])\nX_onlyGDPlevel.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconst\ngdpsh465\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.0\n6.591674\n\n\n1\n1.0\n6.829794\n\n\n2\n1.0\n8.895082\n\n\n3\n1.0\n7.565275\n\n\n4\n1.0\n7.162397\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodels = dict(\n    topfive = sm.OLS(y, X_topfive).fit(),\n    bottomfive = sm.OLS(y, X_bottomfive).fit(),\n    onlyGDPlevel = sm.OLS(y, X_onlyGDPlevel).fit()\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncoefs = pd.DataFrame({name: model.conf_int().loc[gdp_level] for name, model in models.items()})\ncoefs.loc[0.5] = [model.params[gdp_level] for _, model in models.items()]\ncoefs = coefs.sort_index().reset_index(drop=True)\ncoefs.index = ['[0.025', 'coef on GDP levels', '0.975]']\ncoefs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntopfive\nbottomfive\nonlyGDPlevel\n\n\n\n\n[0.025\n-0.038529\n-0.039050\n-0.010810\n\n\ncoef on GDP levels\n-0.020704\n-0.014362\n0.001317\n\n\n0.975]\n-0.002878\n0.010326\n0.013444\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe equation using the top five regressors in explanatory power yielded a coefficient that is statistically speaking negative under the usual confidence interval levels. In contrast, the regression using the bottom five regressors failed to maintain that level of statistical significance (although the coefficient point estimate was still negative). And finally the regression on GDP level solely resulted, as in the past literature, on a point estimate that is also statistically not different than zero.\nThese results above offer a different way to add evidence to the conditional convergence hypothesis. In particular, with the help of gingado’s RegressionBenchmark model, it is possible to identify which covariates can meaningfully serve as covariates in a growth equation from those that cannot. This is important because if the covariate selection for some reason included only variables with little explanatory power instead of the most relevant ones, an economist might erroneously reach a different conclusion."

Actually, this is the purpose of gingado’s automatic documentation: to afford users more time so they can invest, if they want, on model documentation.\n\n\nCode\nbenchmark.model_documentation.open_questions()\n\n\n['model_details__developer',\n 'model_details__version',\n 'model_details__type',\n 'model_details__paper',\n 'model_details__citation',\n 'model_details__license',\n 'model_details__contact',\n 'intended_use__primary_uses',\n 'intended_use__primary_users',\n 'intended_use__out_of_scope',\n 'factors__relevant',\n 'factors__evaluation',\n 'metrics__performance_measures',\n 'metrics__thresholds',\n 'metrics__variation_approaches',\n 'evaluation_data__datasets',\n 'evaluation_data__motivation',\n 'evaluation_data__preprocessing',\n 'training_data__training_data',\n 'quant_analyses__unitary',\n 'quant_analyses__intersectional',\n 'ethical_considerations__sensitive_data',\n 'ethical_considerations__human_life',\n 'ethical_considerations__mitigations',\n 'ethical_considerations__risks_and_harms',\n 'ethical_considerations__use_cases',\n 'ethical_considerations__additional_information',\n 'caveats_recommendations__caveats',\n 'caveats_recommendations__recommendations']\n\n\nLet’s fill some information:\n\n\nCode\nbenchmark.model_documentation.fill_info({\n    'intended_use': {\n        'primary_uses': 'This model is trained for pedagogical uses only.',\n        'primary_users': 'Everyone is welcome to follow the description showing the development of this benchmark.'\n    }\n})\n\n\nNote the format, based on a Python dictionary. In particular, the open_questions method results include keys divided by double underscores.

    "text": "Clustering\nThe clustering algorithms used below are not themselves adapted from the general use methods. Rather, the functions offer convenience functionalities to find and retain the other variables in the same cluster.\nThese variables are usually entities (individuals, countries, stocks, etc) in a larger population.\nThe gingado clustering routines are designed to allow users standalone usage, or a seamless integration as part of a pipeline.\nThere are three levels of sophistication that users can choose from:\n\nusing the off-the-shelf clustering routines provided by gingado, which were selected to be applied cross various use cases;\nselecting an existing clustering routine from the scikit-learn.cluster module; or\ndesigning their own clustering algorithm.\n\n\nFindCluster\n\nFindCluster (cluster_alg: '[BaseEstimator, ClusterMixin]' = AffinityPropagation(), auto_document: 'ggdModelDocumentation' = &lt;class 'gingado.model_documentation.ModelCard'&gt;, random_state: 'int | None' = None)\n\nRetain only the columns of `X` that are in the same cluster as `y`.\n\nArgs:\n    cluster_alg (BaseEstimator|ClusterMixin): An instance of the clustering algorithm to use.\n    auto_document (ggdModelDocumentation): gingado Documenter template to facilitate model documentation.\n    random_state (int|None): The random seed to be used by the algorithm, if relevant. Defaults to None.\n\nfit\n\nfit (self, X, y)\n\nFit `FindCluster`.\n\nArgs:\n    X: The population of entities, organized in columns.\n    y: The entity of interest.\n\n\ntransform\n\ntransform (self, X) -&gt; 'np.array'\n\nKeep only the entities in `X` that belong to the same cluster as `y`.\n\nArgs:\n    X: The population of entities, organized in columns.\n\nReturns:\n    np.array: Columns of `X` that are in the same cluster as `y`.\n\n\nfit_transform\n\nfit_transform (self, X, y) -&gt; 'np.array'\n\nFit a `FindCluster` object and keep only the entities in `X` that belong to the same cluster as `y`.\n\nArgs:\n    X: The population of entities, organized in columns.\n    y: The entity of interest.\n\nReturns:\n    np.array: Columns of `X` that are in the same cluster as `y`.\n\n\ndocument\n\ndocument (self, documenter: 'ggdModelDocumentation | None' = None)\n\nDocument the `FindCluster` model using the template in `documenter`.\n\nArgs:\n    documenter (ggdModelDocumentation|None): A gingado Documenter or the documenter set in `auto_document` if None.\n        Defaults to None.\n\n\nExample: finding similar countries\nThe Barro and Lee (1994) dataset is used to illustrate the use of FindCluster. It is a country-level dataset. Let’s use it to answer the following question: for some specific country, what other countries are the closest to it considering the data available?\nFirst, we import the data:\n\nfrom gingado.datasets import load_BarroLee_1994\n\nThe data is organized by rows: each row is a different country, and the variables are organised in columns.\nThe dataset is originally organised for a regression of GDP growth (here denoted y) on the covariates (X). This is not what we want to do in this case. So instead of keeping GDP as a separate variable, the next step is to include it in the X DataFrame.\n\nX, y = load_BarroLee_1994()\nX['gdp'] = y\nX.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed: 0\ngdpsh465\nbmp1l\nfreeop\nfreetar\nh65\nhm65\nhf65\np65\npm65\n...\nsyr65\nsyrm65\nsyrf65\nteapri65\nteasec65\nex1\nim1\nxr65\ntot1\ngdp\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n6.591674\n0.2837\n0.153491\n0.043888\n0.007\n0.013\n0.001\n0.29\n0.37\n...\n0.033\n0.057\n0.010\n47.6\n17.3\n0.0729\n0.0667\n0.348\n-0.014727\n-0.024336\n\n\n1\n1\n6.829794\n0.6141\n0.313509\n0.061827\n0.019\n0.032\n0.007\n0.91\n1.00\n...\n0.173\n0.274\n0.067\n57.1\n18.0\n0.0940\n0.1438\n0.525\n0.005750\n0.100473\n\n\n2\n2\n8.895082\n0.0000\n0.204244\n0.009186\n0.260\n0.325\n0.201\n1.00\n1.00\n...\n2.573\n2.478\n2.667\n26.5\n20.7\n0.1741\n0.1750\n1.082\n-0.010040\n0.067051\n\n\n3\n3\n7.565275\n0.1997\n0.248714\n0.036270\n0.061\n0.070\n0.051\n1.00\n1.00\n...\n0.438\n0.453\n0.424\n27.8\n22.7\n0.1265\n0.1496\n6.625\n-0.002195\n0.064089\n\n\n4\n4\n7.162397\n0.1740\n0.299252\n0.037367\n0.017\n0.027\n0.007\n0.82\n0.85\n...\n0.257\n0.287\n0.229\n34.5\n17.6\n0.1211\n0.1308\n2.500\n0.003283\n0.027930\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 63 columns\n\n\n\nNow we remove the first column (an identifier) and transpose the DataFrame, so that countries are organized in columns.\nEach country is identified by a number: 0, 1, …\n\nX = X.iloc[:, 1:]\ncountries = X.T\ncountries.columns = ['country_' + str(c) for c in countries.columns]\ncountries.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncountry_0\ncountry_1\ncountry_2\ncountry_3\ncountry_4\ncountry_5\ncountry_6\ncountry_7\ncountry_8\ncountry_9\n...\ncountry_80\ncountry_81\ncountry_82\ncountry_83\ncountry_84\ncountry_85\ncountry_86\ncountry_87\ncountry_88\ncountry_89\n\n\n\n\ngdpsh465\n6.591674\n6.829794\n8.895082\n7.565275\n7.162397\n7.218910\n7.853605\n7.703910\n9.063463\n8.151910\n...\n9.030974\n8.995537\n8.234830\n8.332549\n8.645586\n8.991064\n8.025189\n9.030137\n8.865312\n8.912339\n\n\nbmp1l\n0.283700\n0.614100\n0.000000\n0.199700\n0.174000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.277600\n0.000000\n0.148400\n...\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.036300\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.005000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\nfreeop\n0.153491\n0.313509\n0.204244\n0.248714\n0.299252\n0.258865\n0.182525\n0.215275\n0.109614\n0.110885\n...\n0.293138\n0.304720\n0.288405\n0.345485\n0.288440\n0.371898\n0.296437\n0.265778\n0.282939\n0.150366\n\n\nfreetar\n0.043888\n0.061827\n0.009186\n0.036270\n0.037367\n0.020880\n0.014385\n0.029713\n0.002171\n0.028579\n...\n0.005517\n0.011658\n0.011589\n0.006503\n0.005995\n0.014586\n0.013615\n0.008629\n0.005048\n0.024377\n\n\nh65\n0.007000\n0.019000\n0.260000\n0.061000\n0.017000\n0.023000\n0.039000\n0.024000\n0.402000\n0.145000\n...\n0.245000\n0.246000\n0.183000\n0.188000\n0.256000\n0.255000\n0.108000\n0.288000\n0.188000\n0.257000\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 90 columns\n\n\n\nSuppose we are interested in country No 13.

Collect this data in a vector \\(\\mathbb{Y}_{-1, t}^{N}\\). Then, following Doudchenko and Imbens (2016):\n\\[\n\\hat{Y}_{i, t}^{N} = f^*(\\mathbb{Y}_{-1, t}^{N}),\n\\]\nwith the star (\\(*\\)) superscript on the function \\(f(\\cdot)\\) representing that it was trained only with data up until the intervention date. The exact form of \\(f(\\cdot)\\) depends on the argument estimator. A general use estimator is the random forest (Breiman 2001).\nThe panel data itself might be the whole population in the data, or a subset when using the whole population might be too cumbersome to run analyses (eg, if the data contains too many entities). One way to select this subsample of control units without including subjective judgment in the data is quantitatilve. The control units are selected through a clustering algorithm (argument cluster_arg). One cluster algorithm that can be used is affinity propagation (Frey and Dueck 2007).\nTo finalise, the quality of the synthetic control can be assessed in many ways. One fully data-driven way to achieve this is by using manifold learning: lower-dimensional embeddings of a higher-dimensional data. A preferred manifold learning algorithm is t-SNE (Van der Maaten and Hinton 2008).\nThe relative distance between embeddings and the target centre, as well as the control and the target, represent the chance that a better feasible control (either from real or combined) will materialise. The intuition behind this test is:\n\nlet \\(d_{i,j}\\) be the Euclidean distance between the embeddings (2d points) of entities \\(i\\) and \\(j\\)\nif only a very small percentage of \\(d_{1, j \\in (2, ..., N)}\\) are lower than \\(d_{1, \\text{Synthetic control}}\\), than the synthetic control produced with \\(f(\\cdot)\\) is indeed a formula that provides one of the best alternative.\n\nMain references:\n\nAbadie and Gardeazabal (2003)\nAbadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010)\nAbadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2015)\nDoudchenko and Imbens (2016)\nAbadie (2021)\n\n\n\nExample: impact of labour reform on productivity\nSee Machine controls: Synthetic controls with machine learning."

Male attainment plays a positive role in primary-school enrollment ratios, and male and female attainment relate positively to enrollment at the secondary level.}\n}\n\nX, y = load_BarroLee_1994()\nX.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed: 0\ngdpsh465\nbmp1l\nfreeop\nfreetar\nh65\nhm65\nhf65\np65\npm65\n...\nseccf65\nsyr65\nsyrm65\nsyrf65\nteapri65\nteasec65\nex1\nim1\nxr65\ntot1\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n6.591674\n0.2837\n0.153491\n0.043888\n0.007\n0.013\n0.001\n0.29\n0.37\n...\n0.04\n0.033\n0.057\n0.010\n47.6\n17.3\n0.0729\n0.0667\n0.348\n-0.014727\n\n\n1\n1\n6.829794\n0.6141\n0.313509\n0.061827\n0.019\n0.032\n0.007\n0.91\n1.00\n...\n0.64\n0.173\n0.274\n0.067\n57.1\n18.0\n0.0940\n0.1438\n0.525\n0.005750\n\n\n2\n2\n8.895082\n0.0000\n0.204244\n0.009186\n0.260\n0.325\n0.201\n1.00\n1.00\n...\n18.14\n2.573\n2.478\n2.667\n26.5\n20.7\n0.1741\n0.1750\n1.082\n-0.010040\n\n\n3\n3\n7.565275\n0.1997\n0.248714\n0.036270\n0.061\n0.070\n0.051\n1.00\n1.00\n...\n2.63\n0.438\n0.453\n0.424\n27.8\n22.7\n0.1265\n0.1496\n6.625\n-0.002195\n\n\n4\n4\n7.162397\n0.1740\n0.299252\n0.037367\n0.017\n0.027\n0.007\n0.82\n0.85\n...\n2.11\n0.257\n0.287\n0.229\n34.5\n17.6\n0.1211\n0.1308\n2.500\n0.003283\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 62 columns\n\n\n\n\ny.plot.hist(title='GDP growth', bins=30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nload_CB_speeches (year: 'str | int | list' = 'all', cache: 'bool' = True, timeout: 'float | None' = 120, **kwargs) -&gt; 'pd.DataFrame'\n\nLoad Central Bankers speeches dataset from\nBank for International Settlements (2024).

This corresponds to the value of the outcome for any untreated observations. The function should always take at least two arguments: X and bias, even if one of them is unused; bias is the constant. The argument is zero by default but can be set by the user to be another value.\n\ncausal_sim = make_causal_effect(\n    bias=0.123,\n    pretreatment_outcome=lambda X, bias: bias,\n    return_assignment=True,\n    return_as_dict=True\n)\n\nassert all(causal_sim['y'][causal_sim['treatment_assignment'] == 0] == 0.123)\n\nIf the outcome depends on specific columns of \\(X\\), this can be implemented as shown below.\n\ncausal_sim = make_causal_effect(\n    pretreatment_outcome=lambda X, bias: X[:, 1] + np.maximum(X[:,2], 0) + X[:,3] * X[:,4] + bias\n)\n\nAnd of course, the outcome might also have a random component.\nIn these cases (and in other parts of this function), when the user wants to use the same random number generator as the other parts of the function, the function must have an argment rng for the NumPy random number generator used in other parts of the function.\n\ncausal_sim_1 = make_causal_effect(\n    pretreatment_outcome=lambda X, bias, rng: X[:, 1] + np.maximum(X[:,2], 0) + X[:,3] * X[:,4] + bias + rng.standard_normal(size=X.shape[0]),\n    random_state=42,\n    return_pretreatment_y=True,\n    return_as_dict=True\n)\n\ncausal_sim_2 = make_causal_effect(\n    pretreatment_outcome=lambda X, bias, rng: X[:, 1] + np.maximum(X[:,2], 0) + X[:,3] * X[:,4] + bias + rng.standard_normal(size=X.shape[0]),\n    random_state=42,\n    return_pretreatment_y=True,\n    return_as_dict=True\n)\n\nassert all(causal_sim_1['X'].reshape(-1, 1) == causal_sim_2['X'].reshape(-1, 1))\nassert all(causal_sim_1['y'] == causal_sim_2['y'])\nassert all(causal_sim_1['pretreatment_y'] == causal_sim_2['pretreatment_y'])\n\n\n\nTreatment propensity\nThe treatment propensity of observations may all be the same, in which case treatment_propensity is a floating number between 0 and 1.\n\nsame_propensity_sim = make_causal_effect(\n    n_samples=485,\n    treatment_propensity=0.3,\n    return_propensity=True,\n    return_as_dict=True\n)\n\nassert np.unique(same_propensity_sim['propensity']) == 0.3\nassert len(same_propensity_sim['propensity']) == 485\n\nOr it might depend on the observation’s covariates, with the user passing a function with an argument ‘X’.\n\nheterogenous_propensities_sim = make_causal_effect(\n    n_samples=1000,\n    treatment_propensity=lambda X: 0.3 + (X[:, 0] &gt; 0) * 0.2,\n    return_propensity=True,\n    return_as_dict=True\n)\n\nplt.title(\"Heterogenously distributed propensities\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Propensity\")\nplt.ylabel(\"No of observations\")\nplt.hist(heterogenous_propensities_sim['propensity'], bins=100)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe propensity can also be randomly allocated, together with covariate dependence or not. Note that even if the propensity is completely random and does not depend on covariates, the function must still use the argument X to calculate a random vector with the appropriate size.\n\nrandom_propensities_sim = make_causal_effect(\n    n_samples=50000,\n    treatment_propensity=lambda X: np.random.uniform(size=X.shape[0]),\n    return_propensity=True,\n    return_as_dict=True\n)\n\nplt.title(\"Randomly distributed propensities\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Propensity\")\nplt.ylabel(\"No of observations\")\nplt.hist(random_propensities_sim['propensity'], bins=100)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment assignment\nAs seen above, every observation has a given treatment propensity - the chance that they are treated. Users can define how this propensity translates into actual treatment with the argument treatment_assignment. This argument takes a function, which must have an argument called propensity.\nThe default value for this argument is a function returning 1s with probability propensity and 0s otherwise. Any other function should always return either 0s or 1s for the data simulator to work as expected.\n\ncausal_sim = make_causal_effect(\n    treatment_assignment=lambda propensity: np.random.binomial(1, propensity)\n)\n\nWhile the case above is likely to be the most useful in practice, this argument accepts more complex relationships between an observation’s propensity and the actual treatment assignment.\nFor example, if treatment is subject to rationing, then one could simulate data with 10 observations where only the samples with the highest (say, 3) propensity scores get treated, as below:\n\nrationed_treatment_sim = make_causal_effect(\n    n_samples=10,\n    treatment_propensity=lambda X: np.random.uniform(size=X.shape[0]),\n    treatment_assignment=lambda propensity: propensity &gt;= propensity[np.argsort(propensity)][-3],\n    return_propensity=True,\n    return_assignment=True,\n    return_as_dict=True\n)\n\n\nrationed_treatment = pd.DataFrame(\n    np.column_stack((rationed_treatment_sim['propensity'], rationed_treatment_sim['treatment_assignment'])),\n    columns = ['propensity', 'assignment']\n    )\n\n\nrationed_treatment.sort_values('propensity')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npropensity\nassignment\n\n\n\n\n4\n0.079694\n0.0\n\n\n3\n0.131207\n0.0\n\n\n5\n0.259205\n0.0\n\n\n8\n0.340038\n0.0\n\n\n0\n0.363617\n0.0\n\n\n9\n0.404218\n0.0\n\n\n7\n0.654724\n0.0\n\n\n6\n0.751756\n1.0\n\n\n2\n0.794800\n1.0\n\n\n1\n0.927379\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment value\nThe treatment argument indicates the magnitude of the treatment for each observation assigned for treatment. Its value is always a function that must have an argument called assignment, as in the first example below.\nIn the simplest case, the treatment is a binary variable indicating whether or not a variable was treated. In other words, the treatment is the same as the assignment, as in the default value.\nBut users can also simulate data with heterogenous treatment, conditional on assignment. This is done by including a pararemeter X in the function, as shown in the second example below.\n\nbinary_treatment_sim = make_causal_effect(\n    n_samples=15,\n    treatment=lambda assignment: assignment,\n    return_assignment=True,\n    return_treatment_value=True,\n    return_as_dict=True\n)\n\nassert sum(binary_treatment_sim['treatment_assignment'] - binary_treatment_sim['treatment_value'][0]) == 0\n\nHeterogenous treatments may occur in settings where treatment intensity, conditional on assignment, varies across observations. Please note the following:\n\nthe heterogenous treatment amount may or may not depend on covariates, but either way, if treatment values are heterogenous, then X needs to be an argument of the function passed to treatment, if nothing else to make sure the shapes match; and\nif treatments are heterogenous, then it is important to multiply the treatment value with the assignment argument to ensure that observations that are not assigned to be treated are indeed not treated (the function will return an AssertionError otherwise).\n\n\nhetereogenous_treatment_sim = make_causal_effect(\n    n_samples=15,\n    treatment=lambda assignment, X: assignment * np.random.uniform(size=X.shape[0]),\n    return_assignment=True,\n    return_treatment_value=True,\n    return_as_dict=True\n)\n\nIn contrast to the function above, in the chunk below the function make_causal_effect fails because a treatment value is also assigned to observations that were not assigned for treatment.\n\ntry:\n    make_causal_effect(\n        treatment=lambda assignment, X: assignment + np.random.uniform(size=X.shape[0])\n    )\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n\nArgument `treatment` must be a function that returns 0 for observations with `assignment` == 0.\nOne suggestion is to multiply the desired treatment value with `assignment`.\n\n\n\n\nTreatment effect\nThe treatment effect can be homogenous, ie, is doesn’t depend on any other characteristic of the individual observations (in other words, does not depend on \\(X_i\\)), or heterogenous (where the treatment effect on \\(Y_i\\) does depend on each observation’s \\(X_i\\)). This can be done by specifying the causal relationship through a lambda function, as below:\n\nhomogenous_effects_sim = make_causal_effect(\n        treatment_effect=lambda treatment_value: treatment_value,\n        return_treatment_value=True,\n        return_as_dict=True\n)\n\nassert (homogenous_effects_sim['treatment_effect'] == homogenous_effects_sim['treatment_value']).all()\n\nheterogenous_effects_sim = make_causal_effect(\n        treatment_effect=lambda treatment_value, X: np.maximum(X[:, 1], 0) * treatment_value,\n        return_treatment_value=True,\n        return_as_dict=True\n)\n\nassert (heterogenous_effects_sim['treatment_effect'] != heterogenous_effects_sim['treatment_value']).any()"

Benchmarks is a convenience wrapper for reading the training data, passing it through a simplified pipeline consisting of data imputation and a standard scalar, and then the benchmark function calibrated with a grid search.\nA gingado Benchmark object seeks to automatise a significant part of creating a benchmark model. Importantly, the Benchmark object also has a compare method that helps users evaluate if candidate models are better than the benchmark, and if one of them is, it becomes the new benchmark. This compare method takes as argument another fitted estimator (which could be itself a solo estimator or a whole pipeline) or a list of fitted estimators.\nBenchmarks start with default values that should perform reasonably well in most settings, but the user is also free to choose any of the benchmark’s components by passing as arguments the data split, pipeline, and/or a dictionary of parameters for the hyperparameter tuning."

    "text": "Data split\ngingado benchmarks rely on hyperparameter tuning to discover the benchmark specification that is most likely to perform better with the user data. This tuning in turn depends on a data splitting strategy for the cross-validation. By default, gingado uses StratifiedShuffleSplit (in classification problems) or ShuffleSplit (in regression problems) if the data is not time series and TimeSeriesSplit otherwise.\nThe user may overrun these defaults either by directly setting the parameter cv or default_cv when instanciating the gingado benchmark class. The difference is that default_cv is only used after gingado checks that the data is not a time series (if a time dimension exists, then TimeSeriesSplit is used).\n\nX, y = make_classification()\nbm_cls = ClassificationBenchmark(cv=TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=3)).fit(X, y)\nassert bm_cls.benchmark.n_splits_ == 3\n\nX, y = make_regression()\nbm_reg = RegressionBenchmark(default_cv=ShuffleSplit(n_splits=7)).fit(X, y)\nassert bm_reg.benchmark.n_splits_ == 7\n\nPlease refer to this page for more information on the different Splitter classes available on scikit-learn, and this page for practical advice on how to choose a splitter for data that are not time series. Any one of these objects (or a custom splitter that is compatible with them) can be passed to a Benchmark object.\nUsers that wish to use specific parameters should include the actual Splitter object as the parameter, as done with the n_splits parameter in the chunk above."

Both classes derive from a base class ggdBenchmark, which implements methods that facilitate model comparison. Users that want to create a customised benchmark model for themselves have two options:\n\nthe simpler possibility is to train the estimator as usual, and then assign the fitted estimator to a Benchmark object.\nif the user wants more control over the fitting process of estimating the benchmark, they can create a class that subclasses from ggdBenchmark and either implements custom fit, predict and score methods, or also subclasses from scikit-learn’s BaseEstimator.\n\nIn any case, if the user wants the benchmark to automatically detect if the data is a time series and also to document the model right after fitting, the fit method should call self._fit on the data. Otherwise, the user can simply implement any consistent logic in fit as the user sees fit (pun intended)."

A base class facilitates the creation of generic ways to document models, and gingado includes two specific model documentation templates off-the-shelf as described below.\nThe model documentation is performed by Documenters, objects that subclass from the base class ggdModelDocumentation. This base class offers code that can be used by any Documenter to read the model in question, format the information according to a template and save the resulting documentation in a JSON format. Documenters save the underlying information using the JSON format. With the JSON documentation file at hand, the user can then deploy existing third-party libraries to transform the information stored in JSON into a variety of formats (eg, HTML, PDF) as needed.\nOne current area of development is the automatic filing of some fields related to the model. The objective is to automatise documentation of the information that can be fetched automatically from the model, leaving time for the analyst to concentrate on other tasks, such as considering the ethical implications of the machine learning model being trained."

    "text": "Temporal features\nTemporal features, such as the day of the week, month, or hour, provide valuable information for time series data, helping to capture seasonality, trends, and cyclic patterns. These features are especially useful because they represent known future information that can enhance model predictions. The gingado library offers the get_timefeat method to extract these features from a time series:\n\nget_timefeat\n\nget_timefeat (df: pandas.core.frame.DataFrame | pandas.core.series.Series, freq: str | gingado.internals.Frequency, columns: list[str] | None = None, add_to_df: bool = True) -&gt; pandas.core.frame.DataFrame\n\nGenerate temporal features from a DataFrame with a DatetimeIndex.\n\nThis function creates various time-based features such as day of week,\nday of month, week of year, etc., based on the DatetimeIndex of the input DataFrame.\n\nArgs:\n    df (pd.DataFrame | pd.Series): Input DataFrame or Series with a DatetimeIndex.\n    freq (FrequencyLike): Frequency of the input DataFrame. Can either be a string which is\n        a supported pandas frequency alias or an gingado-interal Frequency object.\n    columns (list[str], optional): List of colums with temporal feature names that should be\n        kept.

This is a good opportunity to showcase how we can use gingado’s in-built base class ggdBenchmark to build our customised benchmark model, in this case a random walk.\nThe calculation of the random walk benchmark is very simple. Still, creating a gingado benchmark offers some advantages: it is easier to compare alternative models, and the model documentation is done more seamlessly.\nA custom benchmark model must implement the following steps:\n\nsub-class ggdBenchmark (or alternatively implement its methods)\ndefine an estimator that is compatible with scikit-learn’s API:\n\nat the very least, it has a fit method that returns self\n\n\nIf the user is relying on a custom estimator - like in this case, a random walk estimator to align with the literature - then this custom estimator also has some requirements:\n\nit should ideally subclass scikit-learn’s BaseEstimator (mostly for the get_params / set_params methods)\nthree methods are necessary:\n\nfit, which should at least create an attribute ending in an underline (“_“), so that gingado knows it is fitted\npredict\nscore\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nfrom gingado.benchmark import ggdBenchmark\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import VotingRegressor\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclass RandomWalkEstimator(BaseEstimator):\n    def __init__(self, scoring='neg_root_mean_squared_error'):\n        self.scoring = scoring\n    \n    def fit(self, X, y=None):\n        self.n_samples_ = X.shape[0]\n        return self\n\n    def predict(self, X):\n        return np.zeros(X.shape[0])\n\n    def score(self, X, y, sample_weight=None):\n        from sklearn.metrics import root_mean_squared_error\n        y_pred = self.predict(X)\n        return root_mean_squared_error(y, y_pred, sample_weight=sample_weight)\n\n    def forecast(self, forecast_horizon=1):\n        self.forecast_horizon = forecast_horizon\n        return np.zeros(self.forecast_horizon)\n\nclass RandomWalkBenchmark(ggdBenchmark):\n    def __init__(\n        self, \n        estimator=RandomWalkEstimator(), \n        auto_document=ModelCard,\n        cv=TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=10, test_size=60), \n        ensemble_method=VotingRegressor, \n        verbose_grid=None):\n        self.estimator=estimator\n        self.auto_document=auto_document\n        self.cv=cv\n        self.ensemble_method=ensemble_method\n        self.verbose_grid=verbose_grid\n\n    def fit(self, X, y=None):\n        self.benchmark=self.estimator\n        self.benchmark.fit(X, y)\n        return self\n\n\n\n\nTraining the candidate models\nNow that we have a benchmark, we can create candidate models that will try to beat it.\nIn this simplified example, we will choose only two: a random forest, an AdaBoost regressor and a Lasso model. Their hyperparameters are not particularly important for the example, but of course they could be fine-tuned as well.\nIn the language of Rossi (2013), the models below are one “single-equation, lagged fundamental model” for each currency.\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostRegressor\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Lasso\n\n\n\n\nCode\nforest = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=250, max_features='log2').fit(X_train, y_train['USDBRL'])\nadaboost = AdaBoostRegressor(n_estimators=150).fit(X_train, y_train['USDBRL'])\nlasso = Lasso(alpha=0.1).fit(X_train, y_train['USDBRL'])\n\nrw = RandomWalkBenchmark().fit(X_train, y_train['USDBRL'])\n\n\nWe can now compare the model results, using the test dataset we held out previously.\nNote that we must pass the criterion against which we are comparing the forecasts.\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\n\n\n\n\nCode\nresults = rw.compare_fitted_candidates(\n    X_test, y_test['USDBRL'],\n    candidates=[forest, adaboost, lasso],\n    scoring_func=mean_squared_error)\n\npd.Series(results)\n\n\nRandomWalkEstimator()                                           0.000101\nRandomForestRegressor(max_features='log2', n_estimators=250)    0.000106\nAdaBoostRegressor(n_estimators=150)                             0.000106\nLasso(alpha=0.1)                                                0.000101\ndtype: float64\n\n\nAs mentioned above, benchmarks can facilitate the model documentation. In addition to the broader documentation that is already ongoing, each benchmark object create their own where they store model information. We can use that for the broader documentation.\nIn our case, the only parameter we created above during fit is the number of samples: not a particularly informative variable but it was included just for illustration purposes. In any case, the parameter appears in the “model_details” section, item “info”, of the benchmark’s rw documentation. Similarly, the parameters of more fully-fledged estimators also appear in that section.\n\n\nCode\nrw.document()\n\nrw.model_documentation.show_json()['model_details']['info']\n\n\n{'n_samples_': 4314}\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel_doc.fill_info({\n    'model_details': {'info': rw.model_documentation.show_json()['model_details']['info']}\n})\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel_doc.show_json()\n\n\n{'model_details': {'developer': 'Person or organisation developing the model',\n  'datetime': '2025-03-10 15:39:55 ',\n  'version': 'Model version',\n  'type': 'Model type',\n  'info': {'n_samples_': 4314},\n  'paper': 'Paper or other resource for more information',\n  'citation': 'Citation details',\n  'license': 'License',\n  'contact': 'Where to send questions or comments about the model'},\n 'intended_use': {'primary_uses': 'These models are simplified toy models made to illustrate the use of gingado',\n  'primary_users': 'Primary intended users',\n  'out_of_scope': 'These models were not constructed for decision-making and as such their use as predictors in real life decisions is strongly discouraged and out of scope.'},\n 'factors': {'relevant': 'Relevant factors',\n  'evaluation': 'Evaluation factors'},\n 'metrics': {'performance_measures': 'Consistent with most papers reviewed by Rossi (2013), these models were evaluated by their root mean squared error.',\n  'thresholds': 'Decision thresholds',\n  'variation_approaches': 'Variation approaches'},\n 'evaluation_data': {'datasets': 'Datasets',\n  'motivation': 'Motivation',\n  'preprocessing': 'Preprocessing'},\n 'training_data': {'training_data': '\\n        The training data comprise time series obtained from official sources (BIS and ECB) on:\\n        * foreign exchange rates\\n        * central bank policy rates\\n        * an estimated indicator for systemic stress\\n        The training and evaluation datasets are the same time series, only different windows in time.'},\n 'quant_analyses': {'unitary': 'Unitary results',\n  'intersectional': 'Intersectional results'},\n 'ethical_considerations': {'sensitive_data': 'These models were not trained with sensitive data.',\n  'human_life': 'The models do not involve the collection or use of individual-level data, and have no foreseen impact on human life.',\n  'mitigations': 'What risk mitigation strategies were used during model development?',\n  'risks_and_harms': 'What risks may be present in model usage?

    "text": "Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to gingado! Whether it’s reporting issues, suggesting new features, or contributing to the code, documentation, or tests, your involvement is highly appreciated.\n\n\n\n\nTo get started with contributing to gingado, you need to set up your development environment. This includes installing necessary tools and configuring your system to work efficiently with our codebase.\nTo install the dependencies to work with gingado, you need to install the execution dependencies and the development dependencies of gingado:\npip install -r requirements.txt\npip install -r dev_requirements.txt\nTo work with the documentation an tests, we use quarto. You can either use RStudio or Visual Studio Code with the Quarto extension installed for editing .qmd files which are used for generating documentation. Here’s how you can set up your environment:\n\nInstall Quarto: If you haven’t already, install Quarto from Quarto’s official website. Follow the instructions for your operating system.\nConfigure Your Editor:\n\nFor RStudio: Quarto is integrated with RStudio. Ensure you have the latest version of RStudio to work with Quarto seamlessly.\nFor Visual Studio Code: Install the Quarto extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace. This extension provides support for .qmd files, including syntax highlighting and preview capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo modify the index page or the README.md file in the repository root, please only edit the index.qmd file. All changes in the index.qmd file will be rendered to the README.md file and moved automatically to the repository root via a post-render script move_readme_to_root.py.\n\n\n\nIf you encounter a bug, have suggestions, or want to propose new functionalities:\n\nCheck Existing Issues: Ensure the bug or suggestion hasn’t been reported/mentioned before by searching under Issues on GitHub.\nCreate a New Issue: If no existing issue addresses the problem or suggestion, please create a new issue, providing a descriptive title, a clear description, and as much relevant information as possible. For bugs, include a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring, along with complete error messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo contribute changes to the codebase, including documentation and tests, follow these guidelines:\n\nDocument New Features: Clearly document new functions or classes in the .qmd files. Write clear descriptions, specify expected inputs and outputs, and include any relevant information to understand the functionality.\nInclude Tests: Implement tests for new functionalities as part of the .qmd files to ensure the integrity and reliability of the code. Make sure your tests cover the expected behavior and edge cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nFocused PRs: Each PR should be focused on a single topic. Avoid combining unrelated changes.\nSeparate Style and Functional Changes: Do not mix style changes with functional changes in the same PR.\nPreserve File Style: Avoid adding or removing vertical whitespace unnecessarily. Keep the original style of the files you edit.\nDevelopment Process: Do not use a submitted PR as a development playground. If additional work is needed, consider closing the PR, completing the work, and then submitting a new PR.\nResponding to Feedback: If your PR requires changes based on feedback, continue committing to the same PR unless the changes are substantial. In that case, it might be better to start a new PR.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen contributing to the documentation, ensure your contributions are made within .qmd files. This is essential for the changes to be correctly reflected in the generated documentation through Quarto.\n\n\n\n\nBy contributing to gingado, you are part of a community that values collaboration, innovation, and learning. We look forward to your contributions and are excited to see what we can build together."
