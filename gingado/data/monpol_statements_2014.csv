Poland,2014-01-08,"Warsaw, 8 January 2014 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 7-8 January 2014 The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 2.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 4.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate at 2.75% on an annual basis. Growth in global economic activity remains moderate. As business conditions in the United States have improved markedly, the Federal Reserve has decided to reduce the scale of quantitative easing starting from January 2014. At the same time, the euro area is slowly recovering, yet the pace of the recovery is limited and highly diversified across member countries. In turn, activity in the largest emerging economies  despite some improvement  continues to grow relatively slowly as for these countries. Moderate growth in global economic activity is conducive to inflation staying low in many countries. Data on domestic economic activity in November 2013 indicate a continuation of the gradual recovery in Poland. In particular, data on industrial output and retail sales (in seasonally adjusted terms) suggest that activity in industry and retail sectors has remained on an upward trend. At the same time, decline in construction and assembly output has narrowed, which is indicative of some improvement in this sector. Business climate indicators also signal further growth in economic activity. Ongoing economic recovery translates into an improvement in labour market conditions only to a limited extent. Employment growth remains too weak to bring down the still elevated unemployment rate. High unemployment reduces wage and demand pressures in the economy, while wage growth in the corporate sector remains low. CPI inflation declined to 0.6% in November 2013 (from 0.8% in October), continuing well below the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. This was accompanied by a decrease in most core inflation indices. At the same time, producer prices in industry continued to fall, which indicates low cost pressure in the economy. Inflation expectations stayed low as well. Growth in lending to the private sector remains limited. In November 2013, the annual growth in corporate and household loans was still low. However, since mid-2013 growth in consumer loans has been gradually gathering pace. 1/2 In the opinion of the Council, gradual economic recovery is likely to continue in the coming quarters, however, inflationary pressures will remain subdued. Therefore, the Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council maintains its assessment that NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged at least until the end of the first half of 2014. In the opinion of the Council, lowering interest rates in the first half of 2013 and keeping them unchanged in subsequent quarters supports recovery of the domestic economy, gradual return of inflation to the target and stabilisation in the financial markets."
Romania,2014-01-08,"The NBR reiterates that the adequate use of its available tools amid a close monitoring of domestic and global economic developments is aimed at ensuring price stability over the medium term and financial stability. The analysis of macroeconomic indicators points to further disinflation, as a result of the decline in volatile prices, particularly food prices, as well as of the persistent negative output gap and the significant improvement in inflation expectations. The annual inflation rate fell to 1.83 percent in November 2013, from 1.88 percent in the previous month and the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate stood in negative territory for the second consecutive month. At the same time, the average annual inflation rate went down to 4.3 percent in November 2013, from 4.5 percent in the prior month and the average annual HICP inflation rate, which is relevant for ensuring comparability at EU level and assessing convergence with the EU, continued to decline to reach 3.5 percent in November 2013, from 3.7 percent in October. The economic activity was further bolstered by exports, as well as by the improvement in domestic demand given the increase in household final consumption. On the supply side, the bumper agricultural year and the industrial output made the largest contributions to economic growth. However, the annual rate of change of total loans (in domestic and foreign currency) to the private sector remained in negative territory, despite the relatively improved performance of leu-denominated loans. The decline in interest rates on new loans to companies and households, the successive monetary policy rate cuts and the improved money market liquidity conditions contribute to the positive dynamics of loans in domestic currency. The developments in and the favourable outlook of inflation enabled the central bank to adequately calibrate the monetary policy conduct in 2013 and to consolidate the monetary policy transmission mechanism while effectively anchoring inflation expectations and closely monitoring domestic and external developments. The latest assessments reconfirm the prospects for a further decline in the annual inflation rate to historical lows in the first half of 2014, given the favourable base effect and the impact of the 2013 bumper crop. These developments are in line with the previous forecasts of the annual inflation rate returning and subsequently remaining inside the variation band of the flat 2.5 percent target. The risks associated with the medium-term inflation outlook are primarily related to foreign capital flow volatility, owing to cross-border deleveraging across the banking system and to the variability of investors' risk appetite also following the decisions of the major central banks across the globe. The consistent implementation of an adequate macroeconomic policy mix, in line with the precautionary external financing arrangement signed with the international financial institutions, along with balanced social and political developments during the electoral year 2014, will help consolidate the stability of the Romanian economy, thereby strengthening its resilience to external shocks. Against this backdrop, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 3.75 percent per annum from 4.0 percent previously. Hence, starting with 9 January 2014, the interest rate on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard) will be lowered to an annual 6.75 percent from 7.0 percent, while its deposit facility rate will stand at 0.75 percent per annum. The NBR Board has also decided to continue to pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system. Moreover, in order to support sustainable lending and to bring the minimum reserve requirements mechanism in line with European Central Bank standards in the field, the NBR Board has decided to cut the minimum reserve requirements ratio on leu-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 12 percent from 15 percent and lower the minimum reserve ratio on foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 18 percent from 20 percent starting with the 24 January-23 February 2014 maintenance period. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 4 February 2014, when the new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined.

Euroarea,2014-01-09,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Latvia as the eighteenth country to adopt the euro as its currency. Accordingly. Mr Rimšēvičs, the Governor of Latvijas Banka, became a member of the Governing Council on 1 January 2014. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Incoming information and analysis have continued to confirm our previous assessment. Underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term. In keeping with this picture, monetary and credit dynamics remain subdued. At the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term are firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Such a constellation continues to suggest that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. Against this background, the Governing Council strongly emphasises that it will maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy for as long as necessary, which will assist the gradual economic recovery in the euro area. Accordingly, we firmly reiterate our forward guidance that we continue to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. As previously stated, this expectation is based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. With regard to money market conditions and their potential impact on our monetary policy stance, we are monitoring developments closely and are ready to consider all available instruments. Overall, we remain determined to maintain the high degree of monetary accommodation and to take further decisive action if required. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP in the euro area rose by 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2013, following an increase of 0.3% in the second quarter. While developments in industrial production data for October point to a weak start to the fourth quarter, survey-based confidence indicators up to December have improved further from low levels, overall indicating a continuation of the gradual recovery in economic activity. Looking at 2014 and 2015, output is expected to recover at a slow pace, in particular owing to some improvement in domestic demand supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance. Euro area economic activity should, in addition, benefit from a gradual strengthening of demand for exports. Furthermore, the overall improvements in financial markets seen since the summer of 2012 appear to be working their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. In addition, real incomes have benefited recently from lower energy price inflation. At the same time, unemployment in the euro area remains high, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and the private sector will continue to weigh on economic activity. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. Developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. Other downside risks include higher commodity prices, weaker than expected domestic demand and export growth, and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.8% in December 2013, compared with 0.9% in November. This outcome was broadly as expected and reflected lower services price inflation. On the basis of prevailing futures prices for energy, annual inflation rates are expected to remain at around current levels in the coming months. Over the medium term, underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued. At the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. The risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be seen as broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to higher commodity prices and stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and downside risks stemming from weaker than expected economic activity. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for November support the assessment of continued subdued underlying growth in broad money (M3) and credit. Annual growth in M3 was broadly unchanged at 1.5% in November, after 1.4% in October, following two consecutive declines in September and August. Annual growth in M1 remained strong at 6.5%, reflecting a preference for liquidity, although it was below the peak of 8.7% observed in April 2013. As in previous months, the main factor supporting annual M3 growth was an increase in the MFI net external asset position, which continued to reflect the increased interest of international investors in euro area assets. The annual rate of change of loans to the private sector remained weak. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.3% in November, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -3.1% in November, following -3.0% in October. Overall, weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. Since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks. In order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. The forthcoming comprehensive assessment by the ECB will further support this confidence-building process. It will enhance the quality of information available on the condition of banks and result in the identification and implementation of necessary corrective actions. A timely implementation of further steps to establish a banking union will help to restore confidence in the financial system. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. As regards fiscal policies, it is important not to unravel past efforts but to sustain fiscal consolidation over the medium term. Fiscal strategies should be in line with the fiscal compact and should ensure a growth-friendly composition of consolidation which combines improving the quality and efficiency of public services with minimising distortionary effects of taxation. When accompanied by the decisive implementation of structural reforms, this will further support the gradual economic recovery in the euro area and have a positive impact on public finances. Reforms in product and labour markets and a rigorous enactment of Single Market policies warrant particular focus to improve the outlook for economic growth and to foster job creation in an environment of high unemployment."
South Korea,2014-01-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has become more evident and that the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to have continued to ease, while economic growth trends in emerging market countries, above all China, have been maintained. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the US Federal Reserve's QE tapering. In Korea, the Committee appraises the economic recovery to be continuing in line with the trend of growth, while exports and consumption have continued their uptrends. On the employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded substantially in line with increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for the time being going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will gradually narrow. Consumer price inflation fell slightly from 1.2% the previous month to 1.1% in December, due mainly to a larger extent of decline in the prices of agricultural products and to slowing of the uptrends in prices of industrial products other than petroleum. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also fell slightly, from 2.0% to 1.9%. The Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, although it will remain low for the time being due largely to the stability of international agricultural prices. As for the housing market, sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas maintained their level of the previous month while the uptrend of those in the rest of the country continued. The rise in leasehold-deposit prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas slowed slightly, while in the rest of the country the same trends of increase as in the previous month were seen. In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen substantially, due mainly to concerns about worsening corporate performances in line with the weakness of the Japanese yen and to outflows of foreigner stock investment funds. Long-term market interest rates have fallen considerably, under the influence of foreigners' investment in bond futures. The Korean won has weakened slightly, as the influences of the continued current account surplus and the outflows of foreigners' securities investment funds have overlapped. Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and the influences of external risk factors arising from shifts in major countries' monetary policies, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while supporting the continued recovery of economic growth."
Peru,2014-01-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2014 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.0 percent. This level of the reference rate is compatible with an inflation forecast of 2 percent in the forecast horizon (2014  2015) and takes into account that: inflation expectations remain anchored within the inflation target range; GDP has been recording lower growth rates than the country's potential level of growth; recent indicators show some recovery in the world economy, and the supply factors that affected inflation are reversing. Inflation in December showed a rate of 0.17 percent and thus inflation in the last 12 months declined from 2.96 percent in November to 2.86 percent in December. Inflation without food and energy registered a rate of 0.48 percent (2.97 percent in the last 12 months) and core inflation showed a rate of 0.23 percent (3.74 percent in the last 12 months). Inflation is forecast to remain initially close to the upper band of the target range in the following months due to the lagging effect of the supply shocks and to converge thereafter to the 2 percent target in 2014. A slowdown has been observed in the pace of economic growth until the third quarter of 2013 as a result of the lower growth of our exports due to the deceleration of economic activity in our main trading partners and due to lower export prices. Indicators of activity at December indicate a recovery of economic activity in the last quarter. The rate of maximum mean reserve requirements and marginal reserve requirements in domestic currency was lowered from 15 to 14 percent in January with the purpose of supporting the dynamism of credit in soles. Moreover, the rate of reserve requirements for foreign trade liabilities was lowered from 20 to 14 percent. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants and, if necessary, will implement additional measures to ease its monetary policy instruments. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to reduce the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.20 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Monetary Program for the following twelve months will be approved on the Board meetings to be held according to the following schedule: February 13 March 13 April 10 May 8 June 12 July 10 August 7 September 11 October 9 November 13 December 11 January 8 (2015) In 2014 the BCRP will publish its Inflation Reports on the following dates: April 25 July 18 October 17 January 16 (2015)."
Chile,2014-01-16,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 16 January 2014 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 4.5% (annual). In the global economy, incoming figures are consistent with the scenario depicted in our Monetary Policy Report. Our trading partners' growth is expected to recover in the coming quarters, grounded in the rebound of developed economies, especially the United States, and stabilized growth in emerging markets. The Federal Reserve cut down the amount of monthly asset purchases, which had no major impact on long-term international interest rates. Inflation in advanced economies has remained low, so a slow normalization of monetary policy is foreseen there. Financial conditions in the more vulnerable emerging economies are still tight, while those facing peripheral Europe have improved. During the last month, the copper price rose, contrasting with reduced prices of oil and foodstuffs. The dollar appreciated in international markets. The Chilean economy has continued to lose strength. Domestic output and demand have grown somewhat less than assumed in the Monetary Policy Report, particularly in investment- related sectors. CPI figures of the past two months have driven headline inflation to 3% annually, reflecting the impact of some factors associated with its most volatile components (i.e. foodstuffs and energy), as well as the short-term incidence of the peso depreciation. Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain around the target over the projection horizon, and the pace of nominal wages' growth shows a moderation in recent months. The Board estimates that in the coming months it might be necessary to increase the monetary stimulus to ensure that projected inflation will stand at 3% in the policy horizon. Accordingly, any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Hungary,2014-01-21,"At its meeting on 21 January 2014, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 15 basis points from 3.00% to 2.85%, with effect from 22 January 2014. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue this year and next. While the pace of activity is strengthening, the level of output remains below its potential and is likely to return close to that level at the end of the horizon relevant for monetary policy. With employment rising steadily, the unemployment rate is falling, but still exceeds its long-term level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain subdued over the medium term. Inflation continued to fall in December, mainly as a result of the reduction in regulated energy prices in November. In addition to the temporary factors reducing inflation, the Bank's measures of underlying inflation capturing the medium-term outlook also indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy, which reflects the effects of weak domestic demand and low inflation in external markets. The persistently low inflation environment may facilitate the adjustment of inflation expectations. The rate of private sector wage growth has picked up slightly recently, but still remains moderate. Domestic real economic factors are expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact, although to a declining extent, as activity rises further. Incoming data showed that economic growth continued in the fourth quarter, as reflected by monthly data on industrial production, the trade surplus, construction output and retail trade turnover. Economic growth is expected to continue in the quarters ahead, and is likely to be more balanced than previously. Domestic demand is expected to grow over the next years, in addition to rising exports. With the increase in corporate investment due to the Funding for Growth Scheme and the Government's infrastructure projects using EU funding, the recovery in household consumption is likely to be gradual. Growth in real income is expected to be partly offset by the ongoing reduction in debt accumulated during the years prior to the crisis and the slow easing in tight credit conditions. Global investor sentiment has remained supportive, despite the Fed's decision to reduce the pace of its asset purchases at the end of last year. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy improved, as reflected in the declines in CDS spreads and bond yields. Hungary's persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt act to reduce the country's vulnerability. In the Council's judgement, a cautious approach to policy is warranted due to uncertainty related to the global financial environment. In the Council's judgement, there remains a significant degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over a sustained period. Delivering price stability in the medium term points in the direction of monetary easing. The global financial environment remained supportive. A sustained and marked shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. Considering the outlook for inflation and taking into account perceptions of the risks associated with the economy as well as the improvement in the pace of economic growth, further cautious easing of monetary policy may follow, but a reduction in the increment has become warranted."
Turkiye,2014-01-21,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 7.75 percent, borrowing rate at 3.5 percent, and the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 6.75 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 4.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 10.25 percent. Recent data suggest that final domestic demand and exports continued to grow at a moderate pace during the fourth quarter. The cautious monetary policy stance, the announced macroprudential measures, and weak capital flows lead to a gradual slowdown in loan growth. Accordingly, the decline in the current account deficit excluding gold trade is expected to continue in 2014. The Committee monitors the impact of the recent increase in the risk premium on the inflation outlook and expectations. Inflation is likely to hover above the 5 percent target for some time due to recent tax adjustments and lagged effects of exchange rate developments. The Committee stated that the liquidity stance should be tightened to align inflation outlook with the medium term targets. To this end, interbank money market interest rates will materialize at 9 percent during additional monetary tightening days, instead of 7.75 percent (the marginal funding rate). It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2014-01-27,"The inflation rate in 2013 was 1.8 percent. Inflation expectations for one year ahead, from various sources, are all slightly below the midpoint of the inflation target. Data which became available this month indicate continued growth of the economy at a moderate rate, with some improvement in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with the preceding quarter. The picture in the fourth quarter regarding exports is better than it was in the third quarter, but therewas some moderation again in December. Over the longer term there has essentially been a standstill in exports, against the background of moderate growth of world trade and the appreciation of the shekel. The unemployment rate continued to decline and is at a low level, though various indicators, such as job vacancies and health tax receipts, indicate some labor market weakness. Since the last monetary policy discussion, the shekel appreciated by 1 percent against the dollar, while the dollar strengthened against most major currencies worldwide. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel appreciated by 1.5 percent. After two years during which all the revisions to their forecasts were downward, the World Bank and the IMF this month revised their global growth projections upward. With that, the revision was moderate and projected world trade growth was revised downward. Major central banks continue to express their commitment to leaving monetary interest rates at a low level foran extended period of time. Despite the beginning of Federal Reserve tapering of bond purchases in the US, long-term yields declined this month. After data in the previous month had indicated some moderation, therewas an increase this month in home prices and in mortgages granted. The number of transactions and the share of investors in those transactions also began to increase again. Against the background of the Supervisor of Banks directives regarding housing credit, the trend of decline continues in new mortgages' risk characteristics, such as the average loan to value ratio, the payment to income ratio, and the share of mortgages granted at variable rate interest. To view this press release as a Word document. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.1 percent in December, slightly below forecasters' projections, which were for an increase of 0.2 percent, on average. There were marked increasesin the clothing and footwear, and fruit and vegetables components, and marked declines in the furniture, healthcare, and education, culture and entertainment components. The rate of inflation for 2013 as a whole was 1.8 percent, slightly below the midpoint of the inflation target range. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Private forecasters' inflation projections for the next 12 CPI readings declined slightly this month, averaging 1.7 percent. Inflation expectations derived from the capital market remained at 1.6 percent, while expectations for the next 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates increased slightly to 1.4 percent. Inflation expectations for medium and long terms remained essentially unchanged this month, and remain slightly above the midpoint of the inflation target range. Private forecasters' projections, as well as data derived from the Telbor interest rates and the makam curve, indicate some probability of one reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate in the coming two months. Real economic activity: Data that became available this month indicate that the economy is continuing to grow at a moderate pace, with improvement in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with the third quarter. Goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft and diamonds) declined in dollar terms by 7 percent in December, but their level in the fourth quarter was 8 percent higher than in the third quarter. Exports of business services (excludingstartup companies) increased by 0.7 percent in November. Goods imports (excluding ships, aircraft, diamonds and fuels) declined by 1.2 percent in December, but increased by 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter compared with thethird quarter. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased in December by 0.2 percent, a similar rate to previous months. The Industrial Production Index declined between January and November by 0.7 percent compared to the corresponding period in 2012. The Climate Index, based on the Business Tendency Survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics, was unchanged in January, and since the beginning of 2013 has continued to fluctuate in a rangeindicating a 0.25 to 0.3 percent monthly rate of growth. The Purchasing Managers Index increased slightly in December, but remains situated in a range indicating contraction in manufacturing activity. Consumer Confidence indices compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics and by Bank Hapoalim continued to indicate pessimism in consumers' expectations in December. The labor market: Labor Force Survey data for November indicate that the employment rate among the principal working ages (25-64) increased by 0.2 percentage points, and that the unemployment rate declined to 5 percent among this group. The overall unemployment rate also declined, reaching 5.5 percent. At the same time, there was a slight decline in the share of those employed on a full time basis, and quarterly data (up to the third quarter) indicate a decline in the number of hours per employed personin the business sector. In October, the number of employee posts in publicservices declined by 1.3 percent, while the number of employee posts in the business sector increased by 1.2 percent, following previous months in which these trends were reversed. Nominal wages increased by 1.2 percent, andreal wages increased by 0.6 percent, in August-October, compared with May-July. The rate of increase in health tax receipts by the National Insurance Institute, which provide an indication of total wage payments in the economy, renewed a trend of decline: they were 3.6 percent higher in November-December, on a nominal basis, than in the corresponding two months of the previous year, compared with a 6.1 percent yearover year increase in September-October. The number of job vacancies in the business sector declined by 7.4 percent in December, to its lowest level in 2013. Budget data: In 2013 as a whole, the net overall government deficit excluding credit was 3.15 percent of GDP, compared with 4.33 percent (adjusted for the new methodology of measuring GDP) which was planned for in the budget. Direct tax revenues were higher than forecast, and even though the indirect tax revenues were lower than forecast, total revenue was NIS 5.8 billion greater than forecast, mainly as a result of one-time factors. Expenses underperformed the budget by NIS 6.7 billion, but ministry expenditures excluding the 'miscellaneous' item were in line with expenditures planned in the budget. Excluding legislative changes and one-timerevenues, total tax collection in 2013 increased by about 1.9 percent compared with 2012. In December. VAT receipts on domestic production increased by about 3.2 percent in real terms compared with December 2012, excluding legislative changes. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on December 22, 2013, through January 24, 2014, the shekel appreciated by 1 percent against the dollar, while the dollar strengthened against most major currencies. The shekel strengthened by 0.6 percent against the euro, and appreciated by about 1.5 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchangerate, against the background of sharp weakening in several currencies included in the index. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussionon December 22, 2013, through January 24, 2014, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by 0.85 percent, while returns were mixed worldwide with a tendency toward increases in developed markets. There were slight changes in government bond yields, with a slight steepening of the CPI-indexed curve, and declines in yields for most terms on the unindexed curve, though by less than the global trend. The yield to maturity on a 10-year unindexed bond is currently 3.62 percent. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli governmentbonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities increased slightly, to 90 basis points. Makam yields increased slightly along the entire curve. The 1-year yield increased slightly during the period to 0.89 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread continued to decline, to only 95 basis points. The Tel-Bond 60 Index increased by 0.23 percent. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in December, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 15.4 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 6.6 percent. Developments in the credit markets: Total outstanding debt of the business sector increased by about NIS 4.4 billion (0.6 percent) in November, to NIS 783 billion. The increase derived from an increase in bank creditfollowing a decline in the previous month, and from funds raised directly through loans from institutional investors totaling about NIS 1 billion, which was slightly offset by a decline in CPI-indexed debt due to a decline in the CPI in November. In December, the private nonfinancial sector issued about NIS 3.1 billion in bonds, all in tradable bonds, which is greater than the monthly average since the beginning of the year of about NIS 2.4 billion. For the year as a whole, bond issues totaled about NIS 30 billion, about NIS 2 billion more than in 2012. However, net bond issuance since the beginning of the year was negative, while there was continued rapid growth indirect loans, which increased by NIS 10 billion. In January, a decline in corporate bond spreads resumed, following a halt in the fourth quarter of 2013. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 0.5 billion (0.1 percent) in November, to about NIS 407 billion, with an increase of about NIS 1.2 billion (0.4 percent) in the balance of housing debt, to NIS 287 billion. In December, there were about NIS 4.7 billion in new mortgages taken out. In 2013 as a whole, there were about NIS 51.7 billion in new mortgages taken out, compared with about NIS 46.6 billion in 2012. The trend of declinecontinues in new mortgages' risk characteristics, such as the loanto value ratio, the payment to income ratio, and the share of mortgages granted at variable rate interest. The average interest rate on new unindexedmortgages declined by about 0.05 percentage points, while in the CPI-indexed track, the average interest rate declined by 0.04 percentage points following increases in the two previous months. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) declined by 0.3 percent in December. In the full year of 2013, this component increased by 2.9 percent, compared with an increase of 3.5 percent in the 12 months ended in November. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased by 0.5 percent in October-November, following a decline in the previous figure. Over the 12 months ending in November, prices increased by 8 percent, compared with an increase of 8.6 percent in the 12 months ended in October. In October and November, the number of transactions began to increase again, as did investors' share in transactions. The global economy: After two years during which their forecasts were only revised downward, the World Bank and the IMF this month revised their global growth projections upward, albeit moderately; with that, projected growth of world trade continued to be revised downward. The upward revision in growth forecasts derived from an improvement in US economic activityin recent months and from the improvement becoming apparent in the state of the Eurozone economy: and notwithstanding the weakness in emergingmarkets. The IMF increased its 2014 growth forecast for the US by 0.2 percentage points, to 2.8 percent, and assessed that the growth would be based on recovery in personal and public consumption and in the balance of trade.With that, the IMF reduced its forecast for 2015 by 0.4 percentage points,to 3 percent. An addition of 74,000 new jobs was disappointing, apparentlyaffected by the severe weather conditions during the month. The decline inunemployment derives primarily from a decline in labor force participation, but at the same time there was an increase in overtime hours. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes indicate that Committee members expect the federal funds rate to begin to be increased around the middle of 2015. InEurope, the IMF forecasts 1 percent growth in 2014. Data published this month indicate a mixed picture. There was decline in the Purchasing Managers Index for the services sector, an additional deterioration in bank credit, and unemployment remained at a record high level of 12.1 percent. Yet at the same time, there was continued increase in the Purchasing Managers Index for manufacturing, and improvements in industrial production, consumer confidence, and retail sales. In Japan, there are increasing signs that the fiscal and monetary expansion policies there are succeeding, as reflected in an increase in exports and manufacturing output. In emerging markets, the slowdown in growth continues, and the World Bank reduced its growth forecast for those economies to 5.3 percent, from 5.6 percent. In China, growth in 2013 was only 7.7 percent. In Brazil, activity indicated slight improvement,but the overall picture is still not encouraging, and in India, as well, it is still too early to establish that the trend of moderation has halted. There were not any extraordinary fluctuations in the capital markets this month, and so it appears that the start of the tapering process had already been priced in by the markets. With that, in the last two days of trading there were sales in equities markets and a decline in bond yields in the US and Europe, apparently due to data indicating the moderation of growth in China and due to disappointing corporate results in the US. There was also depreciation in the currencies of emerging markets, against the background of domestic events, among other things. While in Japan price indices increased, in the US, and primarily in Europe, there was increased concern of low inflation, and in Europe there is even concern of deflation. This month, oil prices declined by 4 percent and agricultural commodity prices declined by 3 percent. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for February 2014 unchanged at 1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: The inflation rate in 2013 was 1.8 percent. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decisionfor February 2014 will be published on February 10, 2014.

India,2014-01-28,"Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2013-14 : Statement by Dr. Raghuram G. Rajan. Governor. Reserve Bank of India Good morning and welcome to the Reserve Bank. Today, on the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, we have decided to increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 8.0 per cent. Let me first address the balance of risks that confronts us in the evolving macroeconomic outlook. The slowdown in the economy is getting increasingly worrisome. Our current assessment is that growth is likely to lose momentum in Q3 of 2013-14, with industrial activity in contractionary mode, mainly on account of manufacturing. Lead indicators of services also suggest a subdued outlook, barring some pick-up in transport and communication activity. On the other hand, agricultural performance has so far been robust, and the strong pick-up in rabi sowing indicates that this should be sustained. Another silver lining is the significant narrowing of the trade deficit on the back of resilient export growth. The current account deficit for 2013-14 is now expected to be below 2.5 per cent of GDP as compared with 4.8 per cent in 2012-13. The recent resumption of capital inflows should help finance the current account deficit comfortably. Reserves have been rebuilt since September, and are expected to increase further as oil marketing companies, that have been buying foreign exchange in the market, repay the Reserve Bank when their swaps come due. Nevertheless, given the uncertain external environment, the government and the RBI cannot pause in their efforts to ensure fiscal and monetary stability. The gravest risk to the value of the rupee is from CPI inflation which remains elevated at close to double digits, despite the anticipated disinflation in vegetable and fruit prices. Moreover, inflation excluding food and fuel has also been high, especially in respect of services, indicative of wage pressures and other second round effects. Elevated levels of inflation erode household budgets and constrict the purchasing power of consumers. This, in turn, discourages investment and weakens growth. High inflation weakens the rupee. Inflation is also a tax that is grossly inequitable, falling hardest on the very poor. It is only by bringing down inflation to a low and stable level that monetary policy can contribute to reviving consumption and investment in a sustainable way. The so-called trade-off between inflation and growth is a false trade- off in the long run. It is possible to bring inflation under control without a substantial sacrifice of short term growth, provided we do what is necessary, and are patient. In the Mid- Quarter Review on December 18, 2013, the policy decision was to wait for more data, and we offered guidance on what we would do contingent on the data. Although headline inflation has fallen significantly with the substantial fall in vegetable prices,2015 and below 6 per cent CPI inflation by January 2016. The Reserve Bank's baseline projections set out in the accompanying Review of Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments for Q3 of 2013-14 indicate that over the ensuing 12-month horizon, and with an unchanged policy stance, there are upside risks to the central forecast of 8 per cent. Accordingly, an increase in the policy rate by 25 basis points is needed to set the economy securely on the recommended disinflationary path. If the disinflationary process evolves according to this baseline projection, further policy tightening in the near term is not anticipated at this juncture. In fact, if inflation eases at a pace that is faster than we currently anticipate, and that reduction is expected to be sustained, the Reserve Bank will have room to become more accommodative. Of course, the Reserve Bank is fostering growth through steady reforms. For example, last week, cash settled interest rate futures started trading on various exchanges. The enhanced framework for resolution of distressed assets will be operational by April 1. The recommendations of the Dr.Nachiket Mor Committee on financial inclusion are being examined carefully as are the recommendations of the Dr.Urjit Patel Committee on the monetary policy framework. On behalf of the Reserve Bank. I wish you all a very happy new year. Alpana Killawala Press Release : 2013-2014/1510 Principal Chief General Manager."
Turkiye,2014-01-28,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to adjust the short term interest rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate is increased from 7.75 percent to 12 percent, borrowing rate from 3.5 percent to 8 percent, and the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions from 6.75 to 11.5 percent. b) One-week repo rate is increased from 4.5 percent to 10 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate is kept at 0 percent, lending rate is increased from 10.25 percent to 15 percent. Recent domestic and external developments are having an adverse impact on risk perceptions, leading to a significant depreciation in the Turkish lira and a pronounced increase in the risk premium. The Central Bank will implement necessary measures at its disposal to contain the negative impact of these developments on inflation and macroeconomic stability. In this respect, the Committee decided to implement a strong monetary tightening and to simplify the operational framework. Accordingly, one-week repo rate is increased from 4.5 percent to 10 percent; the Central Bank liquidity will be provided primarily from one-week repo rate instead of the marginal funding rate in the forthcoming period. Tight monetary policy stance will be sustained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. Under this policy stance, inflation is expected to reach the 5 percent target by mid-2015. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Malaysia,2014-01-29,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. In the major advanced economies, broader signs of improvement have emerged. The Asian economies have continued to experience sustained growth although growth in domestic demand in some economies are showing signs of moderation. In recent weeks, shifts in global liquidity have resulted in increased volatility and uncertainties in the international financial markets. Looking ahead, global growth will be supported by the emerging economies and the recovery in the advanced economies. Nevertheless, global economic and financial conditions remain vulnerable to shifts in sentiments and heightened volatility in the international financial markets. For the Malaysian economy, indicators suggest that the economy registered sustained performance in the fourth quarter of 2013. Improvements in exports have supported economic growth during the quarter while domestic demand remained firm. Going forward, the growth momentum is expected to continue in 2014, amid better performance in the external sector. Investment activity is also projected to remain robust, led by capital spending by the private sector, particularly in the mining, manufacturing and services sectors. Domestic demand, however, is expected to moderate, reflecting the ongoing public sector consolidation and a slower growth in private consumption. Inflation rose to 3.2% in December 2013 to average at 2.1% for the year as a whole. Inflation has been gradually rising due to disruptions in supply following adverse weather conditions and higher domestic costs. Going forward, inflation is expected to average higher largely due to domestic cost factors. The subdued external price pressures and moderate domestic demand conditions will help contain the impact of these cost factors on underlying inflation. The MPC will continue to carefully evaluate the global and domestic economic and financial developments and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy. The MPC remains focused on ensuring medium-term price stability that would contribute to sustainable economic growth. Bank Negara Malaysia 29 January 2014."
United States,2014-01-29,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that growth in economic activity picked up in recent quarters. Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. The unemployment rate declined but remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced more quickly in recent months, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having become more nearly balanced. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment since the inception of its current asset purchase program, the Committee continues to see the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in February, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $30 billion per month rather than $35 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $35 billion per month rather than $40 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. The Committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

South Africa,2014-01-29,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 29 January 2014 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the expected cutback in quantitative easing by the US Fed has begun. Although the initial response in global financial markets was generally fairly muted, emerging markets have subsequently experienced a high degree of turbulence, particularly in the wake of renewed fears of a slowdown in China. While the Fed action signals a recovery in the US, and the UK economic outlook is also improving, it does not mean that the global financial crisis is over. Rather, we are now entering a phase of the crisis that is creating new challenges for emerging market economies. In the longer run a sustained recovery in the US should be positive for the global economy in general, but the adjustment to the withdrawal of quantitative easing is likely to create significant short to medium-term challenges. How to respond to a 2 combination of sharply depreciating currencies, capital outflows, slowing growth, rising inflation, significant current account and/or fiscal deficits and deteriorating confidence is posing policy challenges and very difficult trade-offs for many emerging markets. The rand exchange rate has been one of the currencies affected by these developments, and the recent depreciation of the rand, if sustained, will raise significantly the risk to the inflation outlook. Our inflation forecast shows a marked deterioration, despite the absence of clear evidence of domestic demand pressures. The recent inflation data reflects positive outcomes that belie the incipient risks, largely from the depreciation of the currency, that our forecasts highlight. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 5,3 per cent in November 2013 and 5,4 per cent in December, resulting in an average annual inflation rate of 5,7 per cent for 2013. Food and non-alcoholic beverage price inflation continued to moderate from a recent peak of 7,1 per cent in August, to 3,8 per cent in November and 3,5 per cent in December. The contribution of this category to the average CPI increase was 0,5 percentage points in December compared with 0,6 percentage points in the previous month. The petrol price, which was the main contributor to the higher overall inflation in December, increased at a year-on-year rate of 10,0 per cent, up from 7,7 per cent in November. Core inflation, which excludes food. MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 2. Core inflation, which excludes food. MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 2 3 petrol and electricity, has been unchanged at 5,3 per cent for the four months to December, while administered price inflation excluding petrol measured 6,8 per cent. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 5,8 per cent in November, compared with 6,3 per cent in October. The headline inflation forecast of the Bank has deteriorated since the previous meeting of the MPC, mainly as a result of revisions to the assumptions regarding the rand exchange rate. The forecast average inflation rate for 2014 is 0,6 percentage points higher at 6,3 per cent, and 0,6 percentage points higher at 6,0 per cent in 2015, with inflation expected to average 5,9 per cent in the final quarter of that year. Inflation is expected breach the upper end of the target range in the second quarter of 2014, and to reach a peak of 6,6 per cent in the final quarter of the year, before declining to 6,0 per cent in the second quarter of 2015. Core inflation, which averaged 5,2 per cent in 2013, is expected to average 5,8 per cent in 2014, compared with 5,6 per cent in the previous forecast, while the forecast for 2015 has increased from 5,3 per cent to 5,9 per cent. The deterioration in this measure of underlying inflation continues to be driven primarily by the lagged effects of the depreciation of the rand exchange rate. Inflation expectations appear to have remained relatively anchored at the upper end of the target range. According to the survey conducted in the fourth quarter MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 3. According to the survey conducted in the fourth quarter MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 3 4 of 2013 by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University, average inflation expectations of respondents measured 6,1 per cent for both 2014 and 2015 and have remained more or less unchanged since 2011. There is, however, some divergence between the average expectations of respondents, which range between 5,6 per cent and 6,4 per cent in 2014, and 5,5 per cent and 6,5 per cent in 2015. Financial analysts have the lowest forecasts, which are also reflected in the latest Reuters survey that indicates expectations of 5,6 per cent and 5,5 per cent in 2014 and 2015 respectively. While the economic growth outlook for a number of emerging market economies has deteriorated somewhat in recent months, the prospects in the advanced economies have improved, particularly in the US and the UK. However, the recovery remains uneven and not without risks. In the US, growth is being driven by a recovery in the housing market, robust private sector demand, and a dissipation of the negative impulse from fiscal consolidation. In its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) update, the IMF forecasts growth of 2,8 per cent in 2014 for the US, compared with 1,9 per cent in 2013. The outlook for the Eurozone remains fragile and uneven, particularly in the Southern periphery where the risk of deflation, strong fiscal consolidation and weak banking sectors are constraining the recovery. Eurozone growth in 2014 is expected to remain subdued at around 1,0 per cent. MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 4. MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 4 5 The Japanese economy has maintained its positive growth but there are still doubts about its sustainability in the absence of continued fiscal stimulus. The outlook for the Chinese economy is increasingly uncertain, given the challenge of containing the excessive increase in credit extension without adversely impacting on growth. Although a growth rate of around 7,5 per cent is still generally expected, the latest PMI, which suggests a contraction of industrial production, indicates some downside risk to this outlook. This uncertainty has contributed to increased risk aversion and volatility in financial markets of emerging economies in recent weeks, and is also likely to impact negatively on commodity prices. Significant currency depreciation and weaker growth prospects are also evident in a number of other large emerging economies, particularly Brazil. Russia and Turkey, while the outlook for the Indian economy appears to have improved somewhat. Global inflation remains benign despite abundant liquidity. However, spillover effects from increasingly divergent monetary policies are creating a difficult and volatile environment for emerging markets. There is still some uncertainty regarding the pace of tapering by the Fed in the coming months, and although market expectations are that the US policy rate is unlikely to increase before at least mid-2015, long term bond yields have increased to around 2,8 per cent from around 1,6 per cent in May 2013. A further sustained improvement in UK growth and employment trends has brought forward the prospect of monetary tightening MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 5. A further sustained improvement in UK growth and employment trends has brought forward the prospect of monetary tightening MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 5 6 by the Bank of England. However, monetary policy is expected to remain highly accommodative in Japan and the Eurozone where the risk of deflation persists. The expectation of tapering by the Fed since May 2013 resulted in significant outflows from emerging economies domestic bond and equity markets, putting pressure on exchange rates and long term bond yields, particularly in those countries with sizeable current account deficits. Some countries, including Brazil. Turkey. Indonesia and India, responded by tightening monetary policy, either in reaction to inflationary pressures or in an attempt to stem the depreciation. Since May 2013, cumulative interest rate increases have amounted to 300 basis points in Brazil and 75 basis points in India. The most recent instance has been Turkey which raised its overnight interest rate (MFR) by 425 basis points to 12 per cent. The impact of these developments on the rand exchange rate has resulted in a marked increase in the upside risk to the inflation forecast, despite the relatively muted pass-through to date. Since the previous MPC meeting, the rand has depreciated by about 7,4 per cent against the US dollar, by 9,0 per cent against the euro and by 8,0 per cent on a trade weighted basis. Year to date the rand/dollar depreciation has been about 3,5 per cent. In the final two months of 2013, total net sales by non-residents of South African domestic government bonds and equities amounted to R21,0 bn and R19,4bn respectively. These flows effectively reversed the inflows that occurred during the MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 6. These flows effectively reversed the inflows that occurred during the MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 6 7 earlier part of the year, with net purchases of bond and equities for 2013 by non- residents amounting to R1,3 bn, compared with R85,2 bn for 2012. Year-to-date net sales of equities and bonds have totaled R19,3 bn, of which R15,6 bn were bonds. While the recent rand weakness is part of a general emerging market phenomenon, it has been reinforced by idiosyncratic factors including declining terms of trade, on-going labour disputes, and the higher-than-expected current account deficit in the third quarter. Although to date the current account has been slow to react to the depreciation of the rand, the trade surplus of R0,8 bn recorded in November may signify a possible narrowing of the current account deficit in the fourth quarter of 2013. However, given the volatility of the monthly trade data, it is too early to assess whether or not this is the beginning of a sustainable trend. The extent to which the strikes in the mining sector and resulting decline in exports are likely to impede the current account adjustment further will depend on the duration of the strikes and the extent to which lost output can be compensated for by running down inventories. The economic growth outlook remains subdued amid continued low business confidence. Growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 is estimated to have recovered somewhat from the low base of 0,7 per cent in the third quarter, and annual MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 7. Growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 is estimated to have recovered somewhat from the low base of 0,7 per cent in the third quarter, and annual MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 7 8 growth in 2013 is estimated to have been around 1,9 per cent. Although an improved outcome is forecast for 2014, growth is still expected to remain below estimated potential output of between 3,0 and 3,5 per cent. The Bank’s forecasts for growth in 2014 and 2015 have been revised to 2,8 per cent and 3,3 per cent respectively, down from 3,0 per cent and 3,4 per cent in the previous forecast round. The Bank’s composite leading business cycle indicator continues to trend sideways, and was marginally negative in November. The mining sector is expected to remain under pressure in the face of work stoppages in the major platinum mines, with the risk of these disruptions spreading to the gold mines. Mining output recovered somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2013 from the September lows, and the sector is expected to have made a positive contribution to fourth quarter growth. The manufacturing sector is also expected to have exhibited stronger growth in the final quarter, following the strike-induced contraction in the third quarter. However, the sector has yet to exhibit a meaningful response to the weaker exchange rate, and the Kagiso PMI declined to just below 50 index points in December, for the first time since April 2013. The construction sector presents a mixed picture. The FNB/BER building confidence index remained unchanged at 48 index points in the fourth quarter of 2013, the highest level in 5 years. However, the upward trend in the real value of building plans passed observed in the earlier part of 2013 has leveled off, and MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 8. However, the upward trend in the real value of building plans passed observed in the earlier part of 2013 has leveled off, and MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 8 9 there was a notable decline in November by 12,5 per cent on a month-to-month basis, and a 14,5 per cent decline on a year-on-year basis. The outlook for civil construction, by contrast, appears to be more favourable. These restrained developments in the real sector have contributed to the slow pace of employment creation in the economy, and continued job losses in the private sector remain a concern. According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics (QES) survey of Statistics South Africa, formal sector employment increased by 13,400 in the year to the third quarter of 2013, or by 0,2 per cent. In the third quarter of 2013, employment losses were most pronounced in mining and construction. Growth in consumption expenditure by households moderated from 2,8 per cent in the second quarter to 2,3 per cent in the third quarter, and is expected to remain relatively constrained by disappointing employment growth and a modest rise in credit extension. Slow growth was particularly evident in the consumption of non-durable goods and services. Real expenditure on durable goods remained strong, with growth of 9,3 per cent. Nevertheless, domestic new vehicles sales appear to be under pressure, having contracted by 3,3 per cent on a quarter-to- quarter basis in the final quarter of 2013. Although retail trade sales increased by 1,2 per cent on a month-to-month basis in November 2013, they increased only marginally, by 0,1 per cent, when the three months to November are compared to the previous three months. Consumer confidence, as reflected in the FNB/BER MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 9. Consumer confidence, as reflected in the FNB/BER MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 9 10 consumer confidence index, remained at a low level of -7, a marginal improvement from the previous quarter. Growth in credit extension by the banking system to the private sector continued to lose momentum. Twelve-month growth in total loans and advances to the private sector moderated to 7,4 per cent in November, with credit extension to households measuring 5,9 per cent, compared with 10,4 per cent at the same time in 2012. Twelve-month growth in general loans to households, mainly unsecured lending, measured 8,1 per cent in November, the lowest rate of growth since April 2009, while annualised growth over three months showed a contraction of 0,8 per cent. Although there has been an increase in commercial mortgage credit extension, growth in outstanding residential mortgages remains subdued at 1,3 per cent. Instalment sale credit and leasing finance has continued to be relatively brisk, but could moderate if motor vehicle demand continues to decline. Household debt as a percentage of household disposable income declined slightly from 75,8 per cent in the second quarter to 75,5 per cent in the third quarter of 2013. Wage settlement rates, as measured by Andrew Levy Employment Publications, measured 7,9 per cent during 2013. However, according to QES data, growth in nominal remuneration per worker declined from 8,8 per cent in the year to the second quarter of 2013, to 6,6 per cent in the year to the third quarter. For the economy as a whole, despite a small decline in labour productivity growth, unit MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 10. For the economy as a whole, despite a small decline in labour productivity growth, unit MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 10 11 labour cost growth declined over the year from 6,9 per cent in the second quarter to 4,9 per cent in the third quarter. However there are important sectoral differences. For instance, unit labour cost growth in the manufacturing sector accelerated from 5,6 per cent to 6,9 per cent during the same period, while nominal remuneration per worker in the mining sector increased by 9,0 per cent. Food prices have been the main contributor to the downside surprises in inflation in the past two months, with prices increasing by 3,5 per cent in December. Global food prices generally declined during the year amid improved wheat and maize harvests. The rand exchange rate, coupled with disappointing domestic harvests due to drought in some areas, has impacted adversely on the domestic maize and wheat prices in recent weeks, with the spot prices of maize increasing by about 12 per cent during January, following increases of around 20 per cent between August and December 2013. These pressures have not as yet been observed in the producer price index where cereal and other crop prices declined by one per cent over the year in November. Persistent drought conditions in a number of regions have resulted in the culling of cattle, leading to extremely low meat price inflation since September (0,1 per cent in December). However, these favourable food price outcomes are not expected to persist as higher spot grain prices work through to consumer prices. Although the exchange rate pass-through has generally been relatively muted to date, the impact on the petrol price has been almost immediate. International oil MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 11. International oil MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 11 12 prices have been fairly stable, with Brent crude oil trading in a range of between US$106 and US$109 during January. In December and January the domestic petrol price was increased by a cumulative 55 cent per litre, and a further significant increase, in excess of 30 cents per litre, can be expected in February, primarily as a result of the weaker exchange rate. Sustained upside pressure from petrol prices on inflation can therefore be anticipated should the rand continue to depreciate. The MPC carefully considered the economic challenges facing South Africa and the appropriate policy response. On the one hand, inflation forecasts indicate the possibility of being out of the target range for an extended period, largely due to the impact of the depreciating currency. The risks to the inflation forecast are seen to be significantly on the upside. Large adjustments to the exchange rate will inevitably impact on inflation, even in conditions of relatively low pass-through such as we have been experiencing. On the other hand, the growth outlook remains of concern. Credit extension is low and declining, few jobs on a net basis are being created, and gross fixed capital formation, particularly from the private sector, is significantly below what is required. Capital outflows and a current account deficit exacerbate the difficulties that lie ahead. Exchange rate pressures are expected to intensify as markets adjust to the new pattern of global capital flows. Although monetary policy in the advanced MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 12. Although monetary policy in the advanced MPC Statement January 29th 2014 Page 12 13 economies remains accommodative, the process of normalisation has begun, and the spillovers have implications for our own monetary policy. The primary responsibility of the Bank is to keep inflation under control and ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored. The depreciation experienced so far could improve our international competitiveness, provided that it is not eroded through higher wage and other input prices. In the light of these circumstances and taking account of policy trade-offs, the MPC has decided to increase the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 5,5 per cent per annum as of 30 January 2014. The MPC is of the view that, notwithstanding this increase in the repo rate, monetary policy remains accommodative. Further moves in the repo rate will be highly data dependent. We will continue to monitor developments closely and will not hesitate to act as required in keeping with our mandate. Gill Marcus GOVERNOR Contact person: Candice Jeffreys +27 12 313 4209 Candice.

Romania,2014-02-04,"The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for 6 February 2014. The latest macroeconomic data point to faster disinflation attributed to the influence of one-off factors (above-average crops in 2013, the cut in VAT rate for bread, flour and some bakery products, the base effects deriving from the weak harvest of 2012, and the increase in the electricity price in December 2012) and persistent factors (the negative output gap, inflation expectations). Annual inflation rate dropped to 1.55 percent in December 2013 from 1.83 percent a month earlier. Furthermore, the average annual inflation rate declined to 4.0 percent in December 2013 against 4.3 percent in the previous month, and the average annual inflation rate measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices, a relevant indicator to ensure EU-wide comparability and to assess the degree of convergence with the European Union, remained on a downward trend to stand at 3.2 percent in the final month of 2013, from 3.5 percent in November. The significant improvement in the path of inflation and the related outlook has enabled the central bank to gradually adjust the monetary policy stance over the past few months, while effectively anchoring inflation expectations and closely monitoring domestic and external developments. As for economic growth, in 2013, exports were the driving force behind the pick-up in economic activity in Romania, having a further favourable impact on the current account, whereas consumption and investment are envisaged to recover gradually. Lending to the private sector saw however negative annual dynamics in real terms, despite a slightly improving trend in lei-denominated loans. The successive monetary policy rate cuts have favourably fed through, albeit with a certain lag, to lending rates across the real sector, thus confirming the consolidation of the transmission of the monetary policy signals. At the same time, the reduction in minimum reserve requirement ratios  to gradually bring them into line with European levels  is likely to provide incentives for sustainable bank lending to the Romanian economy. This will proceed at a moderate pace, after having assessed the impact of previous measures. In today's meeting, the NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which reiterates the outlook for a sharp, albeit temporary, decline in the annual inflation rate in the first half of 2014, amid the protracted transitory impact of the plentiful harvest in 2013 and the lower VAT rate for some bakery products. Subsequently, the annual inflation rate is expected to return inside the variation band of the flat 2.5 percent target, on the back of the statistical base effect, and then to remain in the upper half of this band, largely due to administered price adjustments and the gradual narrowing of the negative output gap as economic activity picks up. Risks associated with the new projection relate to capital flow volatility amid the variability of investors' risk appetite and the changes in exposure to the emerging economies, given the decisions taken by major central banks across the world and the ongoing cross-border deleveraging in the banking system. On the domestic front, relevant risks are triggered by the dynamics of implementing structural reforms in the context of the upcoming elections. Against this backdrop, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 3.50 percent per annum from 3.75 percent previously. Hence, starting with 5 February 2014, the interest rate on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard) will be lowered to an annual 6.50 percent from 6.75 percent, while its deposit facility rate will stand at 0.50 percent per annum. The NBR Board has also decided to continue to pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The gradual tailoring of broad monetary conditions aims to safeguard price stability over the medium term in line with the 2.5 percent flat annual target. This conduct paves the way for a sound recovery of lending to the private sector, as the effect of the previous monetary policy adjustments (concerning policy rate and minimum reserve requirements) has yet to be fully incorporated. Moreover, the consistent implementation of an adequate macroeconomic policy mix, in line with the precautionary external financing arrangement signed with the international financial institutions, along with balanced social and political developments during the electoral year 2014, is key to consolidating the stability and the growth prospects of the domestic economy, thereby enhancing its resilience to external shocks. The NBR reiterates that it will closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, via the calibration of the monetary policy conduct and the adequate use of its available tools, to ensure price stability over the medium term and financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference on 6 February 2014, when the new calendar on NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues for the next 12 months is announced.

Philippines,2014-02-05,"Statement by BSP Governor Amando M Tetangco. At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy rates at3.50 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 5.50 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were left unchanged as well. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment of manageable inflation. While inflation has risen slightly due mainly to the recent increase in food prices on account of adverse weather conditions, latest baseline forecasts continue to indicate that the future inflation path is likely to stay within the target ranges of 4±1 percent for 2014 and 3±1 percent for 2015. Meanwhile, market expectations remain anchored to the inflation target over the policy horizon. The Monetary Board noted that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook remains slightly weighted toward the upside given the pending petitions for adjustments in utility rates and the possible uptick in food prices. The Board also noted that while the global economy has become more challenging because of heightened financial market uncertainty following monetary policy adjustments in the US and generalized concerns about the sustainability of growth in emerging economies, domestic economic activity is likely to stay firm. Sound fundamentals such as buoyant demand, strong fiscal and external positions as well as favorable consumer and business sentiment would support the economy. The Monetary Board will continue to closely monitor and assess evolving growth and liquidity conditions and will consider policy adjustments, when needed, to ensure continued price and financial stability."
Poland,2014-02-05,"Warsaw, 5 February 2014 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 4-5 February 2014 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 2.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 4.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis;  bill rediscount rate at 2.75% on an annual basis. Growth in global economic activity remains moderate, although the situation varies across countries. In the United States, economic conditions have improved, which has prompted the Federal Reserve to reduce the scale of quantitative easing. At the same time, the euro area has been experiencing a slow, yet somewhat limited recovery. Against this background, the European Central Bank continues its highly accommodative monetary policy. In turn, activity growth in the largest emerging economies  despite some improvement  continues to be weak in comparison with their previous performance. Moderate growth in global economic activity is conducive to maintaining low inflation in many countries. The reduction of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve has had an adverse effect on the sentiment in the international financial markets, in particular with regard to some emerging market economies. Data on domestic economic activity indicate a continuation of the gradual recovery in Poland. Preliminary 2013 GDP figures show that economic growth in 2013 Q4 exceeded that seen in 2013 Q3, with net exports still contributing substantially to GDP growth. The gradual economic revival is also confirmed by data on industrial output and retail sales, and levelling off the decline in construction and assembly output. Activity growth in the subsequent quarters is signalled by business climate indicators. The gradual recovery is contributing to an improvement in labour market conditions. Signs of employment growth have been observed, which should be conducive to a decrease in unemployment. Yet, unemployment persists at elevated levels, which is hampering wage pressure in the economy. CPI inflation amounted to 0.7% in December 2013, thus remaining markedly below the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. Also core inflation measures remained low, which confirms that demand pressure continues to be weak. In turn, weak cost pressure in the economy is manifested in a further decline in producer prices. This is accompanied by low inflation expectations. 1/2 In the recent period, lending to the private sector has accelerated slightly while remaining limited. In December 2013, the annual growth in lending to enterprises and households was still low. At the same time, since mid-2013, there has been a gradual acceleration in consumer loans. In the opinion of the Council, gradual economic recovery is likely to continue in the coming quarters, however, inflationary pressures will remain subdued. Therefore, the Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council maintains its assessment that NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged at least until the end of the first half of 2014. In the opinion of the Council, lowering interest rates in the first half of 2013 and keeping them unchanged in subsequent quarters supports recovery of the domestic economy, gradual return of inflation to the target and stabilisation in the financial markets."
Czech Republic,2014-02-06,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged, i.e. at technical zero. The Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. The nature of this exchange rate commitment is unchanged.. This decision is underpinned by a new forecast, which is based on an assumption of stable market interest rates at their current very low level and a flat exchange rate of the koruna close to CZK 27 to the euro until the start of next year. The message of the forecast confirms that the decision made in November to start using the exchange rate as an additional monetary policy instrument significantly contributed to averting the threat of deflation. The weakening of the koruna will accelerate the return of inflation to the target, which according to the forecast will occur in late 2014, and support the recovery in the economy and the labour market. The Bank Board considers the risks to the new forecast to be balanced. The Bank Board continues to view the level of the exchange rate commitment as appropriate, as it delivers the necessary easing of the monetary conditions. The Bank Board foresees this exchange rate commitment being maintained at least until the start of 2015. Turning to the assumptions of the forecast regarding developments abroad, economic growth in the euro area will accelerate this year and the next. Producer prices in the euro area are falling year on year, and in some countries the same goes for consumer prices. The forecast assumes that price growth will resume gradually in the euro area, but with less intensity than in the previous forecast. A low outlook for foreign interest rates reflects expectations of accommodative European Central Bank monetary policy in the face of subdued price developments. Compared to the previous forecast, the interest rate outlook has shifted to lower levels, especially in 2015. Overall, the outlook for the euro area has therefore shifted towards weaker inflationary impulses and easier monetary policy, the only exception being slightly higher assumed economic growth in the euro area in 2015. The outlook for the dollar price of Brent crude oil continues to assume a slight decline. At the same time, the euro is expected to weaken gradually against the dollar. The general modest decline in commodity and energy prices combined with the evolution of the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar does not imply significant cost-push inflation pressures. As regards developments in the Czech economy, the forecast expects a sizeable decrease in headline inflation to low positive levels at the start of this year. This will be partly due to still subdued domestic economic activity and slow wage growth, coupled with a fall in administered prices and an unwinding of the effects of the VAT changes made last year. Inflation will then pick up pace, returning towards the Czech National Bank's target of 2% at the end of this year. This will initially reflect rising import prices connected with the weakening of the koruna. Starting in the second half of this year, consumer price inflation will also be strongly affected by an economic recovery and faster wage growth. Inflation will increase further at the start of next year amid renewed growth in administered prices. It will reach the upper half of the tolerance band at the monetary policy horizon and then return from above to the 2% target, where it should stabilise. On average we expect inflation to reach 1.2% this year and 1.9% overall for this year and the next. This is 0.1 percentage point lower than in the previous forecast in both cases. Even after the November weakening of the koruna, we continue to expect the second-lowest average price growth in ten years in 2014. Unlike in previous years, this year's inflation will not be significantly affected by tax changes. The forecast assumes only a further harmonisation increase in excise duty on cigarettes. Monetary-policy relevant inflation, i.e. inflation adjusted for the direct effects of changes to indirect taxes, will thus move in parallel with headline inflation, only at a slightly lower level. Following a decline in the previous two years, the economy will grow by more than 2% this year according to the forecast. The domestic economy will be supported by growth in external demand and the monetary policy easing executed via the weakening of the koruna. The weaker currency will boost the price competitiveness of domestic production and, via a decrease in real interest rates, support private consumption and investment expenditure. Unlike in previous years, fiscal policy will have a broadly neutral effect on economic growth. Next year the growth rate of the domestic economy will rise to 2.8%. In 2015 the economy will thus grow 0.3 percentage point faster than we previously expected. The recovery of the domestic economy will be reflected on the labour market in 2014 initially in lower use of forced part-time work and in 2015 also in a drop in the unemployment rate. Wage growth in the business sector will increase from the current record lows. The forecast expects market interest rates to be flat at their current very low level until the start of next year. According to the forecast, the easier monetary conditions will lead to an economic recovery and wage growth sufficient to allow monetary policy potentially to return to the conventional regime, in which interest rates will again play the main role, at the start of next year."
Euroarea,2014-02-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Incoming information confirms that the moderate recovery of the euro area economy is proceeding in line with our previous assessment. At the same time, underlying price pressures in the euro area remain weak and monetary and credit dynamics are subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. As stated previously, we are now experiencing a prolonged period of low inflation, which will be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. Regarding the medium-term outlook for prices and growth, further information and analysis will become available in early March. Recent evidence fully confirms our decision to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy for as long as necessary, which will assist the gradual economic recovery in the euro area. We continue to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation is based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. With regard to recent money market volatility and its potential impact on our monetary policy stance, we are monitoring developments closely and are ready to consider all available instruments. Overall, we remain firmly determined to maintain the high degree of monetary accommodation and to take further decisive action if required. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following two quarters of positive real GDP growth, developments in recent data and surveys overall suggest that the moderate recovery continued in the last quarter of 2013. Looking ahead, our previous assessment of economic growth has been confirmed. Output in the euro area is expected to recover at a slow pace. In particular, some improvement in domestic demand should materialise, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance, improving financing conditions and the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. In addition, real incomes are supported by lower energy price inflation. Economic activity is also expected to benefit from a gradual strengthening of demand for euro area exports. At the same time, although unemployment in the euro area is stabilising, it remains high, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and the private sector will continue to weigh on the pace of the economic recovery. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. Developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties, notably in emerging market economies, may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. Other downside risks include weaker than expected domestic demand and export growth and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.7% in January 2014, after 0.8% in December. At the same time, the inflation rate in January 2014 was lower than generally expected On the basis of current information and prevailing futures prices for energy, annual HICP inflation rates are expected to remain at around current levels in the coming months. Over the medium term, underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Both upside and downside risks to the outlook for price developments remain limited, and they continue to be broadly balanced over the medium term. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for December 2013 confirm the assessment of subdued underlying growth in broad money (M3) and credit. Annual growth in M3 moderated to 1.0% in December, from 1.5% in November. Deposit outflows in December mirrored the strong sales of government and private sector securities by euro area MFIs, which, in part, could be related to adjustments by banks in anticipation of the ECB's comprehensive assessment of banks' balance sheets. These developments also affected annual growth in M1, which moderated to 5.8% in December but remained strong. As in previous months, the main factor supporting annual M3 growth was an increase in the MFI net external asset position, which continued to reflect the increased interest of international investors in euro area assets. The annual rate of change of loans to the private sector continued to contract. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.3% in December, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.9% in December, after -3.1% in November. The January 2014 bank lending survey provides indications of some further stabilisation in credit conditions for firms and households and a smaller net decline in loan demand by enterprises. Overall, weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. Since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks. In order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. This is the objective of the ECB's comprehensive assessment, while the timely implementation of additional steps to establish a banking union will further help to restore confidence in the financial system. To sum up, the economic analysis confirms our expectation of a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms the picture of subdued underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term. As regards fiscal policies, euro area countries should not unravel past consolidation efforts and should put high government debt on a downward trajectory over the medium term. Fiscal strategies should be in line with the Stability and Growth Pact and should ensure a growth-friendly composition of consolidation which combines improving the quality and efficiency of public services with minimising distortionary effects of taxation. When accompanied by the decisive implementation of structural reforms, these strategies will further support the still fragile economic recovery. Governments must therefore continue with product and labour market reforms. These reforms will help to enhance the euro area's growth potential and reduce the high unemployment rates in many countries."
Georgia,2014-02-12,"12.02.14 NBG Increases Its Policy Rate by 25 basis points to 4% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on February 12, 2014 and decided to increase the refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4%. According to current forecasts, inflation will reach its target value in the second half of 2014. Overall annual CPI inflation in January was 2.9%, whereas monthly inflation was 0.8%. The end of 2013 saw an increase in economic activity. According to preliminary estimates, economic growth in November-December exceeded 8%, which means that the estimated growth rate of the fourth quarter is 6.9% and the total GDP growth in 2013 is 3.1%. The economic growth in the fourth quarter was caused by both foreign demand (which was active in previous periods as well) and an increase in domestic demand. The latter was also manifested in the high annual growth rate of imports, in particular the import of investment goods, which should stimulate the revival of economic growth in the future. Bank credit activity grew in the second half of 2013, particularly in the last months of the year. Excluding the exchange rate effect, the banks' loan portfolio grew by 16% in 2013. Since August 2013 the nominal effective exchange rate has depreciated by 2.8%. According to the NBG's estimates, the effect of this depreciation on consumer prices is about 1 percentage point, which has already been accounted for in the current inflation forecast. Economic growth has been recovering in recent periods and this trend is expected to continue in the first half of 2014. Preliminary indicators, as measured in January, also point towards the retention of this trend. Based on the aforementioned points, the Monetary Policy Committee decided that there is no further need to retain an accommodative monetary policy and elected to increase the policy rate by 25 basis points. The National Bank has thus started to withdraw the accommodative monetary policy, provided that the aforementioned trends are maintained in future periods. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will tighten the monetary policy if the inflation forecast exceeds its target value. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on March 26, 2014."
Mongolia,2014-02-12,"THE BANK OF MONGOLIA MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Monetary policy decision Number: 2014/01 Effective date: 12 February 2014 At its meetings on the 7th through 11th of February 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) made following decisions in accordance with maintaining macroeconomic stability and ensuring financial stability: • To keep policy interest rate unchanged at 10.5 percent, • To exempt banks' long-term (3 years or more) foreign exchange denominated bonds and external loans, which are issued in or borrowed from international market, from the BOM's reserve requirement. Inflation excluding administered prices has been close to the targeted level of inflation even though external economic condition has been unfavorable and pressure on the balance of payments has been high. The MPC has emphasized the importance of enhancing efficiencies of the BOM-Government medium-term joint programs whilst continuously implementing those Pro growth programs aimed at stabilizing the overall economy and supporting sustainable economic growth. However, decline in foreign direct investments and from-year-to-year delays on the implementation of major projects, which will have significant impacts on the economy, have been weakening economic resilience and becoming a main challenge for macroeconomic policy. In addition, quasi-fiscal expenditure since 2013 and its further uncertainties have been dampening and diluting the effects of monetary policy implementation. Concise minutes of the MPC meeting will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
South Korea,2014-02-13,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to have continued to ease, while economic growth trends in some emerging market countries have shown signs of weakening to some extent. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the US Federal Reserve's QE tapering and by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries. In Korea, some indicators related to domestic demand have slumped temporarily, but as exports continue their favorable movements the Committee appraises the economic recovery to have continued in line with the trend of growth. On the employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded substantially, in line with increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for the time being going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will gradually narrow. Consumer price inflation registered 1.1% in January, the same as in December, as the effects of the slowing in the downward trend of petroleum product prices and of the expansion in the extent of decline of agricultural product prices offset each other. Core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products fell slightly, from 1.9% the month previous to 1.7%, due mainly to the slowing of the uptrends in prices of industrial products other than petroleum. The Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, although it will remain low for the time being due largely to the stability of international commodity prices. Regarding the housing market, sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas maintained their level of the previous month while the uptrend of those in the rest of the country slowed. As for leasehold-deposit prices, their extents of increase contracted slightly both in Seoul and its surrounding areas and in the rest of the country. In the domestic financial markets, stock prices had fallen and the Korean won depreciated, influenced mainly by international financial market instability and by outflows of foreigners' stock investment funds. Recently, however, stock prices have rebounded and the Korean won has appreciated. Long-term market interest rates have meanwhile fluctuated within a relatively narrow range. Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and the influences of external risk factors such as shifts in major countries' monetary policies and market unrest in some emerging economies, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while supporting the continued recovery of economic growth."
Russia,2014-02-14,"On 14 February 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to maintainthe Bank of Russia key rate at 5.50 percent per annum. The decision was based on the analysis of the current trends and macroeconomic projections, that, given unchanged monetary policy stance, by the end of 2014 inflation is expected to be close to the target level amid slow economic growth. The world economy continues to recover slowly but there are diverse trends observed in different regions. Weak economic growth in the countries that are Russia's trading partners curbs demand for Russian exports and restrains the national economy. At the same time, oil prices remain at consistently high levels. Russian economy's growth rates remain low while industrial output continues to stagnate. Meanwhile, business confidence indices show the lack of improvement in producers' sentiments. Weak investment activity is caused by the overall economic uncertainty and lower profits in the real sector. Fueled by growth in retail lending and high growth of real wages, consumer demand is still a major driver of economic growth. The aggregate output of goods and services remains somewhat below potential. Demand for bank loans has not demonstrated any growth amid the slack in economic activity. This led to a moderate decrease in interest rates on bank loans and on household deposits. Lending to non-financial organizations showed stable dynamics despite a persistent tightening of requirements for a borrower's financial standing and a loan collateral quality. Household loan growth continued to slow down, though stayed rather high. The Bank of Russia assesses that the current lending dynamics does not restrain economic growth. In December 2013, the annual growth rate of consumer prices reached 6.5%, surpassing the target range for the specified period. Acceleration of inflation in 2013 Q4 was largely attributed to rise in prices of fruits and vegetables, along with some milk and poultry products. The Bank of Russia estimates the contribution of this factor to the inflation acceleration in 2013 at 0.5 percentage point. In early 2014, the annual growth of consumer prices decelerated and stood at 6.1% as of 10 February 2014. The slowdown in inflation occured due to the decline in the growth rate of food prices. Core inflation remained stable in the second half of 2013 and in early 2014. Factors that led to acceleration of inflation at the end of 2013 are expected to exhaust their influence in the first half of 2014. Amid slow recovery of external demand and weak investment activity, the aggregate output of goods and services will remain below potential. This factor will contribute to a decrease in the consumer price growth rate. Slow growth rates in monetary aggregates formed in 2012 and persisted in 2013 will also contain inflation in 2014. Based on the above specified trends and given the current key rate level, the Bank of Russia expects the downward trend in consumer price growth to continue with inflation rate converging to the target level of 5.0% in late 2014. Major sources of uncertainty for this forecast are inflationary risks related to accelerated price growth at the end of 2013 and observed currency depreciation. If the negative impact of these factors spills over to the prices of a wide range of goods and services and to the household expectations, the probability of inflation deviating from the mid-term targets will increase. In this case, the Bank of Russia will be ready to tighten its monetary policy. The next Bank of Russia Board of Directors meeting is to be held on March 14, 2014. The information notice on the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. Interest rates on Bank of Russia major operations1(% p.a.).

Peru,2014-02-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2014 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.0 percent. This level of the reference rate is compatible with an inflation forecast of 2 percent in the 2014-2015 forecast horizon and takes into account that: inflation expectations remain anchored within the inflation target range; GDP has been recording lower growth rates than the country's potential level of growth; recent indicators show some recovery in the world economy, and the supply factors that affected inflation would become more moderate. Inflation in January registered a rate of 0.32 percent and thus inflation in the last 12 months rose from 2.86 percent in December to 3.07 percent in January, which reflected the rise in the prices of some food products due to transitory supply factors. This explains that the rate of inflation without food and energy was 0.03 percent (2.95 percent in the last 12 months). Inflation is forecast to remain initially close to the upper band of the target range due to the lagging effect of the supply shocks and to converge thereafter to the 2 percent target. Economic activity slowed down until the third quarter of 2013 as a result of the lower growth of our exports associated with the deceleration of economic activity in our main trading partners and with lower export prices. Indicators of activity and the surveys on macroeconomic expectations show a recovery of economic activity in the first quarter of this year. The rate of maximum mean reserve requirements and marginal reserve requirements in domestic currency was lowered from 14 to 13 percent in February with the purpose of supporting the dynamism of credit in soles. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants and, if necessary, will implement additional measures to ease its monetary policy instruments. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to reduce the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.20 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for March on its meeting of March 13, 2014."
Chile,2014-02-18,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 18 February 2014 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 4.25% (annual). In the global economy, a recovery in our trade partners' growth is expected in the coming quarters, grounded in the rebound of developed economies, especially the United States. Inflation in these economies has remained subdued, so a slow normalization of their monetary policy is foreseen. On the other hand, volatility in emerging markets has increased, as seen in movements of the stock market, risk premia, and the depreciation of their currencies. During the last month, the oil price increased, while that of copper decreased slightly. The Chilean economy has continued to lose strength. Domestic output and demand have grown less than assumed in the Monetary Policy Report, particularly in investment-related sectors. Current and expected inflation are in line with the inflation target. The peso has depreciated, while the pace of nominal wages' growth shows some moderation in recent months. The Board estimates that in the coming months it might be necessary to increase the monetary stimulus to ensure that projected inflation will stand at 3% in the policy horizon. In any case, any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Hungary,2014-02-18,"At its meeting on 18 February, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 15 basis points from 2.85% to 2.7%, with effect from 19 February 2014. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue this year and next. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening, output remains below its potential and is likely to come close to that level again at the end of the horizon relevant for monetary policy. With employment rising, the unemployment rate is falling, but still exceeds its long-term level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain subdued over the medium term. Global investor sentiment has been volatile recently, and perceptions of the risks associated with Hungary and other economies of the region have deteriorated. Inflation continued to fall in January, mainly as a result of the moderation in fuel prices. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation capturing the medium-term outlook rose relative to the previous month but continued to indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy, which reflects the effects of weak domestic demand and low inflation in external markets. The persistently low inflation environment may provide a firmer anchor for inflation expectations. The rate of private sector wage growth has picked up somewhat recently but still remains moderate. Domestic real economic factors are expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact, although to a declining extent, as activity rises further. Incoming data showed that economic growth continued in the fourth quarter of 2013. According to the preliminary release. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 was stronger than market expectations. Growth is expected to pick up further in the quarters ahead and to return to a more balanced pattern. With the increase in corporate investment due to the Funding for Growth Scheme and the Government's infrastructure projects using EU funding, the recovery in household consumption is likely to be gradual. Growth in real income is expected to be partly offset by the ongoing reduction in debt accumulated during the years prior to the crisis and the slow easing in tight credit conditions. Global investor sentiment has been volatile recently as a result of the Fed's decision to reduce further the pace of its asset purchases and the deterioration in perceptions of the risks associated with emerging economies. A number of emerging market currencies came under heavy selling pressure. Looking forward, however, the euro-area policy rate is expected to remain at low levels for an extended period. Perceptions of the risks associated with Hungary and other economies of the region deteriorated, as reflected in rises in CDS spreads and bond yields and higher volatility of the forint exchange rate. In the Council's judgement, a cautious approach to policy is warranted due to uncertainty related to the global financial environment. Nevertheless. Hungary's position is fundamentally strong compared to other emerging market economies. The country's persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are reducing its vulnerability. The current account has moved into surplus, reflecting the significant adjustment by the government and private sectors, thereby reducing the country's external debt and the economy's reliance on external financing. In the Council's judgement, there remains a significant degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Delivering price stability in the medium term points in the direction of monetary easing. Conditions in global financial markets have been volatile recently. In the Council's judgement, there remained scope for reducing interest rates in the context of increased uncertainty in financial markets. The room for manoeuvre in monetary policy - taking into account financial stability considerations - continues to be influenced by the medium-term achievement of the inflation target, a corresponding degree of support to the economy and a sustained and marked shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy. The Monetary Council will decide on the need and possibility for continuing the easing cycle after a comprehensive assessment of the macroeconomic outlook and developments in perceptions of the risks about the economy in view of the baseline projection and alternative scenarios of the March forecast."
Turkiye,2014-02-18,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 12 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 11.5 percent, and borrowing rate at 8 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 10 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 15 percent. The Committee closely monitors recent deterioration in the inflation outlook and expectations. Inflation is likely to hover above the 5 percent target for some time due to recent tax adjustments, exchange rate developments, and elevated food prices. In order to contain the deterioration in inflation expectations and pricing behavior, the Committee implemented a strong and frontloaded monetary tightening at the interim meeting of January 28, 2014. Tight monetary policy stance will be maintained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. There is a gradual slowdown in loan growth stemming from the tight monetary policy stance, the recent macroprudential measures, and weak capital flows. The data regarding the first quarter of 2014 indicate some deceleration in private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, with the help of the recovery in foreign demand, contribution of net exports to economic growth is expected to increase. Accordingly, the Committee expects a significant improvement in the current account deficit in 2014. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2014-02-24,"The CPI for the month of January surprised to the downside, and theinflation rate over the preceding 12 months is 1.4 percent: in the lower portion of the target range. After the CPI reading was published, private forecasters reduced their projections for the next 12 CPI readings, and inflation expectations for one year ahead, from various sources, are all below the midpoint of the inflation target. According to the initial estimate for the fourth quarter of 2013. GDP increased by 2.3 percent and business sector product increased by only 1.6 percent. The positive turnaround in export data is based mainly on pharmaceuticals exports which are generally volatile, and exports by labor-intensiveindustries are still in a virtual standstill. Various indicators of activity in January pointed to some recovery, but consumer confidence indices continued to signal pessimism, and data continued to indicate a lack of growthin employment and wages in the business sector. In the past month, the shekel depreciated by 1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate; since the beginning of 2013, there has been a cumulative appreciation of 7.3 percent. After two quarters of rapid growth, recent US economic data were disappointing, though it is too early to determine if it is a temporary slowdown or a turning point downward. In Europe, slow growth continues, and there are growing concerns of deflation. The Federal Reserve's tapering process in its asset purchase program is expected to continue, and the accommodative monetary policy in other major economies is expected to continue foran extended period of time. Home prices increased by 8.1 percent in the past year, and the increasein the number of transactions and the high volume of mortgages being granted continue. There is a continued trend of improvement in the risk characteristics of new mortgages. To view this Press Release as a Word document. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined by 0.6 percent in January, more than forecasters' projections, which were for a decline of 0.2 percent, on average. The surprise to the downside derived mainly from two components: food, which declined by 0.8 percent,and owned dwellings services, which declined by 0.9 percent. The fruit andvegetables component increased by 0.9 percent. The rate of inflation over the preceding 12 months was 1.4 percent, compared with 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in December. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Private forecasters' inflation projections for the next 12 CPI readings declined slightlyafter publication of the CPI reading for January, and average 1.6 percent.Inflation expectations derived from the capital market remain at 1.9 percent, and expectations for the next 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates remained at 1.4 percent. Inflation expectationsfor medium and long terms did not change markedly this month, and remain slightly above the midpoint of the inflation target range. Private forecasters' projections, as well as data derived from the Telbor interest rates and the makam curve, indicate some probability of one reductionin the Bank of Israel interest rate in the coming three months. Over a range of one year, the probability of a reduction in the interest rate is lower, and some forecasters even expect one increase in the interest rate over that time. Real economic activity: Data that became available this month continue to indicate that the economy is growing at a moderate pace. According to the initial estimate of National Accounts data for the fourth quarterof 2013 (seasonally adjusted, annual terms). GDP increased by 2.3 percent and business sector product increased by 1.6 percent. With that, there was relatively high growth in the various uses, based in part on a marked decline in inventories and an increase in imports: private consumption increased by 3 percent, public consumption grew 3.1 percent, and investment in industries increased by 4.5 percent. Exports (excluding diamonds and start-up companies) increased by 61 percent, an outlier figure deriving mainly from volatile pharmaceuticals exports. Foreign trade data indicate that goods exports renewed their increase in January, after a temporary decline in December, primarily in high technology and medium-high technology industries, while there was a continued standstill in exports of low technology industries. The increase in goods imports continued, primarily in raw materialsand investment goods, which are likely to support an increase in the economy's production capacity in the future. In December, there was alsoa recovery in business services exports (excluding start-up companies, seasonally adjusted). The Composite State of the Economy Index increased in January by 0.3 percent, the result of an increase in import, export, and industrial production data, even with a decline in the trade and services revenue indices. The Climate Index, based on the Business Tendency Survey of theCentral Bureau of Statistics, increased by 0.26 percent in February, and indicates the possibility of some recovery in business sector activity. The Purchasing Managers Index for February also indicates improvement. There were no major changes in the consumer confidence indices compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics and by Bank Hapoalim, and they continue to indicate pessimism among consumers. The labor market: Labor Force Survey data for December indicatea decline of 0.6 percentage points in the employment rate among the principal working ages, after 3 months of increases, and a slight increase in theunemployment rate among this group, from 5 percent to 5.2 percent. The overall unemployment rate increased, from 5.6 percent to 5.8 percent. Most of the moderate increase in the number of employee posts in the business sector over the past two years derived from an increase in employee posts held by non-Israeli workers, while the number of employee posts of Israelis did not increase over that time. Employee posts in the public services industries increased by 0.5 percent in September-November, compared with theprevious 3-month period, and this was reflected primarily in nonprofit organizations and companies in the public service industries, and less so in the general government. Nominal wages increased by 0.1 percent, and real wages declined by 0.4 percent, in September-November, compared with June-August. Net of non-Israeli workers, nominal wages increased by 0.5 percent, and real wages were unchanged. Health tax receipts by the National Insurance Institute, which provide an indication of total wage paymentsin the economy, were 3.9 percent higher in December-January, on a nominal basis, than in the corresponding two months of the previous year, compared with a 6.1 percent year over year increase in October-November. The number of job vacancies increased to about 60,000 in January, after declining from 65,000 to 56,000 from the middle through the end of 2013. An expectation for a moderate increase in employment is also indicated in the Employers Survey by the Ministry of the Economy. Budget data: In January, the government's domestic surplus excluding credit was NIS 4.3 billion, similar to the average January surplus in the preceding 4 years, and slightly below the seasonal path consistent with the deficit ceiling for 2014. Domestic revenues were NIS 25 billion in January, about NIS 1.2 billion more than the seasonal path consistentwith the tax revenues projected in the budget, resulting from one-time revenues. Domestic expenditure was about NIS 20.7 billion, about NIS 1.7 billion more than the seasonal path. Gross domestic VAT receipts increased by about 12 percent in real terms compared with January 2013, and excluding legislative changes the increase was about 5.2 percent. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on January 26, 2014, through February 21, 2014, the shekel weakened by 0.8 percent against the dollar and by about 0.9 percent against the euro, while the dollar and euro weakened against most major currencies worldwide. The shekel weakened by about 1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on January 26, 2014, through February 21, 2014, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by 1.6 percent, a lower return than the trend in advanced economies. There were slight declines in government bond yields, on the unindexed and CPI-indexed curve, similar to the global trend. The yield to maturity ona 10-year unindexed bond declined was unchanged at 3.6 percent. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and 10-year US Treasury securities declined slightly, to 83 basis points. Makam yields moved slightly along the entire curve, and the 1-year yield is 0.9 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread was virtually unchanged during the period, and is around 95 basis points. The Tel-Bond 60 Index increased by 0.3 percent. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in January, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 15.9 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 6.6 percent. Developments in the credit markets: Total outstanding debt of the business sector declined by about NIS 3.9 billion (0.5 percent) in December, to NIS 779 billion, resulting from a reduction in outstanding bonds and credit from abroad, which was offset by an increase in bank credit and infunds raised directly through loans from institutional investors. In January, the private nonfinancial sector issued about NIS 2.4 billion in bonds, slightly below the monthly average for 2013. Most of the issues in January were in the banking industry. Corporate bond spreads increased slightly from the middle of January, though they remain low from an historical perspective. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 2.3 billion (0.6 percent), to about NIS 410 billion at month end, with an increase in the balance of housing and non-housing credit. In January, new mortgages taken out totaled NIS 3.8 billion. The trend of decline continues in new mortgages' risk characteristics: the loan to value ratio, the payment to income ratio, and the share of mortgages granted at variable rate interest. The average interest rate on new mortgages taken out inJanuary declined on all indexation tracks, by 0.05-0.1 percentage points, continuing the decline in December. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) declined by 0.6 percent in January. In the 12 months ending in January, this component increased by 2.4 percent, compared with an increase of 2.9 percent in the 12 months ended in December. Home prices, which are measured in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased sharply by 1.5 percent in November-December. Over the 12 months ending in December, prices increased by 8.1 percent, compared with an increase of 7.9 percent in the 12 months ended inNovember. In December, the number of transactions reached its highest level since 1997, and the share of investors in transactions stabilized at around 22 percent. With that, the Consumer Confidence Index published by the Central Bureau of Statistics indicates that there has been a decline in the intent to purchase a home, and there is a moderation in the decline in the stock of unsold homes. In the 12 months ending in November, there was a highlevel of about 43,800 building starts and about 42,200 building completions, and in light of the steps being taken by the government, it may be assessed that the increase in the stock of homes will continue. The global economy: The global economic picture developing thismonth is not significantly different from the picture last month. Data on activity were relatively weak in most advanced economies: in the US,employment figures, industrial production, the Purchasing Managers Index, and retail sales figures were notably poor, after two quarters of relatively strong growth. With that, it is likely that the data were negatively affected by the weather, and it is still not clear if this was a turning point downward. The Federal Reserve announced, as expected, continued tapering ofits asset purchase program, and in her first speech to Congress, the Federal Reserve Chair expressed optimism about the economy's recovery, though she noted that the labor market is still far from a complete recovery, and that additional reductions in asset purchases will be carried out at a measured pace. In the Eurozone, the first estimate for the fourth quarterof 2013 indicated growth of 0.3 percent compared with the third quarter. Indices of expectations published this month, such as the Purchasing Managers Index, as well as indices of activity, such as industrial production and retail sales, were disappointing. Credit to the business sector also continues to contract. The ECB kept the interest rate unchanged, though it hintedat the possibility that further accommodative steps would be taken in the future. In the UK, the Bank of England revised its 2014 growth forecast upward, but there, too, the interest rate is expected to remain low for an extended period of time. In Japan, as well, data on activity were disappointing, while indices of expectations were relatively optimistic. Volatility continued on global capital and foreign exchange markets this month, and this was reflected in declines of more than 10 percent in equity indices of emerging markets, and sharp depreciations in some of those countries. In India,Turkey, and South Africa, these trends led to central banks increasing theinterest rate. In China, production data were disappointing, and the purchasing managers index declined. Foreign trade data surprised to the upside, though concern remains that the sharp increase in credit may pose a threat to stability. Inflation in the US remains low, and in Europe there are growing concerns of deflation, while in Japan, inflation continues to pick up. This month, the price of a barrel of oil (Brent crude) increased by 2 percent. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to reduce the interest rate for March 2014 by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.75 percent, is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: The CPI for the month of January surprised to the downside, and theinflation rate over the preceding 12 months is 1.4 percent: in the lower portion of the target range. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for March 2014 will be published on March 10, 2014.

Egypt,2014-02-27,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release February 27, 2014 In its meeting held on February 27, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 825 percent, 925 percent, and 875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 875 percen. Headline CPI increased by 142 percent (m/m) in January compared to a decline of 102 percent (m/m) in Decembe. Despite of the monthly increase, the annual rate declined to 1136 percent in January from 1166 percent recorded in the previous month on the back of favorable base effects from last yea. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 111 percent (m/m) in January following an increase of 041 percent in Decembe. Similar to the headline, the annual core inflation rate declined to 1169 percent in January from 1191 in December on the back of favorable base effects from last yea. The latest monthly developments in both headline and core inflation were largely driven by higher prices of several food item. As upside risks to the inflation outlook continue to moderate as the possibility of a rebound in international food prices is unlikely in light of recent global developments, annual inflation is projected to ease from their current levels in the coming month. Meanwhile real GDP continued to lose some of its already weak momentum in 2013/2014 Q1, growing by 104 percent compared to the feeble growth rate of 21 percent recorded in 2012/201. Economic activity remained sluggish in 2013/2014 Q1 on the back of modest growth rates in most of the key sectors, namely manufacturing and construction in addition to the contraction in the tourism and petroleum sector. In the meantime, investment levels remained low given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants since early 2011 and the weak credit growth to the private secto. Looking ahead, downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. The pronounced downside risks to domestic GDP combined with the persistently negative output gap since 2011 will limit upside risks to the inflation outlook going forwar. Given the mixed balance of risks surrounding the inflation and the GDP outlooks at this juncture. MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat Sub Governor.

Poland,2014-03-05,"Warsaw, 5 March 2014 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 4-5 March 2014 The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 2.50% on an annual basis; lombard rate at 4.00% on an annual basis; deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis; bill rediscount rate at 2.75% on an annual basis. Growth in global economic activity remains moderate, although the economic situation varies across countries. In the United States, economic conditions remain favourable despite signs of some weakening observed in the recent period. At the same time, the euro area has been experiencing a slow, yet somewhat limited recovery. Activity growth in the largest emerging economies continues to be weak as compared with their previous performance. Some of these economies have seen deterioration in business indicators in the recent period. Moderate growth in global economic activity is conducive to maintaining low inflation in many countries. Data on domestic economic activity confirm a continuation of the gradual recovery in Poland. In 2013 Q4 economic growth was higher than in 2013 Q3. GDP growth was supported primarily by net exports. At the same time, domestic demand contribution to GDP growth increased. This was related to accelerating consumption and investment growth. The gradual recovery at the beginning of 2014 is indicated by a further growth in industrial output and retail sales in January 2014. At the same time, growth in construction output was negative. Yet, business climate indicators suggest that recovery will continue in the coming quarters. The gradual economic recovery is contributing to an improvement in labour market conditions. According to the LFS, in 2014 Q4 the number of persons working in the economy was higher than a year before. This helped to reduce somewhat the unemployment rate, which however remained elevated. Unemployment persisting at heightened levels is hampering wage pressure in the economy. According to preliminary data. CPI inflation stood at 0.7% in January 2014, thus remaining markedly below the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. This was accompanied by a decline in core inflation measures, which confirms that demand pressure continues to be 1/2 weak. In turn, weak cost pressure in the economy is manifested by a further drop in producer prices. This is accompanied by low inflation expectations. Lending to the private sector  while accelerating slightly  remains limited. In particular, since mid-2013 there has been a gradual acceleration in consumer loans. The past few months have seen a slight growth in housing and corporate loans from a low level. The Council got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute, being one of the inputs to the Council's decisions on NBP interest rates. In line with the March projection based on the NECMOD model  prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 14 February 2014 (projection cut-off date)  there is a 50-percent probability of inflation running in the range of 0.8-1.4% in 2014 (as compared to 1.1-2.2% in the November 2013 projection), 1.0-2.6% in 2015 (as against 1.1-2.6%) and 1.6-3.3% in 2016. At the same time, the annual GDP growth  in line with the March projection  will be, with a 50-percent probability in the range of 2.9-4.2% in 2014 (as compared to 2.0-3.9% in the November 2013 projection), 2.7-4.8% in 2015 (as against 2.1-4.5%) and 2.3-4.8% in 2016. In the opinion of the Council, gradual economic recovery is likely to continue in the coming quarters, however, inflationary pressures will remain subdued. Such assessment is confirmed by the March projection of inflation and GDP. Therefore, the Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged. In the Council's assessment NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged for a longer period of time, i.e. at least until the end of the third quarter of 2014. In the opinion of the Council, lowering interest rates in the first half of 2013 and keeping them unchanged in subsequent quarters, supports recovery of the domestic economy, gradual return of inflation to the target and stabilisation in the financial markets."
Euroarea,2014-03-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Incoming information confirms that the moderate recovery of the euro area economy is proceeding in line with our previous assessment. At the same time, the latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections, now covering the period up to the end of 2016, support earlier expectations of a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement in HICP inflation rates towards levels closer to 2%. In keeping with this picture, monetary and credit dynamics remain subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Regarding the medium-term outlook for prices and growth, the information and analysis now available fully confirm our decision to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance for as long as necessary. This will assist the gradual economic recovery in the euro area. We continue to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation is based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy, the high degree of unutilised capacity and subdued money and credit creation. We are monitoring developments on money markets closely and are ready to consider all instruments available to us. Overall, we remain firmly determined to maintain the high degree of monetary accommodation and to take further decisive action if required. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP in the euro area rose by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the last quarter of 2013, thereby increasing for three consecutive quarters. Developments in survey-based confidence indicators up to February are consistent with continued moderate growth also in the first quarter of this year. Looking ahead, the ongoing recovery is expected to proceed, albeit at a slow pace. In particular, some further improvement in domestic demand should materialise, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance, improving financing conditions and the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reform. In addition, real incomes are supported by lower energy prices. Economic activity is also expected to benefit from a gradual strengthening of demand for euro area exports. At the same time, although unemployment in the euro area is stabilising, it remains high, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on the pace of the economic recovery. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the March 2014 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.2% in 2014, 1.5% in 2015 and 1.8% in 2016. Compared with the December 2013 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for real GDP growth for 2014 has been revised slightly upwards. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. Developments in global financial markets and in emerging market economies, as well as geopolitical risks, may have the potential to affect economic conditions negatively. Other downside risks include weaker than expected domestic demand and export growth and insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.8% in February 2014, unchanged from the (upwardly revised) outcome for January. While energy prices fell more strongly in February than in the previous month, increases in industrial goods and services prices were higher than in January. On the basis of current information and prevailing futures prices for energy, annual HICP inflation rates are expected to remain at around current levels in the coming months. Thereafter, inflation rates should gradually increase and reach levels closer to 2%, in line with inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the March 2014 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.0% in 2014, 1.3% in 2015 and 1.5% in 2016. In the last quarter of 2016, annual HICP inflation is projected to be 1.7%. In comparison with the December 2013 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for inflation for 2014 has been revised slightly downwards. In view of the first publication of a three-year projection horizon in the March 2014 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, it should be stressed that the projections are conditional on a number of technical assumptions, including unchanged exchange rates and declining oil prices, and that the uncertainty surrounding the projections increases with the length of the projection horizon. Regarding the Governing Council's risk assessment, both upside and downside risks to the outlook for price developments are seen as limited and are considered to be broadly balanced over the medium term. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for January 2014 confirm the assessment of subdued underlying growth in broad money (M3) and credit. Annual growth in M3 increased to 1.2% in January, from 1.0% in December. The monthly inflow to M3 in January was substantial, compensating for the strong outflow in December. The increase in M3 growth reflected a stronger annual growth rate of M1, which rose to 6.2% from 5.7% in December. As in previous months, the main factor supporting annual M3 growth was an increase in the MFI net external asset position, which continued to reflect the increased interest of international investors in euro area assets. The annual rate of change of loans to the private sector continued to contract. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.9% in January, unchanged from December. Weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.2% in January 2014, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. Since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks. In order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. This is the objective of the ongoing comprehensive assessment by the ECB, while a timely implementation of additional steps to establish a banking union will further help to restore confidence in the financial system. To sum up, the economic analysis confirms our expectation of a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards levels of inflation closer to 2%. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms the picture of subdued underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term. As regards fiscal policies, the ECB staff macroeconomic projections indicate continued progress in reducing fiscal imbalances in the euro area. The aggregate euro area general government deficit is expected to have declined to 3.2% of GDP in 2013 and is projected to be reduced further to 2.7% of GDP this year. General government debt is projected to peak at 93.5% of GDP in 2014, before declining slightly in 2015. Looking ahead, euro area countries should not unravel past consolidation efforts and should put high government debt ratios on a downward trajectory over the medium term. Fiscal strategies should be in line with the Stability and Growth Pact and should ensure a growth-friendly composition of consolidation which combines improving the quality and efficiency of public services with minimising distortionary effects of taxation. National authorities should also continue with the decisive implementation of structural reforms in all euro area countries. These reforms should aim, in particular, to make it easier to do business and to boost employment, thus enhancing the euro area's growth potential and reducing unemployment in the euro area countries. To this end, the Governing Council welcomes the European Commission's communication of yesterday on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances and on the Excessive Deficit Procedure. Looking ahead, it is key that the macroeconomic surveillance framework in the euro area, which was significantly strengthened in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis, is implemented fully and in a consistent manner."
Malaysia,2014-03-06,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economic expansion remains moderate. While there have been improvements in the advanced economies, the recovery has been modest and uneven. In Asia, growth is supported by improvements in the external sector amid moderating domestic demand in some economies. Conditions in the international financial markets continue to be volatile as markets adjust to policy shifts in a number of major economies and to geopolitical developments. For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators point to further improvement in exports and continued expansion in private sector investment spending. Going forward, this trend is expected to continue. Exports will continue to benefit from the recovery in the advanced economies and from regional demand. Investment activity is projected to remain robust, led by capital spending by the private sector, particularly in the manufacturing and services sectors. Domestic demand is, however, expected to moderate, reflecting the ongoing public sector consolidation and as private consumption growth trends towards its long term average. Inflation has been gradually rising due to disruptions in supply following adverse weather conditions and increases in domestic costs. Going forward, inflation is expected to be affected by higher domestic costs. The subdued external price pressures and moderate domestic demand conditions will, to some extent, contain the impact of these cost factors on the underlying inflation. The MPC will continue to evaluate the global and domestic economic and financial developments and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy. At the same time, the MPC will also continue to monitor for signs of destabilising risks of financial imbalances. The MPC remains focused on ensuring that the monetary policy stance is consistent with price stability and continues to foster sustainable economic growth. Bank Negara Malaysia 06 March 2014."
Chile,2014-03-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 March 2014 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 4.0% (annual). Internationally, incoming information confirms the outlook of gradual recovery of the developed economies, while projections for emerging markets, particularly Latin America, have receded. Recent developments in China have had a negative impact on the prices of copper and other metals. Agricultural prices picked up since the last meeting, while fuels remained close to where they were a month ago. Inflation in the developed world has remained subdued, so a slow normalization of their monetary policies is foreseen. International financial conditions have remained stable. The Chilean economy has continued to lose strength. Domestic output and demand have grown less than assumed in the Monetary Policy Report, particularly in investment-related sectors. Annual inflation has increased, reflecting higher prices of foodstuffs and fuels, and the depreciation of the peso. In y-o-y terms, headline inflation and the core measure that excludes foodstuffs and energy stood at 3.2% and 2.5%, respectively. Inflation expectations are still around 3% in the relevant monetary policy horizon. The Board will consider the possibility of making additional cuts to the policy rate in line with the evolution of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions and its implications on the inflationary outlook. At the same time, the Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2014-03-13,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to have continued to ease, while economic growth trends in some emerging market countries have shown signs of weakening to some extent. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the US Federal Reserve's QE tapering and by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries. In Korea, the Committee appraises the economic recovery to have continued in line with the trend of growth, as exports continue their trend of increase amid the coexistence of improvements in and sluggishness of domestic-demand related indicators. On the employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded substantially, in line with increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for the time being going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will gradually narrow. Consumer price inflation fell slightly from 1.1% the previous month to 1.0% in February, due mainly to an increase in the extent of the decline in petroleum product prices, but core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products registered 1.7%, just as in January. The Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, although it will remain low for the time being due largely to a good agricultural crop harvest. Regarding the housing market, sales prices rose slightly in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and in the rest of the country, while leasehold- deposit prices in both regions continued to increase at paces similar to those during the month before. In the domestic financial markets, after having risen due mainly to international financial market stability stock prices have fallen back, primarily on increased concerns about economic slowdown in China. The Korean won has fluctuated within a narrow range, after having appreciated owing chiefly to the easing of financial unrest in emerging market countries. Long-term market interest rates have meanwhile moved within a relatively narrow range. Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and the influences of external risk factors such as shifts in major countries' monetary policies and geopolitical risk in Eastern Europe, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while supporting the continued recovery of economic growth."
Russia,2014-03-14,"On 14 March 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to maintainthe Bank of Russia key rate at 7.0 percent per annum. High inflation risks that brought about an increase in the key rate on 3 March 2014 still remain. Unstable external conditions and a rise in financial market volatility are conducive to an increase in economic uncertainty. Against this backdrop the Bank of Russia's priority is to contain the effect of exchange rate dynamics on inflation and to maintain financial stability. Hence, the Bank of Russia does not intend to lower the key rate in the coming months. The global economy continues to recover slowly. Persistently weak economic growth in most of Russia's trading partners curbs demand for exports from Russia and restrains the domestic economy. Meanwhile, oil prices remain at high levels. External inflation is stable and does not exert a noticeable influence on domestic prices. Russian economy continues to slow down. Industrial production is stagnating. Investment activity remains low amid economic uncertainty, declining profits in the real sector and tightened non-price lending conditions. Consumer demand is still the major driver of economic growth. It is supported by still high growth in retail lending. However, a decline in consumer activity is observed against the backdrop of a slower real wages growth and of a deteriorating consumer sentiment. The aggregate output of goods and services remains somewhat below potential. In February — early March 2014, the year-on-year growth rate of consumer prices rose and reached 6.4% as of 11 March 2014. Inflation acceleration was caused by the dynamics of prices for some food items, in particular, vegetables and fruit, along with dairy products. To some extent the rouble exchange rate dynamics has contributed to consumer price growth. In addition, core inflation did not decline in February 2014. The inflation rates are unlikely to fall until mid-2014 due to the observed rouble depreciation. Against this backdrop inflation expectations may increase, exerting upward pressure on consumer prices. On the other hand, the reduction in the growth rates of administered prices and tariffs along with the aggregate output of goods and services remaining somewhat below potential would contribute to inflation slowdown in the second half of 2014. The Bank of Russia estimates that the impact of observed rouble depreciation on economic growth will be limited. Amid increased uncertainty and declining producer and consumer confidence there is a strong probability of a reduction in fixed capital investment along with a further slowdown in consumption. As a result. Russian economic growth will be lower than expected. The noted factors will partially offset the exchange rate pass-through to inflation. Nevertheless, risks of above-target inflation in 2014 remain. Given the current monetary policy stance, the slowdown in consumer price growth will resume in the second half of 2014. In the medium term inflation will decelerate to the target levels. The next regular meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors, where the key rate level will be considered, is scheduled for 25 April 2014. The information notice on the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. Interest rates on the Bank of Russia major operations1(% p.a.).

Peru,2014-03-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2014 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.0 percent. This level of the reference rate is compatible with an inflation forecast of 2 percent in the 2014-2015 forecast horizon and takes into account that: inflation expectations remain anchored within the inflation target range; GDP has been recording lower growth rates than the country's potential level of growth; recent indicators show mixed signs of some recovery in the world economy, and the supply factors that affected inflation would become more moderate. Inflation in February registered a rate of 0.60 percent and thus inflation in the last 12 months rose from 3.07 percent in January to 3.78 percent in February, which reflected the rise in the electricity rates and prices of some food products due to transitory supply factors. This explains that the rate of inflation without food and energy was 0.19 percent (2.96 percent in the last 12 months). Inflation is forecast to remain initially close to the upper band of the target range due to the lagging effect of the supply shocks and to converge thereafter to the 2 percent target. Indicators of activity and the surveys on macroeconomic expectations show a recovery of economic activity in the first quarter of this year. The rate of reserve requirements in domestic currency was lowered from 13 to 12.5 percent in March with the purpose of supporting the dynamism of credit in soles. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants and, if necessary, will implement additional monetary policy measures. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to modify the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, in order to contribute to greater distribution of liquidity in the interbank market: Overnight deposits: 2.80 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for March on its meeting of April 10, 2014."
Pakistan,2014-03-15,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 15th March 2014 Almost all major economic indicators have moved in the desired direction over the past few months. Inflation has come down and growth in Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) has been strong. Similarly the fiscal deficit has been contained during the first half of the fiscal year while the private sector credit has increased. Moreover reflecting positive sentiments prevailing in the market, the fiscal authority has been able to borrow long term and rupee has appreciated against the US dollar. Above all, the foreign exchange reserves of SBP, key source of concern for some time, have increased noticeably. All-in-all confidence in the economy to rebound seems to have increased. This is visible in marked improvement in various IBA-SBP survey-based indices capturing consumers' confidence and perceptions of prevailing and expected economic conditions. Despite these positive developments in headline variables, however, the economy still faces many challenges and pro-active policy effort is required to continue to maintain the momentum. Increase in SBP's foreign exchange reserves from $3. billion at end-January 2014 to $4. billion by 7th March 2014 is only beginning. substantial and consistent accumulation of reserves is required to reach and maintain an adequate level. Similarly the net capital and financial flows, $428 million during July January. FY14, are still considerably lower than the external current account deficit of $2055 million during the same period. timely materialization of anticipated foreign inflows during Q4-FY14 is likely to improve the overall external position in the coming months. This expected outcome, however, is contingent upon host of policy actions including an appropriate monetary policy stance. Concerted structural reforms are required to address the deeper weaknesses in the balance of payments position. Reliance on one-off inflows and foreign loans may provide short-term stability, but share of private financial flows need to increase consistently to achieve long term stability. Similarly there is need to reduce trade deficit by improving efficiency and competitiveness of exports and to lower share of imported oil in meeting domestic energy needs. Nevertheless increase in SBP's foreign exchange reserves has improved market sentiments, dispirited speculators and resulted in an appreciation of rupee viz-a-viz US dollar by. percent since the last monetary policy announcement on 17th January 2014. Also playing role in positively influencing market sentiments is the larger than anticipated decline in CPI inflation. On the back of month-on-month deceleration in inflation in two of the last three months, the year-on-year inflation has come down to. percent in February 2014. This is broadly in line with SBP's earlier assessment that pickup in economic activity is more likely to be reflection of increased utilization of idle productive capacity rather than marginal increase in aggregate demand. In other words, growth of. percent in the LSM sector is an indicator of improved aggregate supply, which bodes well for containing inflation. These trends, including exchange rate appreciation, have improved the inflation outlook with higher likelihood of average inflation remaining within single digits for FY14. Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Declining inflation together with rising confidence in the market has helped the fiscal authority in meeting their incremental borrowing needs from the long-term Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) rather than the short-term Treasury Bills (T-bills). However the stock of fiscal borrowings from SBP (on cash basis), at Rs2669 billion on 7th March 2014, remains at higher level. Reducing fiscal borrowings from the SBP would also be critical in keeping the growth in Net Domestic Asset (NDA) of SBP within the agreed targets. In this vein, timely materialization of anticipated foreign inflows is an important factor. Not only will it help in the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves but also in keeping key monetary aggregates on desired path. Based on these considerations, the SBP's Board of Directors has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 10. percent. Page of."
Turkiye,2014-03-18,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 12 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 11.5 percent, and borrowing rate at 8 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 10 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 15 percent. The Committee highlighted the upside risks on the inflation outlook and assessed that the strong and frontloaded monetary tightening delivered at the January interim meeting has contained the adverse impact of such risks on the medium term inflation expectations. Yet, inflation is expected to increase until June, partly reflecting base effects. Against this backdrop, inflation expectations and pricing behavior will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. Loan growth continues to slow down in response to the tight monetary policy stance, recent macroprudential measures, and weak capital flows. In line with these developments, the data regarding the first quarter of 2014 indicate some deceleration in private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, with the help of the recovery in foreign demand, the contribution of net exports to economic growth is expected to increase. The Committee expects that such a demand composition will support disinflation and lead to a significant improvement in the current account deficit in 2014. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
United States,2014-03-19,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that growth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions. Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. The unemployment rate, however, remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment continued to advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in April, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $25 billion per month rather than $30 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $30 billion per month rather than $35 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. With the unemployment rate nearing 6-1/2 percent, the Committee has updated its forward guidance. The change in the Committee's guidance does not indicate any change in the Committee's policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Richard W Fisher; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I Plosser; Jerome H Powell; Jeremy C Stein; and Daniel K Tarullo. Voting against the action was Narayana Kocherlakota, who supported the sixth paragraph, but believed the fifth paragraph weakens the credibility of the Committee's commitment to return inflation to the 2 percent target from below and fosters policy uncertainty that hinders economic activity.

Israel,2014-03-24,"The CPI for the month of February declined by 0.2 percent. The inflation environment is located within the bottom portion of the target range,and it is likely that over the next several months, inflation over the preceding 12 months will decline temporarily to below the target range, thoughit is expected to return to within the target toward the beginning of 2015. Inflation expectations for one year ahead are within the target range, below the midpoint of the inflation target. Data which became available this month continue to indicate moderate economic growth, and some recovery in the growth rate is seen in the first quarter of 2014. In particular, a recovery in private consumption is apparent, as well as some increase in exports, which is focused for now on high tech and business services industries. Other manufacturing exports remain at avirtual standstill. Labor Force Survey data indicate elevated employment and low unemployment, derived from structural factors as well; the increase in the number of employee posts in the business sector remains moderate. In the past month, the shekel appreciated by 1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate; since the beginning of 2013, there has been a cumulative appreciation of 8.2 percent. There is a renewed trend of growth in world trade, and the global economy is expected to continue to grow moderately. Mixed data were reported in the US this month, primarily against the background of severe weather, but the tapering process continues and the interest rate path projected by FOMCmembers rose, reflecting an expectation for continued recovery. In Europe,the growth forecast was revised slightly upward. Weakness remains apparentin emerging markets. The pace of home price appreciation moderated this month, and over the past year they have increased by 6.3 percent. There is a continued high volume of mortgages taken out. With that, the improvement in risk characteristics of the new mortgages continues. The housing market policy steps being considered are likely to lead to volatility in volumes of activity and in prices in the market in coming months. <img width 3D 16 height 3D 16 class 3Dms-asset-icon ms-rtePosition-4 src alt 3D>To view this press release as a Word document. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined by 0.2 percent in February, in line with forecasters' projections. Components with marked declines were food, clothing and footwear, and communications (as mobile communications prices continued to decline). These were offset primarily by increases in the housing and fruit and vegetable components. The rate of inflation over the preceding 12 months continues to decline, and was 1.2 percent in February, compared with 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in January. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Private forecasters' inflation projections for the next 12 CPI readings were unchanged this month, and average 1.6 percent. Inflation expectations derived from the capital market declined to 1.6 percent, and expectations for the next 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates declined to 1.2 percent. The inflation path projected by some forecasters indicates that it is likely that the annual rate of inflation will decline to below the target during 2014, and will return to it toward the beginning of 2015. Inflation expectations for medium and long terms did not change markedly this month, and remain slightly above the midpoint of the inflation target range. Private forecasters do not expect a change in the interest rate in the coming three months, but data derived from the Telbor interest rates and the makam curve indicate some probability of one reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate in the coming months. Real economic activity: Data that became available this month continue to indicate that the economy is growing at a moderate pace, with some recovery in the first quarter and change in the composition of growth. In the second estimate of National Accounts data for the fourth quarter of 2013 (seasonally adjusted, annual terms), growth of business sector product was revised from 1.6 percent to 2.1 percent, though this is primarily a result of a downward revision of the level of business sector product for the third quarter. In February, there was a slight decline of 2 percent in goods exports (excluding ships and aircraft and diamonds). With that, against the background of an increase in world trade, a trend of growth in exports is becoming apparent over time, as a result of an increase in exports and production of high technology industries. Other manufacturing exports remain at a virtual standstill. In recent months there has been a continued trend of growth in exports to Asia, reaching an average of about $1 billion per month. In January, there was an atypical increase of 5.4 percent in businessservices exports (excluding start-up companies). Imports (excluding ships,aircraft, diamonds, and energy products) declined by about 2.5 percent in February, and the trend of increase in raw materials imports halted. In 2013, there was a current account surplus of $7 billion, of which $2.2 billionwas in the fourth quarter. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.2 percent in February, with a marked increase in trade and services revenue indices. The Climate Index, based on the Business Tendency Surveyof the Central Bureau of Statistics, reflects a monthly growth rate of 0.28 percent in the business sector. The Purchasing Managers Index for February rose above the 50 point level, considered the bound between contraction and growth of activity. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics increased slightly this month and the index compiledby Bank Hapoalim remained unchanged; both continue to indicate pessimism among consumers. The labor market: Labor Force Survey data for January indicate a slight increase in the unemployment rate among 25-64 year olds, to 5.4 percent, at the same time as an increase in the participation rate and the employment rate. The overall unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.9 percent. In December there was a slight increase in the number of employee posts of Israelis in the business sector (0.25 percent) and in public services (0.14 percent). However, it is still not a change in the trend seenover the past two years, in which employment of Israelis virtually did notincrease in the business sector, while it increased in public services. Nominal wages increased by 0.2 percent, and real wages declined by 0.1 percent, in October-December, compared with July-September. Health tax receipts by the National Insurance Institute, which provide an indication of total wage payments in the economy, were 4.8 percent higher in January-February, on a nominal basis, than in the corresponding two months of the previous year. After several months of decline in the number of job vacancies in the business sector, including a prolonged decline in the number of job vacancies in the construction industry, the overall figure stabilizedat around 60,000. Budget data: In February, the government's domestic surplus excluding net credit was NIS 2.3 billion, similar to the seasonal pathconsistent with staying within the deficit ceiling for 2014, compared witha deficit of NIS 1.6 billion in February 2013. This sum was affected by one-time revenues of about NIS 1.4 billion in January. Tax revenues were about NIS 19.8 billion in February, about NIS 0.2 billion below the seasonal path consistent with the tax revenues projected in the budget. Gross VAT receipts on domestic production, which serve as an indication of the level of economic activity, increased by about 12 percent in real terms compared withFebruary 2013, and excluding legislative changes the increase was about 6 percent. Research Department staff forecast: This month the Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast. The notice of the forecast is published in parallel with this release. According to the updated Research Department staff forecast, the inflation rate over the next 4 quarters (until the first quarter of 2015) will be 1.6 percent and the Bank of Israel interest rate is expected to remain at 0.75 percent through 2014 and to begin to be increased at a moderate rate in 2015. The staff forecast also projects GDP to increase in 2014 by 3.1 percent (3.3 percent in the previous forecast), and excluding the effect of natural gas production, to increase by 2.8 percent (2.9 percent in the previous forecast); in 2015. GDP is expected to grow by 3 percent: natural gas production is expected to stabilize and thus is not projected to contribute to GDP growth in that year. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on February 23, 2014, through March 21, 2014, the shekel appreciated by 0.9 percent against the dollar and by 0.3 percent against the euro. In termsof the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel strengthened by about 1 percent this month, and by about 8.2 percent since the beginning of 2013. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on February 23, 2014, through March 21, 2014, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by 4.6 percent, a greater return than the trend in advanced economies. Government bond yields declined, on the unindexed and CPI-indexed curve,by a rate similar to the global trend: against the background of, among other things, the reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate in theprevious month. The yield to maturity on a 10-year unindexed bond declinedby 17 basis points to 3.41 percent. The yield differential between 10-yearIsraeli government bonds and 10-year US Treasury securities declined to 66 basis points. Makam yields declined by about 25 basis points along the entire curve, against the background of the interest rate reduction in the previous month, and the 1-year yield is 0.64 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread declined slightly toaround 90 basis points. The Tel-Bond 60 Index increased by 1.5 percent. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in February, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 17.0 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 7.3 percent. Developments in the credit markets: Total outstanding debt of the business sector increased by about NIS 1.5 billion (0.2 percent) in January, to NIS 780 billion, primarily as a result of debt raised through bond issuances and direct loans from institutional investors. The funds raised were partly offset by bank credit repaid. In February, there was unusually large bond issuance volume, of NIS 5.3 billion, by the business sector, primarily resulting from a large issue of foreign currency-indexed bonds by onecompany. Corporate bond market spreads remained low from an historical perspective, and in the construction and real estate industry there was an additional decline in spreads. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 0.6 billion (0.1 percent) in January, to about NIS 410 billion at month end. Most of the increase was in housing credit, offset by, among other things, a decline in CPI-indexed credit due to the CPI decline. In February, new mortgages taken out totaled NIS 4.2 billion, similar to the monthly average for 2013. The trend of decline continues in new mortgages' risk characteristics: the loan to value ratio, the payment to income ratio, and the share of mortgages granted at variable rate interest. In February, the average interest rate on new mortgages taken outwas stable on all indexation tracks, after declining in December and January. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.3 percent in February. In the 12 months ending in February, this component increased by 3.1 percent, compared with an increase of 2.4 percent in the 12 months ended in January. Home prices, which are measured in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home pricesbut are not included in the CPI, increased by 0.1 percent in December-January, and previous indices were revised downward. Over the 12 months ending in January, prices increased by 6.3 percent, compared with an increase of 8.0 percent in the 12 months ended in December. The stock of unsold homes remained stable in January. The increase in construction industry activity continued: in 2013 there were 44,300 building starts (an increase of 3.4 percent from 2012), and 42,000 building completions (an increase of 11.8 percent compared with 2012). The housing market policy measures being discussed are likely to lead to volatility in volumes of activity and in pricesin the market in coming months. The global economy: The OECD forecasts continued recovery in advanced economies and in world trade, though a global recovery is expected to remain moderate against the background of weakness in emerging markets. In the US, the rate of economic growth in the fourth quarter was revised downward, and data published this month were mixed, still against the background of harsh weather. The stronger-than-expected increase in the number of nonfarm payrolls, the increase in nominal wages, and various indicators pointing to increased demand for workers were all notable positives. Although the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percent this month, to 6.7 percent, the civilian labor force participation rate was stable, which may indicate the return to the labor market of individuals who had become discouraged about the possibility of finding work. Notable to the downside were the balance of trade, real estate data, and the Purchasing Managers Index. The Fed continues the process of tapering its asset purchases, and announced that it would consider a wide range of data as the basis for a decision on when to increase the federal funds rate. The interest rate path expected by FOMC members increased compared with the previous meeting, and the rate is expected to reach 1 percent at the end of 2015. In Europe, macro data were mostly positive this month: purchasing managers indices increased by more than expected, and retail sales increased. In contrast, the unemployment rate remained elevated and business credit continued to decline. The ECB revised its growth forecast for 2014 slightly upward, to 1.2 percent. Concern over deflation remains, but it is assessed that the central bank will not actagainst it in the coming months. With that, the ECB president noted that the interest rate is expected to remain at its current level, or lower, for an extended period of time. Yields continued to decline in Spain and Italy.In Japan, strong growth is projected for the first quarter, but growth is expected to be negative in the second quarter, against the background of a VAT increase which will come into effect in April. In China, macro data indicated relative weakness, and uncertainty increased over the need for structural changes and credit market developments. In India, macro data pointed to recovery, and data were mixed in Brazil. However, overall capital outflows from emerging markets continued. The uncertainty about the situation in Ukraine is liable to impact on European economies, and so far it has been reflected in price declines of equities in Europe. This month, the price of a barrel of oil (Brent crude) declined by 3.2 percent, and the metals indexdeclined by 5 percent. The agricultural commodities index increased by 5.5 percent, against the background of severe weather conditions in many countries worldwide. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for April 2014 unchanged at 0.75 percent, after it was reduced last month, is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: The CPI for the month of February declined by 0.2 percent. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for April 2014 will be published on April 7, 2014. The decision regarding the interest rate for May 2014 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. April 28, 2014. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for April 2014 unchanged at 0.75 percent, after it was reduced last month, is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability."
Nigeria,2014-03-24,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 94 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. March 24-25, 2014 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on March 24 and 25, 2014 against the backdrop of challenging monetary policy environment; particularly, in the emerging markets and developing economies; coupled with the unfolding risks to stability in the domestic economy. In attendance were 9 members. The Committee reviewed key developments in both the global and domestic economies up to March 2014, and the outlook for the rest of the year. International Economic Developments The Committee noted that the recovery of the global economy could accelerate further in 2014 relative to 2013 as a result of increased domestic demand in the advanced economies and the rebound of exports in emerging 1 markets. The IMF has projected global growth to increase from 30 per cent in 2013 to 37 per cent in 2014 and then to 39 per cent in 2015. In the US, growth is expected to be 28 per cent in 2014, compared with 19 per cent in 2013, driven by increased domestic demand as well as reduction in the fiscal drag due to the recent deal brokered on the Federal Budget. Although the euro area has continued to adjust to a high level of indebtedness and financial fragmentation in some countries, growth is expected to recover in the coming years. Thus growth is expected to rise from 04 per cent in 2013 to 10 per cent in 2014. This is buoyed by easier credit conditions, increased investor confidence, and expansion in exports. Tight financial conditions since mid- 2013 as well as political uncertainty were a drag on growth in most of the emerging markets and developing economies. Notwithstanding overall growth in this group of 2 countries is expected to increase from 47 per cent in 2013 to 51 per cent in 2014. Reflecting the expansion in economic activities, an upward pressure is expected in global price levels in 2014. Global inflation is projected at 271 per cent in 2014, representing an increase of about 40 basis points in relation to the estimates for 2013. It is expected, however, that favorable developments in the prices of food and fuel will help contain the upward movement in the prices of major commodities. The Committee observed an emerging variance between advanced and emerging market economies (and developing economies) in terms of monetary policy stance since the beginning of 2014. While central banks in a number of advanced economies maintained the cautious posture adopted in 2013 and in Q1 of 2014, the emerging 3 economies and developing countries have apparently switched to more aggressive monetary policy tightening to support domestic currencies and retain foreign investments by raising interest rates. South Africa. Ghana. Brazil and Russia were among countries that tightened monetary policy to address concerns over rising risks to inflation and exchange rate stability. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output Growth remains robust. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has estimated real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate at 772 per cent for the fourth quarter of 2013, which was higher than the 681 per cent, recorded in Q3, 2013 and 699 per cent in the corresponding period of 2012. Thus in 2013. GDP grew at an estimated 689 per cent, up from 658 per cent in 2012. In line with recent trends, the 4 non-oil sector continued to be the main driver of growth in Q4, 2013, recording 876 per cent. The growth drivers in the non-oil sector in Q4, 2013 remained wholesale and retail trade, agriculture and telecommunications which contributed 257, 227 and 197 percentage points, respectively. Based on the 2013 favorable performance, output growth has been projected at 77 per cent for fiscal 2014. The Committee observed that the relatively robust growth projections, despite the sluggish global recovery, reflected the continuing favorable conditions for increased agricultural production, sustained outcome of the banking sector reforms as well as the initiatives of the government to stimulate the real economy. In particular, the Committee noted with satisfaction the rise by about 10 per cent in the national average electricity generation in Q4, 2013; a 5 development which provided impetus for improved economic activities during the period. Prices Inflation has remained in the target range. The downward trend in inflation, which commenced in December 2012 continued up to February 2014. The year-on-year headline inflation fell consistently from 95 per cent in February 2013 to 79 per cent in November 2013, but rose marginally to 80 per cent in December 2013 and January 2014. In February 2014, however, it moderated to 77 per cent. The deceleration was largely due to the moderation in food inflation, which moved from 93 per cent in January 2014 to 92 per cent in February 2014. Core inflation, on the other hand, exhibited a fair degree of volatility during the period; having declined up to the first half of 2013. It commenced an upward trend in the latter half of the period but declined 6 to 66 per cent in January 2014, before inching up to 72 per cent in February 2014. Noting the continued commitment of price stability within the CBN range, the Committee; emphasized the need to maintain the current monetary policy stance. In all, the Committee expressed satisfaction over the sustenance of single digit of all measures of inflation. The Committee, therefore, restated its commitment to sustaining the price stability objective. Monetary. Credit and Financial Markets' Developments Broad money supply (M2) contracted by 224 per cent in February 2014 over the level recorded at end-December 2013, which, on annualized basis, translated to a contraction of 1342 per cent as against a growth target of 1552 per cent for fiscal 2014. Net domestic credit grew marginally by 086 per cent in February 2014, translating to an annualized growth rate of 515 per cent. The annualized growth in net domestic credit is significantly lower than the provisional benchmark of 285 per cent for fiscal 2014. The sluggish growth in aggregate credit was traced mainly to the decline in Federal Government, borrowing which contracted by 202 per cent in February 2014 or 1214 per cent on an annualized basis. During the review period, money market interest rates remained within the MPR corridor, oscillating in tandem with 8 the level of liquidity in the banking system. The average interbank call rate for the period was 1017 per cent while the OBB rate was 1101 per cent. The weighted average inter-bank call and OBB rates which closed at 1086 and1046 per cent in December 2013, respectively, rose to 1127 and 105 per cent in February 2014. Activities in the capital market, however, were bearish as the All-Share Index (ASI) moderated from 41, 32919 at end-December 2013 to 39,,2694 on March 11, 2014 with market capitalization exhibiting similar trends. External Sector Developments The end-period exchange rate remained stable at the rDAS window but depreciated at the interbank appreciated at the BDC segment of the market. The exchange rate at the rDAS-SPT during the review period opened at N15761/US$ 9 (including 1% commission) and closed at N15726/US$, representing an appreciation of N035k or 022 per cent. At the Interbank foreign exchange market, the rate opened at N15883/US$ and closed at N16490/US$, averaging N16189/US$, representing a depreciation of 368 per cent or N6 for the period. At the BDC segment of the foreign exchange market, the selling rate opened at N17300/US$ and closed at N17200/US$, representing an appreciation of 058 per cent or N100k. The BDC segment averaged N17044/US$, representing an appreciation of 006 per cent. Gross official reserves as at March 2014 stood at US$3783 billion compared with US$4285 billion at end-December 2013. The decrease in the reserves level was driven largely by the increased funding of the foreign exchange market in 10 the face of intense pressure on the Naira and the need to maintain stability. The Committee's Considerations The Committee unanimously agreed that a continuation of a tight monetary policy was needed to consolidate recent gains. Recent resurgence of core inflation in spite of the downward trend in headline inflation reinforces this position. Thus prudent monetary stance would also facilitate better reserve and exchange rate management in an environment where Fed tapering increases pressure on emerging economies financial markets. The MPC welcomed the growth expectations but expressed concern that the industrial sector has continued to lag behind. The Committee noted that growth remained 11 consistently in favour of the agricultural sector, noting that the continued achievement of relative exchange rate stability and single digit inflation in 2014 given the risks in the horizon will require extra-ordinary measures. The Committee viewed some of the developments as positive optimism by the market relative to other emerging market economies. While tension in Ukraine over Russia's claims to Crimea remained serious, direct trade and financial links between Nigeria and the duo remained largely limited. Thus the risk premia could come from rising oil and gas prices which were deemed positive shocks. On the other hand, the Committee noted that the recent pressure in the foreign exchange market was in response to key developments in the US over the Fed's unwinding of its assets purchase programme. In addition, the pressure on 12 external reserves was deemed to be consistent with the seasonal annual payment of dividends to foreign investors. On a positive note, inflation forecasts indicate that food inflation may not grow beyond current levels, especially with bumper harvests expected in 2014. However core inflation could rise. The Committee noted that frontier markets were positioning themselves to attract higher capital inflows by raising their policy rates to contain inflation and also remain competitive. Oil prices remained relatively high while production was improving, and there were signs of accretion to external reserves. The Committee also expressed concern over the sudden surge in domiciliary account balances which may offset the gains from imposing 75 per cent CRR on public sector funds. 13 The Committee commended the Bank for its continued commitment to exchange rate stability in the face of undue pressure on the Naira. It noted with satisfaction the calm in the foreign exchange market and the relative stability in the interbank exchange rate after the initial turbulence. The Committee acknowledged that while this stability was at a high cost, safeguarding short run macroeconomic stability under the circumstance required firm and bold measures. In the light of the foregoing, the MPC considered the success of Monetary Policy in attaining price and exchange rate stability; the potential headwinds in 2014; the ultimate goal of transiting to a truly low – inflation environment; and the need to retain portfolio flows. The Committee unanimously voted for further tightening of monetary policy but were divided on the instruments. While some voted for 14 an increase in the MPR to retain and attract more inflows, other members felt that such increase could impact access to credit and domestic growth negatively. Consequently the Committee voted as follows: Five members voted to keep MPR at 12%, while four members voted for an increase in MPR. Seven members voted to retain the MPR corridor at +/-2%, while two members voted for an asymmetric corridor. Seven members voted to increase CRR on private sector deposits by 300 basis points to 15%, while two members voted to retain the CRR on private sector deposits at 12%. The Committee, therefore, decided by a majority vote of 5 to 4 to hold the MPR and its corridor at current levels but 15 raised the CRR on private sector deposits by 300 basis points to 15 per cent. Thank you for listening Sarah O Alade Acting Governor Central Bank of Nigeria 25th March, 2014 16."
Armenia,2014-03-25,"Press Release 25.03.2014 Interest rate unchanged, 7.5 percent In the March 25, 2014 Meeting, the Board of the CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of the CBA unchanged, at 7.5 percent. There was 1.2 percent of deflation in February of 2014, compared with 0.4 percent of deflation recorded in the same month of the previous year, with the 12-month inflation having amounted to 4.6 percent in late February. In the coming months, the Board considers, the 12-month inflation rate will continue to decline and rest closer to the lower bound of the confidence band most probably during the third quarter, which will be attributable to phasing out impact of energy prices increased back in July of 2013. The Board acknowledged that uncertainties in the external sector in connection with global economic outlook and growth perspectives in trade partners have increased considerably amidst geopolitical developments. The Board estimates that economic growth rates remain sluggish, mostly explained by a slow pace with which construction recovers. The Board thinks that eased monetary conditions, coupled with expansionary fiscal policy, which is expected since the second half of 2014, will lead to broadening of aggregate demand and rebounding inflation rates. Late in the year the 12-month inflation is expected to be around the target, as a result. In the meantime, the dram's exchange rate depreciated since the start of the year and the reserve requirement ratio lowered in February will contribute to the broadening of aggregate demand. Yet, the Board admits that future economic developments in both external and domestic environments may prompt the CBA to steer further directions of the monetary policy while attempting to attain the inflation target in the medium run. More information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on the Policy Rate) due on April 4, 2014. Press Service of the Central Bank."
Hungary,2014-03-25,"25 March 2014 - At its meeting on 25 March 2014, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 10 basis points from 2.70% to 2.60%, with effect from 26 March 2014. Since August 2012, the Monetary Council has reduced the central bank base rate significantly. These reductions in the base rate were justified by the low inflation environment, subdued inflationary pressures over the medium term and a degree of spare capacity in the economy. Perceptions of the risks associated with the economy were also generally supportive. In the Council's judgement, the significant reduction in the base rate implemented so far has helped the Bank achieve the inflation target over the medium term and has contributed to the strengthening of domestic economic growth. The Council's aim remains to maintain a balanced and conservative approach to monetary policy. In addition to the priority of meeting the inflation target, the Council also takes into account the condition of the real economy and incorporates financial stability considerations into its decisions. A marked and sustained shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. Looking ahead, inflation is likely to move in line with price stability; disinflation is expected to slow gradually. In the Council's judgement, inflation is likely to remain below the 3 per cent target in 2014, before moving into line with the medium-term inflation target from 2015. The inflation rate has been at historically low levels in recent months. Subdued inflation in external markets, the degree of unused capacity in the economy, the fall in inflation expectations and the reductions in regulated prices, implemented in a series of steps, have contributed to the development of a low inflation environment. However, the weaker exchange rate of recent months has passed through gradually to the prices of core inflation items, which in turn points to higher underlying inflation. Capacity utilisation is likely to rise gradually as economic activity continues to recover. Household consumption, however, which is relevant in terms of inflation pressures from the domestic real economy, is likely to grow only slowly, and therefore the real economic environment is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact, although to a declining extent. In addition, the loose labour market and the adjustment of inflation expectations also suggest that moderate wage growth is likely to continue, which in turn will contribute to inflation moving in line with the Bank's inflation target looking forward. The low inflation environment may help the Bank's inflation target to better anchor the nominal path of the economy. The Council judges that the Hungarian economy returned to a growth path in 2013. Looking ahead, economic growth is likely to continue. Economic activity picked up gradually in the past quarters, with output rising across a wide range of sectors. Looking ahead. Hungarian economic growth may continue in a more balanced pattern than previously. Rising exports are likely to play an important role as a source of growth in the coming years, supported by new production capacity in the automobile industry brought into production and the improvement in competitiveness, in addition to the recovery in economic activity abroad. Domestic demand is expected to strengthen in the coming years. Investments are likely to pick up further, reflecting the improvement in the outlook for activity, the easing in credit constraints due to the Bank's Funding for Growth Scheme and the increasing use of EU funding. However, household consumption is likely to grow only gradually, even as disposable income increases. Propensity to save is expected to remain high, reflecting the ongoing reduction in debts accumulated during the years prior to the crisis and the slow improvement in credit conditions. Hungary's external debt is expected to fall further. The external financing capacity of the Hungarian economy continued to rise towards the end of 2013 and the external debt ratios fell significantly. The external surplus is likely to remain high in the coming years as the trade surplus stabilises at a high level, despite accelerating growth in consumption and investment. The improvement in the terms of trade and the pick-up in export growth as external demand recovers are likely to play a dominant role in this. The transfer balance is expected to fall slightly, due to the new budget cycle of the EU, but is likely to remain above levels recorded in previous years. With the external financing capacity remaining high, the external debt ratio is likely to fall further, which in turn will reduce the country's vulnerability. The Hungarian risk premium did not change significantly in the past quarter, but volatility increased in financial markets. Due to the Fed's decision to further reduce the pace of its asset purchases, the increased focus on the vulnerability of some emerging economies and the escalation of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, global investor sentiment has been volatile in the past quarter. Domestic risk premia have been little changed since publication of the December issue of the Bank's Quarterly Report on Inflation. The CDS spread and the spreads on foreign currency bonds fell slightly, long-term yields rose modestly and the exchange rate depreciated, accompanied by significant volatility. The volatility of the major risk indicators increased relative to previous quarters. Nevertheless. Hungary's position is fundamentally strong compared to other emerging market economies. The country's persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are reducing its vulnerability. In the Council's judgement, a cautious approach to policy is warranted by uncertainty related to the global financial environment. The macroeconomic outlook is surrounded by both upside and downside risks. The Monetary Council identified three alternative scenarios around the baseline projection of the MarchReport on Inflation, which might significantly influence the future conduct of monetary policy. In the alternative scenario assuming a persistently low external inflation environment and a slower-than-expected recovery in external demand, the inflation target may be achieved with looser monetary conditions than assumed in the baseline scenario. In the risk scenario assuming an unfavourable external environment and higher investor risk aversion, inflation moves in line with price stability in the medium term under tighter monetary conditions than implied by the baseline projection. A third scenario, assuming a pick-up in domestic employment and consumption, resulting in weaker domestic disinflationary pressures, also implies a tighter monetary policy stance. After reviewing the projection in the March Report, the Council judges that there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflation is likely to move in line with the target in the medium term. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the monetary policy horizon, and therefore the disinflationary impact of the real economy is likely to decrease looking forward. In the Council's judgement, there remained some scope for a cautious reduction in interest rates in the context of heightened uncertainty in global financial markets; however, a smaller reduction in interest rates than previously was warranted by the increase in uncertainty. Considering the substantial reduction in interest rates so far, changes in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy and based on currently available information, the central bank base rate has significantly approached a level which ensures the medium-term achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support for the economy. In case of a significant deterioration in global financial market environment, the Council will see no scope for continuing the easing cycle. THE MONETARY COUNCIL'S STATEMENT ON MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND ITS MONETARY POLICY ASSESSMENT."
Georgia,2014-03-26,"26.03.14 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate unchanged at 4.00%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on March 26, 2014 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 4 percent. Despite keeping the rate unchanged, the Committee still considers a gradual exit from the accommodative monetary policy to be necessary, conditional on the robust recovery of the economy and the inflation forecast approaching its target. However, taking into consideration that geopolitical risks in our region have recently increased, which increases economic uncertainty, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this stage. The future path of the monetary policy rate depends on the dynamics of the inflation forecast, the speed of economic recovery, and the global and, especially, regional economic environment. The MPC's decision and forward view is underpinned by the macroeconomic forecast; according to which, inflation will reach its target of 5-6 percent in the second half of 2014. This is due to an expected improvement in aggregate demand, coupled with the transmission of the effective exchange rate movement into import prices and the removal of the base effect from the inflation rate. It is the view of the Committee that this forecast is balanced by risks from both sides, although recent geopolitical events in the region contain additional uncertainty for the economic environment. The deterioration of the economic environment in the region may affect the Georgian economy through several channels. The most important of which are a decrease in export demand and investor sentiment, and a reduction in remittances from abroad. As for the situational background of the forecast, economic growth indicators have been improving since the 4th quarter of last year, thus contributing to the inflation level reaching its target value. Annual inflation in February was 3.5%. Preliminary indicators also indicate moderate growth in economic activity at the beginning of the current year. According to Geostat estimates, annual economic growth reached 7.8% in January. According to current data, positive tendencies will also be maintained in external demand, which will be reflected in export growth. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets both domestically and abroad. The NBG will use all its tools available to ensure its main objective of price stability, which in the long run leads to increased economic growth and low unemployment, as well as promote the stability of the financial sector and its development. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on May 7, 2014."
Philippines,2014-03-26,"Statement by BSP Governor Amando M Tetangco. At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy rates at3.50 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 5.50 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs and RPs as well as SDAs were also kept steady. Meanwhile, the Monetary Board decided to increase the reserve requirement by one percentage point effective on 4 April 2014. In deciding to maintain policy rates, the Monetary Board noted that the future inflation path is likely to stay within the target ranges of 4±1 percent for 2014 and 3±1 percent for 2015. Inflation expectations also remain broadly aligned with the target over the policy horizon. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook continues to be skewed to the upside, with potential price pressures emanating from pending petitions for adjustments in utility rates and from the possible increases in food and oil prices. The Monetary Board's decision to raise the reserve requirement is intended to guard against potential risks to financial stability that could arise from continued strong liquidity growth and rapid credit expansion. The Monetary Board concluded that buoyant domestic growth prospects allow some scope for a measured adjustment in the BSP's policy instruments amid the ongoing normalization of monetary policy overseas. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions and will consider further adjustments in its monetary policy tools as necessary to safeguard price and financial stability."
Czech Republic,2014-03-27,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged, i.e. at technical zero. The Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna against the euro so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. The nature of this exchange rate commitment is unchanged.. This decision is based on the message of the current forecast and on an assessment of newly available information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. The forecast expects market interest rates to be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate to stay close to CZK 27 to the euro until the start of next year. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the forecast as being slightly anti-inflationary. The Bank Board continues to view the level of the exchange rate commitment at CZK 27 to the euro as appropriate and expects the exchange rate to be kept close to this level at least  with the emphasis on “at least”  until the start of 2015. According to the Bank Board, this ensures that the monetary conditions will be eased to the necessary extent. At the start of this year, annual headline inflation dropped sharply in line with the forecast, reaching very low  albeit positive  levels, with prices increasing by just 0.2% year on year in both January and February. The slight downward deviation from the forecast was due chiefly to a deeper decline in administered prices. It can be said that the weakened exchange rate has so far been feeding through to prices in line with the forecast, and without this effect inflation would have been strongly negative. This again confirms that the decision made by the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank in November has significantly contributed to averting the threat of deflation. In line with the forecast, economic activity recovered in 2013 Q4 and even recorded a noticeably stronger rate of growth. This was due mainly to an increase in fixed investment which had not been expected by the forecast. Fixed investment does not usually have any immediate inflationary effects, and this time was no exception. Overall, the domestic economy bottomed out in the second half of last year. However, the output gap remained significantly negative and the domestic economy thus remained anti-inflationary in line with the forecast. New information on developments abroad obtained from market outlooks and the March Consensus Forecasts survey does not change the economic growth outlook for the effective euro area for 2014 and 2015. However, consumer price outlook has shifted slightly further downwards, as has the producer price outlook for this year. The market outlook for foreign rates has declined only negligibly at the longer horizon, still reflecting expectations of continued accommodative monetary policy of the European Central Bank. Expected oil prices have moved roughly two dollars a barrel higher this year and the next, although a shift in the path of the outlook for the euro-dollar exchange rate towards a weaker dollar is acting in the opposite direction in terms of euro and koruna prices of oil. In line with the forecast, wages in the business sector fell year on year in 2013 Q4. However, data adjusted for the expected effect of tax optimisation in late 2012 and early 2013 also point to a decline, while the forecast had expected a slight increase. This indicates that the previous long-running economic decline has led to even stronger anti-inflationary  or even deflationary  wage tendencies than expected in the forecast. At the same time, however, signs of a positive turnaround are emerging on the labour market in line with our expectations. This is evidenced by an observed halt in the rise in the share of unemployed persons and a rise in wages in industry and construction in January. Indicators from the real economy are signalling a continued economic recovery at the start of this year. Industrial production is still recording noticeable year-on-year growth, and construction output also recovered in January after a long decline. Retail sales continued to grow in late 2013 and early 2014, especially in the automotive segment. However, sales of other goods are rising moderately as well. This suggests that the increase in household consumption at the end of last year may be of a longer-lasting nature. Producer price inflation remains subdued but returned to slightly positive annual figures in manufacturing following the weakening of the koruna. In industry as a whole, by contrast, slightly negative figures were recorded as a result of a decrease in electricity prices. New data also suggest a gradual moderation of the year-on-year declines in prices of construction work and market services. On the other hand, agricultural producer prices are still declining year on year, dampening upward cost pressures on food prices in line with the assumptions of our forecast. To sum up, annual GDP growth returned to positive figures in line with the forecast in 2013 Q4, but was considerably stronger than forecasted. In line with the forecast, inflation fell to low positive levels in the first two months of this year. The average wage in the whole economy saw an even sharper year-on-year decrease in 2013 Q4 compared to the forecast. As expected in the forecast, growth in the seasonally adjusted share of unemployed persons halted close to 8% in January and February."
South Africa,2014-03-27,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 27 March 2014 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the global economic environment remains challenging, notwithstanding some improvement in sentiment. Key factors affecting the environment include the possibility of an earlier-than-expected increase in the US policy rate in 2015, further evidence of a slowdown in China, and geo-political tensions arising from the situation in Ukraine. The domestic economic outlook remains subdued amid continued strikes in the platinum sector and uncertainty regarding a stable and sufficient electricity supply in the coming months. While the most recent inflation forecasts suggest marginal improvements in the medium term, upside risks to the inflation outlook persist despite the recent appreciation of the rand, which remains vulnerable to shifts in 1. While the most recent inflation forecasts suggest marginal improvements in the medium term, upside risks to the inflation outlook persist despite the recent appreciation of the rand, which remains vulnerable to shifts in 1 global risk sentiment and adverse domestic developments. Together with downside risks to growth, this continues to pose a dilemma for monetary policy. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 5,8 per cent and 5,9 per cent in January and February 2014 respectively, up from 5,4 per cent in December. This marked upward trend was in line with the Bank's forecasts. Food and non-alcoholic beverage price inflation reversed its previous downward trend, measuring 4,3 per cent and 5,4 per cent in the past two months, compared with a recent low of 3,5 per cent in December. The contribution of this category to the overall CPI inflation increase was 0,8 percentage points in February compared with 0,5 in December. The petrol price, which was the other main contributor to the higher CPI inflation in February, increased at a year-on-year rate of 14,0 per cent. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, was unchanged at 5,3 per cent, the sixth consecutive month at this level. This was despite upward pressures from exchange rate sensitive categories such as clothing and footwear, and motor vehicle inflation, which were offset to some extent by a lower rate of increase in medical insurance costs. Administered price inflation excluding petrol measured 6,9 per cent. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 7,7 per cent in February, compared with 7,0 per cent in January. The Bank's forecast of headline inflation is unchanged for 2014, and is expected to average 6,3 per cent, with the peak of 6,6 per cent still expected in the fourth 2. The Bank's forecast of headline inflation is unchanged for 2014, and is expected to average 6,3 per cent, with the peak of 6,6 per cent still expected in the fourth 2 quarter. The forecast average inflation for 2015 declined from 6,0 per cent previously, to 5,8 per cent, with inflation expected to average 5,6 per cent in the final quarter of that year, compared with 5,9 per cent previously. This improvement is mainly the result of the lagged effect of the repo rate increase. Inflation is still expected to breach the upper end of the target range in the second quarter of 2014, and to return to within the target range in the second quarter of 2015, when it is expected to measure 5,9 per cent. The outlook for core inflation has improved, and is expected to average 5,6 per cent in both 2014 and 2015, compared with the previous forecast of 5,8 per cent and 5,9 per cent for these two years respectively. Notwithstanding this improvement, the upward pressures continue to be seen to be coming from the lagged effects of the exchange rate depreciation. The MPC still assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be skewed to the upside, as extended periods of overshooting of the exchange rate remain a possibility in the current uncertain global environment. There is also a risk that the current low level of pass-through may not persist. Inflation expectations as measured by the survey conducted by the BER in the first quarter of 2014 remained unchanged at an average of 6,1 per cent for both 2014 and 2015, with inflation of 5,9 per cent expected in 2016. Although the 2014 expectations of analysts increased to 6,1 per cent from 5,6 per cent in the previous survey, expectations of business people declined to 6,2 per cent from 3. Although the 2014 expectations of analysts increased to 6,1 per cent from 5,6 per cent in the previous survey, expectations of business people declined to 6,2 per cent from 3 6,4 per cent, with trade union expectations unchanged at 6,1 per cent. Analysts expect inflation to moderate during the next two years to within the target range, whilst business and labour respondents expect inflation to remain steady at just over 6 per cent, indicating that expectations continue to be relatively well anchored, albeit at the upper end of the target band. The Reuters survey of economic analysts conducted in March shows that inflation expectations of economists are more or less unchanged since the previous survey, and also remain, on average, anchored at the upper end of the band. The expectation is that inflation will breach the upper end of the target range in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, at an average rate of 6,1 per cent, before returning to within the target range. The global economic recovery continues to be uneven, with a first quarter slowdown in growth in the advanced economies compared with the fourth quarter of 2013, due in part to severe weather conditions, particularly in the US. Nevertheless, the underlying US growth prospects remain relatively favourable despite a slower pace of employment growth, amid positive investment and consumption indicators. The UK economy continues to show signs of sustained improvement, with declining inflation and unemployment rates as well as a buoyant housing market. The Eurozone growth prospects remain weak, although there are signs of a modest recovery, and the unemployment rate appears to 4. The Eurozone growth prospects remain weak, although there are signs of a modest recovery, and the unemployment rate appears to 4 have peaked. Japanese economic growth in the fourth quarter was lower than expected, and there are indications that the recovery could be losing momentum. The global outlook, however, is overshadowed by unfolding developments in the Ukraine and Russia regarding Crimea, although to date contagion effects have been limited to those countries with direct trade and financial links with the region. The other downside risk factor relates to a deteriorating outlook in a number of the larger emerging market economies, including Brazil. Russia and China. Recent short-term data from China indicate that economic growth could decline below the government's target of 7,5 per cent, at a time of increased risks in the banking sector. The slowdown in China is expected to maintain downward pressure on global commodity prices, particularly industrial commodities, while there are upside risks to some commodities, particularly oil and grains, from the tensions in Crimea. Global inflation pressures remain benign, particularly in the advanced economies. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the US has continued its steady path of tapering, although the financial markets now believe that the first interest rate increases may occur earlier in 2015 than previously expected. Over the same period, monetary policy has been tightened in New Zealand. Brazil and Russia, and loosened in Israel. Thailand. Chile and Hungary. 5 The exchange rate of the rand has been relatively volatile since the previous meeting of the MPC, having fluctuated in a wide range between R11,39 and R10,60 against the US dollar. There has been an appreciating trend over this period, in line with an improving risk sentiment towards emerging markets. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has appreciated by about 2,4 per cent against the US dollar, and by 2,2 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. While the risk to the inflation outlook from the exchange rate may have moderated somewhat since the previous meeting, these risks are still assessed to be on the upside. The MPC is of the view that the exchange rate will continue to be highly sensitive to both domestic and global developments, remaining prone to further bouts of volatility and protracted periods of overshooting. The current account of the balance of payments narrowed significantly from 6,4 per cent of GDP (revised down from 6,8 per cent previously) in the third quarter of 2013, to 5,1 per cent of GDP in the following quarter, with a deficit for the year of 5,8 per cent. The contraction of the trade account was a result of both a 3,6 per cent decline in the value of merchandise imports and a 0,9 per cent increase in export earnings. Although we expect the current account to respond to the depreciated exchange rate, this adjustment is likely to be gradual and some widening of the trade deficit is expected in the first quarter of 2014. Constraining factors include the protracted nature of the strike in the platinum sector, and the relatively inelastic import demand, particularly with respect to imported capital 6. Constraining factors include the protracted nature of the strike in the platinum sector, and the relatively inelastic import demand, particularly with respect to imported capital 6 equipment. Promisingly, net exports made positive contributions to GDP growth in the final two quarters of 2013. Tapering by the US Fed and the expectation of US interest rate normalisation continued to impact on the pattern of global capital flows and financial market volatility. The domestic yield curve flattened since the previous MPC meeting, as the short end increased in response to monetary tightening, while the long end of the curve shifted downwards. In contrast to emerging markets in general. South Africa experienced net inflows into the equity markets in February and March, totalling R11,6 billion, following net sales of R25,1 billion between November 2013 and January 2014. Non-residents remained net sellers of bonds but at a slower pace: net sales of bonds amounted to R46,0 billion over the same three month period, but moderated to R1,2 billion in February, and net purchases of R2,1 billion in March to date. The domestic economic growth outlook remains subdued. Despite a rebound in the fourth quarter of 2013, when an annualised growth rate of 3,8 per cent was recorded, economic growth is expected to remain below potential of between 3,0 per cent and 3,5 per cent in 2014, with a consequent widening output gap. The Bank's forecast for economic growth has declined marginally to 2,6 per cent in 2014, compared with 2,8 per cent previously, while the forecast for 2015 has been revised down from 3,3 per cent to 3,1 per cent. The risks to this forecast are seen to be on the downside, given the protracted strike in the platinum sector and 7. The risks to this forecast are seen to be on the downside, given the protracted strike in the platinum sector and 7 electricity supply constraints. This deterioration comes amid continued low levels of business confidence, with the RMB/BER business confidence index declining to 41 index points in the first quarter of 2014, the fourth consecutive month at a level below the neutral 50 index points. The sideways movement of the composite leading business cycle indicator of the Bank also points to a restrained outlook. The growth outcome in the fourth quarter of 2013 was led by strong growth in the manufacturing sector in particular, following the strike-induced contraction in the previous quarter. In January, a 2,5 per cent year-on-year rate of growth in manufacturing output was recorded. According to the BER manufacturing survey, business confidence in the sector remains low despite increasing to 41 index points in the first quarter, from 36 previously. There are, however, some positive signs in the sector, with the Kagiso PMI increasing to 51,7 index points in February, and the BER's indicators for manufacturing export sales and orders improving further in the first quarter of 2014, to their highest level in 10 years. Despite a strong performance in the fourth quarter, the outlook for the mining sector remains bleak: mining output contracted at a month-on-month rate of 1,1 per cent in January, and the on-going strike in the platinum sector is likely to impact adversely on mining output and exports. 8 Growth in real gross fixed capital formation accelerated to 4,7 per cent in 2013, compared with 4,4 per cent in the previous year. During the past year, real capital outlays by the private sector increased by 5,5 per cent, while public corporations and general government investment increased by 3,1 per cent and 3,5 per cent respectively. Consistent with moderate economic growth, employment growth has remained weak. According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics (QES) of Statistics South Africa, employment levels in the formal non-agricultural sector increased marginally at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0,2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2013, or by 5,100 employment opportunities. In the year to the fourth quarter of 2013, the increase was 0,5 per cent or 40,900 jobs, with the public sector contributing 39,000 of these jobs. Overall, private sector employment declined during the fourth quarter, with losses most pronounced in the gold mining, construction and electricity sectors. The weakening trend in the growth in household consumption expenditure continued into the final quarter of 2013, with growth of 2,0 per cent recorded, and its contribution to GDP growth declining from 2,3 percentage points in 2012 to 1,7 percentage points in 2013. Growth for the year averaged 2,6 per cent, while consumption expenditure by general government averaged 2,4 per cent. Household spending on durable goods remained firm, but grew at a slower pace of 6,9 per cent, and is likely to moderate further as vehicle sales come under 9. Household spending on durable goods remained firm, but grew at a slower pace of 6,9 per cent, and is likely to moderate further as vehicle sales come under 9 increasing pressure. Total domestic new vehicle sales declined in February by 2,6 per cent on a month-to-month basis and by 3,1 per cent year-on-year. Although real retail trade sales exceeded market expectations in January, following a month-to-month increase of 0,8 per cent, and a 6,8 per cent increase year-on-year, the outlook for consumption expenditure is expected to be constrained by slow employment growth, high debt levels of consumers, slow rates of growth in credit extension and the higher interest rate environment. Growth in government consumption expenditure is expected to be contained. According to the recent budget, the expenditure cap has been maintained, and a consolidated budget deficit of 4,0 per cent of GDP is estimated for 2014/15, in line with that of the past fiscal year. A faster pace of fiscal consolidation is indicated, with the deficit to GDP ratio expected to decline to 2,8 per cent in 2016/17. Bank credit extension to the private sector has maintained its weak underlying trend, particularly with respect to credit extended to households, reinforcing expected pressures on household consumption expenditure. By contrast, credit extension to the corporate sector was relatively robust, with growth rates of around 10 per cent. Although twelve-month growth in total loans and advances to the private sector increased from 6,4 per cent in December to 7,6 per cent in January, credit extension to households increased by 5,5 per cent and 5,6 per cent in these two months respectively. This probably reflects both supply and 10. This probably reflects both supply and 10 demand side considerations. Mortgage lending remained weak, with twelve- month growth of 2,1 per cent in January, amid moderate house price growth. Twelve-month growth in general loans, mainly unsecured lending, to households continued its downward trend, measuring 5,0 per cent in January, the lowest rate of growth since February 2005. Instalment sale credit and leasing finance has remained buoyant but growing at a more moderate pace, in line with declining vehicle sales. The trend in wage settlements has remained relatively unchanged. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements measured 7,9 per cent in 2013, compared with 7,6 per cent in 2012. Data from Stats SA show that the growth in nominal remuneration per worker increased from 6,7 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 2013, to 7,0 per cent in the fourth quarter. Once the slight increase in productivity growth is accounted for, this translates into a unit labour cost increase of 5,2 per cent in the fourth quarter. While this appears to be relatively contained, there are wide variations across sectors, and the outcome of wage negotiations during the year in an unsettled labour relations environment will be an important determinant of inflation pressures. As anticipated, the favourable trend of food prices in the consumer price index has reversed, and pressures are expected on headline inflation from this source, despite the moderation of prices at the global level. Having reached a recent low 11. Having reached a recent low 11 of 3,5 per cent in December 2013, consumer food price inflation increased to 4,3 per cent and 5,6 per cent in the subsequent two months. Final manufactured producer food price inflation accelerated to 7,6 per cent in February and further pressures are evident in the agricultural producer price inflation for cereals and other crops which accelerated from -8,2 per cent in August 2013 to 27,6 per cent in February 2014. This contributed to the 7,4 per cent increase in bread and cereals prices at the consumer price level in February. The wheat and maize prices reflect exchange rate pressures and domestic drought conditions. Although futures prices indicate some possible moderation in coming months following the recent rains, near-term pressures remain. International oil prices have been relatively unaffected by the Crimean crisis, and the price of Brent crude oil fluctuated between a relatively narrow range of US$106 and US$111 per barrel since the previous meeting. The exchange rate has been the main driver of the rand petrol price, which increased by a cumulative 75 cent per litre in February and March. The recent appreciation of the rand has resulted in a current over-recovery in the petrol price, and this is expected to offset in part the 20 cent per litre fuel levy increase, due to be implemented in April. The Monetary Policy Committee is acutely aware of the policy dilemma of rising inflation pressures in a subdued economic growth environment. Despite a 12 marginal improvement in the medium term inflation forecast, the trajectory remains uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. The main upside risk to the forecast continues to come from the exchange rate, which, despite the recent relative stability, remains vulnerable to global rebalancing. The expected normalisation of monetary policy in advanced economies is unlikely to be linear or smooth, and the timing and pace is uncertain. The rand is also vulnerable to domestic idiosyncratic factors, including protracted work stoppages, electricity supply constraints, and the slow adjustment of the current account deficit. Pass-through from the exchange rate to prices has been relatively muted to date but there is some evidence that it is accelerating. However, the forecast already incorporates a higher pass-through than has been experienced up to now. At the same time, the domestic economic outlook remains fragile, with the risks assessed to be on the downside. Demand pressures remain benign as consumption expenditure continues to slow amid weakening credit extension to households and high levels of household indebtedness. The upward trend in the core inflation forecast is assessed to reflect exchange rate pressures rather than underlying demand pressures. 13 Given the lags with which monetary policy operates, the MPC will continue to focus on the medium term inflation trajectory. The committee is aware that too slow a pace of tightening could undermine inflation expectations and may require more aggressive tightening in the future. Consistent with our mandate, a fine balance is required to ensure that inflation is contained while minimising the cost to output. The real policy rate is currently below what can be considered normal in the long run and is likely to increase over the medium term. The pace of tightening will depend on a number of factors including projected inflation, inflation expectations, the state of the economy and global developments. At this meeting the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,5 per cent per annum. We wish to reiterate that even though we are in a tightening cycle, there will not necessarily be a change in the stance at every meeting, and that the increments may not always be of the same magnitude.

Romania,2014-03-28,"The NBR reiterates that an adequate use of its available tools amid a close monitoring of domestic and global economic developments will ensure the achievement of its main objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term and ensure financial stability. The analysis of the latest developments in macroeconomic indicators points to further disinflation, in line with the path forecasted by the central bank, along with a recovery of economic activity. The annual inflation rate fell to a historical low of 1.05 percent in February 2014, from 1.55 percent at end-2013. At the same time, the average annual inflation rate went down to 3.2 percent in February 2014 from 3.6 percent in the previous month, while the average annual HICP inflation rate, which is relevant for ensuring comparability at European level and assessing convergence with the EU, kept declining to reach 2.6 percent in February versus 2.9 percent in January 2014. These developments and the favourable inflation outlook, amid a close monitoring of domestic and global developments, have enabled the central bank to adjust the monetary policy stance accordingly and to consolidate the monetary policy transmission mechanism, while effectively anchoring inflation expectations. Banking system liquidity posted fluctuations, with a surplus trend being manifest, thus keeping money market rates, especially short-term rates, below the monetary policy rate. The favourable liquidity picture, the decline in lending rates on new business following the successive policy rate cuts and the improvement in the evolution of lei-denominated loans create further prerequisites for the recovery of loans to the private sector. Nevertheless, private sector lending dynamics have remained weak as a result of the sizeable drop in foreign currency-denominated loans. The pick-up in economic activity was attributed to the favourable performance of net exports as well as to the improved domestic demand. On the supply side, industrial and agricultural output made the largest contributions to economic growth. The latest assessments reconfirm the prospects for the annual inflation rate to remain subdued over the months ahead, in the vicinity of historical lows. This outlook is in line with the previous forecast of the annual inflation rate returning and subsequently remaining inside the variation band of the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat target. The risks associated with this outlook stem primarily from external sources, namely capital flow volatility, owing to the variability of investors' risk appetite driven by geopolitical and regional developments, to the faster cross-border deleveraging across the banking system, as well as to the changes in overall exposure to the emerging economies. Against this backdrop, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged at 3.5 percent per annum, to continue to pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system, as well as to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The monetary policy conduct is aimed at sustainably preserving price stability over the medium term in line with the 2.5 percent flat annual target, while also paving the way for the sustainable recovery of lending supportive of balanced and lasting economic growth. The NBR Board reiterates that the adequate use of all tools available to the central bank amid a close monitoring of domestic and global economic developments will be conducive to achieving the primary objective of price stability over the medium term, as well as to ensuring financial stability. The consistent implementation of the macroeconomic policy mix and structural reforms agreed under the external financing arrangements signed with the international institutions, along with balanced social and political developments during the election year 2014, is key to consolidating the stability of the domestic economy and enhancing its resilience to external shocks. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 6 May 2014, when the new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
India,2014-04-01,"First Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2014-15 Press Statement by the Governor ""Good morning and welcome to the Reserve Bank. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, we have decided today to keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.0 per cent. We have also decided to increase the liquidity provided under 7-day and 14-day term repos from 0.5 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of the banking system to 0.75 per cent, and decrease the liquidity provided under overnight repos under the LAF from 0.5 per cent of bank-wise NDTL to 0.25 per cent with immediate effect. Let me turn to the rationale. Real GDP growth is projected to pick up from a little below 5 per cent in 2013-14 to a range of 5 to 6 per cent in 2014-15 albeit with downside risks to the central estimate of 5.5 per cent. Easing of domestic supply bottlenecks and progress on the implementation of stalled projects already cleared should contribute to growth, as will stronger anticipated export growth as the world economy picks up. For the year as a whole, the CAD is expected to be about 2.0 per cent of GDP. Sustained inflows, augmented by repayments by public sector oil marketing companies of their foreign currency obligations to the Reserve Bank during March, have led to an increase in reserves. Looking ahead, vegetable prices have entered their seasonal trough and further softening is unlikely. There are also risks to our central forecast of 8 per cent CPI inflation by January 2015. These include a less-than-normal monsoon due to possible el nino effects; uncertainty on the setting of minimum support prices for agricultural commodities and the setting of other administered prices, especially of fuel, fertilizer and electricity; the outlook for fiscal policy; geo-political developments and their impact on international commodity prices. There will also be a downward statistical pull on CPI inflation later this year, due to base effects from high inflation during June-November 2013. It is critical to look through any transient effects, including these base effects, which could temporarily soften or harden headline inflation during 2014. Our policy stance is firmly focused on keeping the economy on a disinflationary glide path that is intended to hit 8 per cent CPI inflation by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016. At the current juncture, it is appropriate to hold the policy rate, while allowing the rate increases undertaken during September 2013 through January 2014 to work their way through the economy. Furthermore, if inflation continues along the intended glide path, further policy tightening in the near term is not anticipated at this juncture.2 In pursuance of the Dr.Urjit R. Patel Committee's recommendation to de- emphasise overnight “guaranteed-access” windows for liquidity management and progressively conduct liquidity management through term repos, we have decided to further reduce access to overnight repos under the LAF while compensating fully with a commensurate expansion of the market's access to term repos from the Reserve Bank. The primary objective is to improve the transmission of policy impulses across the interest rate spectrum. Developmental and Regulatory Policies We have set out a five-pillar framework to guide the developmental and regulatory policies of the Reserve Bank. I invite you all to go through Part B of the Policy Statement which lays out the developmental and regulatory measures, the progress made and some new initiatives that are being undertaken. Let me highlight a few. Some recommendations of Dr.Urjit R. Patel Committee report have been implemented including adoption of the new CPI (combined) as the key measure of inflation, explicit recognition of the glide path for disinflation, transition to a bi-monthly monetary policy cycle, progressive reduction in access to overnight liquidity under the LAF at the fixed repo rate and a corresponding increase in access to liquidity through term repos, and introduction of longer tenor term repos as well as, going forward, term reverse repos. Following on the recommendations of the High Level Advisory Committee chaired by Dr.Bimal Jalan, and after consulting the Election Commission, the RBI will announce in-principle approval for new bank licenses. Immediately after, and using the learning from the licensing exercise as well as building on its previously-released discussion paper on banking structure, the Reserve Bank will work to giving licenses more regularly, that is virtually “on-tap”. It will also set out categories of differentiated bank licenses that will allow a wider pool of entrants into banking. Turning to markets To expand investor demand for Inflation Indexed Bonds, design changes improving their attractiveness to the general public are being worked out. In order to expand the market for corporate bonds, banks will be allowed to offer partial credit enhancements to them. The feasibility of limited re-repo/re-hypothecation of “repoed” government securities is being explored. As regards foreign investors, the Reserve Bank welcomes them and will continue to work to ease entry costs while reducing risk for investors and the volatility of flows. Towards this end Modalities allowing Foreign Portfolio Investors to hedge their currency risks through exchange traded currency futures are being worked out in consultation with SEBI. FPIs will be allowed to hedge their coupon receipts falling due during next 12 months. KYC norms are being simplified for Foreign Portfolio Investors.3 To encourage longer-term flows and reduce volatility. FPI investments in G- Secs will henceforth be permitted only in dated securities of maturity one year and above, and existing investment in T-bills will be allowed to taper off on maturity/sale. Any investment limits vacated at the shorter end will be available at longer maturities, so overall FPI limits will not be diminished. Turning to inclusion and customer protection. To enlarge the Banking Correspondent (BC) base, the inclusion of new entities, as well as a relaxation of existing distance restrictions, is being considered. A number of measures to protect consumers are being envisaged. For example. Banks should not levy penal charges for non-maintenance of minimum balance in ordinary savings bank account and inoperative accounts, but instead curtail the services accorded those accounts until the balance is restored. Finally, to tackle distress in the system The comprehensive framework to help banks reduce their NPAs even while putting distressed projects back on track will be effective from today. We will monitor progress and make any needed adjustments to ensure it operates smoothly. Finally. I hope the only thing that was surprising about monetary policy today was the lack of surprise. I am glad financial markets and analysts have started understanding what we are doing. Thank you for your attention"". Alpana Killawala Press Release : 2013-2014/1927 Principal Chief General Manager. First Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2014-15 By Dr.Raghuram G. Rajan. Governor Part A: Monetary Policy Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.0 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liability (NDTL); and increase the liquidity provided under 7-day and 14-day term repos from 0.5 per cent of NDTL of the banking system to 0.75 per cent, and decrease the liquidity provided under overnight repos under the LAF from 0.5 per cent of bank-wise NDTL to 0.25 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 9.0 per cent. Assessment 2. Since the Third Quarter Review of January 2014, global activity appears to have moderated on slower growth in the US, the UK and Japan, continuing sluggishness in the Euro area and a subdued pick-up in emerging and developing economies, restrained by the uncertain external demand environment as well as by localised cyclical and structural constraints. For a number of emerging markets, further tightening of external financing conditions and renewed volatility of capital flows are the biggest risks to their outlook. Going forward, global growth is likely to strengthen in the rest of the year, with risks tilted to the downside. Domestically, real GDP growth continued to be modest in Q3 of 2013-14, with some strengthening of activity in services such as trade, hotels, transport and communication, and financing, real estate and business services. Despite some positive movement in more recent data, industrial activity continues to be a drag on the economy, with retrenchment in both consumption and investment demand reflected in the contraction of output of consumer durables as well as capital goods. In the quarters ahead, the boost provided by robust agricultural production in 2013 may wane. Moreover, the outlook for the 2014 south-west monsoon appears uncertain. Sluggishness in industrial activity, exports and several categories of services underlines the need to revitalise productivity and competitiveness.2 4. Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) moderated for the third month in succession in February 2014, driven lower by the sharp disinflation in food prices, although prices of fruits, milk and products have started to firm up. Excluding food and fuel, however, retail inflation remained sticky at around 8 per cent. This suggests that some demand pressures are still at play. The merchandise trade deficit was 22 per cent lower in April-February 2013-14 than its level a year ago, due to the large decline in non-oil imports. The steady narrowing of the trade deficit over the year has shrunk the current account deficit (CAD) to 0.9 per cent of GDP in Q3 of 2013-14. For the year as a whole, the CAD is expected to be about 2.0 per cent of GDP. Most recently, however, export growth has slowed, partly because of slowdown in demand in partner countries as well as a softening of prices of exports of petroleum products and gems and jewellery (offset by a reduction in the prices of oil and gold imports). Whether the export slowdown persists as global growth picks up once again remains to be seen. In February, there was a turnaround in portfolio flows as investors largely priced in the effects of taper by the US Fed and responded to economic and geo-political developments in emerging markets with re-allocations. With sustained inflows in the form of portfolio flows, foreign direct investment (FDI) and external commercial borrowings, external financing conditions turned comfortable. Inflows, augmented by repayments by public sector oil marketing companies of their foreign currency obligations to the Reserve Bank during March, have led to an increase in reserves. Turning to liquidity, envisaging pressures from large currency demand and tax outflows from mid-March, a 21-day term repo of 500 billion was conducted on March 14 and 7-day term repo auctions of 100 billion on March 19 and 26, in addition to the regular 14-day term repo of 400 billion on March 21. A 5-day term repo for a notified amount of 200 billion was conducted on March 28 to facilitate non-disruptive banking operations during the annual closing of accounts. Access to the MSF on March 29 and 31 (holidays) was also allowed for this purpose. The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor the liquidity conditions and actively manage liquidity to ensure adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors. Policy Stance and Rationale 7. Since December 2013, the sharper than expected disinflation in vegetable prices has enabled a sizable fall in headline inflation. Looking ahead, vegetable prices have entered their seasonal trough and further softening is unlikely. Meanwhile. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has remained flat. There are risks to the central forecast of 8 per cent CPI inflation by January 2015 stemming from a less-than-normal monsoon due to possible el nino effects; uncertainty on the setting of minimum support prices for agricultural commodities and the setting of other administered prices, especially of fuel, fertiliser and electricity; the outlook for fiscal policy; geo-political developments and their impact on international commodity prices. There will also be a downward statistical pull on CPI inflation exerted by base effects of high inflation during June-November 2013. It is critical to look through any transient effects, including these base effects, which could temporarily soften headline inflation during 2014 (Chart 1).3 9. The Reserve Bank's policy stance will be firmly focussed on keeping the economy on a disinflationary glide path that is intended to hit 8 per cent CPI inflation by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016. At the current juncture, it is appropriate to hold the policy rate, while allowing the rate increases undertaken during September 2013-January 2014 to work their way through the economy. Furthermore, if inflation continues along the intended glide path, further policy tightening in the near term is not anticipated at this juncture. Contingent upon the desired inflation outcome, real GDP growth is projected to pick up from a little below 5 per cent in 2013-14 to a range of 5 to 6 per cent in 2014-15 albeit with downside risks to the central estimate of 5.5 per cent (Chart 2). Lead indicators do not point to any sustained revival in industry and services as yet, and the outlook for the agricultural sector is contingent upon the timely arrival and spread of the monsoon. Easing of domestic supply bottlenecks and progress on the implementation of stalled projects already cleared should brighten up the growth outlook, as would stronger anticipated export growth as the world economy picks up. In pursuance of the Dr.Urjit R. Patel Committee's recommendation to de- emphasise overnight “guaranteed-access” windows for liquidity management and progressively conduct liquidity management through term repos, the Reserve Bank has decided to further reduce access to overnight repos under the LAF while4 compensating fully with a commensurate expansion of the market's access to term repos from the Reserve Bank. The primary objective is to improve the transmission of policy impulses across the interest rate spectrum. The term repo has evolved as a useful indicator of underlying liquidity conditions. It also allows market participants to hold liquidity for a longer period, thereby providing the impetus for engaging in term transactions in the market, evolving market-based benchmarks for pricing various financial products and also improving efficiency in cash/treasury management. Liquidity conditions have tightened in March, partly on account of year-end ‘window dressing' by banks, though an extraordinary infusion of liquidity by the Reserve Bank has mitigated the tightness. The Reserve Bank will propose measures to reduce such practices. The second bi-monthly monetary policy statement is scheduled on Tuesday. June 3, 2014. Part B: Developmental and Regulatory Policies 14. This part of the Statement reviews the progress on various developmental and regulatory policy measures announced by the Reserve Bank in recent policy statements and also sets out new measures. In the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2013-14 announced in October 2013, the Reserve Bank set out a five-pillar framework to guide its developmental and regulatory measures. Noteworthy progress has since been made in implementing measures within this framework. Some of the recommendations of the Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework (Chairman: Dr.Urjit R. Patel) have been implemented including adoption of the new CPI (combined) as the key measure of inflation, explicit recognition of the glide path for disinflation, transition to a bi-monthly monetary policy cycle, progressive reduction in access to overnight liquidity under the LAF at the fixed repo rate and corresponding increase in access to liquidity through term repos, and introduction of longer tenor term repos. On strengthening banking structure, which is the second pillar, the High Level Advisory Committee (Chairman: Dr.Bimal Jalan) has recently submitted its recommendations to the Reserve Bank on the licensing of new banks. The Reserve Bank will announce in-principle approval for new licences after consulting with the Election Commission. Immediately afterwards, the Reserve Bank will start working on the framework for on-tap licensing as well as differentiated bank licences, building on the Discussion Paper on “Banking Structure in India – The Way Forward” placed on the Reserve Bank's website in August 2013 and using the learning from the recent licensing process. The intent is to expand the variety and efficiency of players in the banking system while maintaining financial stability. The Reserve Bank will also be open to banking mergers, provided competition and stability are not compromised. Progress has been made on a number of regulatory and supervisory measures. Based on the comments/feedback received on the draft framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs), the final framework is proposed to be issued by end-May 2014. As the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) stipulated by the Basel Committee becomes a standard with effect from January 1, 2015 it is proposed to issue guidelines relating to Basel III LCR and Liquidity Risk Monitoring tools by end-May 2014. Updated guidelines on stress testing, drawing from Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) principles and subsequent global developments, were issued in December 2013. Capital and provisioning requirements on banks' advances to corporates with unhedged foreign currency exposures were specified in January 2014. The draft report of the Internal Working5 Group (Chairman: Shri B. Mahapatra), which was constituted to operationalise the countercyclical capital buffer framework in India, was placed on the Reserve Bank's website for comments in December 2013. On the basis of the recommendations of the Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low Income Households (Chairman: Dr.Nachiket Mor) to encourage banks to actively manage their exposures to various sectors, including priority sectors, it is proposed to prescribe certain additional disclosure requirements in the financial statements by end-June 2014. Following industry-wide concerns about asset quality and the consequential impact on the performance/profitability of banks, the Reserve Bank has extended the transitional period for full implementation of Basel III Capital Regulations in India up to March 31, 2019, instead of as on March 31, 2018. This will also align full implementation of Basel III in India closer to the internationally agreed date of January 1, 2019. The Reserve Bank has moved over to risk-based supervision (RBS) for scheduled commercial banks (SCBs), starting with banks that were more prepared. Based on the experience gained from the completion of Phase I and the feedback received on the RBS framework from banks, the framework is being fine-tuned. Banks are also being advised to assess their risk management architecture, practices, related processes and management information systems (MIS) to facilitate their switch over to RBS in Phase II. As regards the third pillar on the broadening and deepening of financial markets. Inflation Indexed National Saving Securities (IINSSs) for retail investors were issued in December 2013. To expand investor demand, certain design changes are required. Some such as an increase in the limit for individual investors and trusts have been implemented. Others such as tradability (and consequently, the benefit of indexation for capital gains tax) and issuance of securities with regular coupon flows are being contemplated. Cash settled single bond 10 year Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) were introduced by stock exchanges in January 2014. The Reserve Bank will shortly issue guidelines that would allow banks to offer partial credit enhancements to corporate bonds. As recommended by the Working Group on Enhancing Liquidity in the Government Securities and Interest Rate Derivatives Markets (Chairman: Shri R. Gandhi), the Reserve Bank proposes to introduce a market making scheme for primary dealers (PDs) by allocating specific securities to PDs and ensuring continuous availability of prices, with a suitable framework for assessing the performance of PDs. It will also examine the possibility of limited re-repo/re- hypothecation of ""repoed"" government securities, subject to appropriate risk control measures. The Committee on Financial Benchmarks (Chairman: Shri P. Vijaya Bhaskar) submitted its report in February 2014. The Committee has recommended several measures/principles to be adopted in respect of major Indian rupee interest rate and foreign exchange benchmarks to strengthen their quality, the methodology by which they are set and the governance framework. Banks and PDs are being advised to strengthen their governance frameworks on benchmark submissions, subject to the supervisory review of the Reserve Bank. Other recommendations will be implemented in consultation with the Fixed Income. Money Market and Derivatives Association (FIMMDA) and Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India (FEDAI). The Reserve Bank will continue to work to ease entry while reducing risk to foreign investors from the volatility of flows. The modalities for allowing FIIs to hedge their currency risk by using exchange traded currency futures in the domestic exchanges are being finalised in consultation with the Securities and Exchange6 Board of India (SEBI). In order to enhance hedging facilities for foreign investors in debt instruments, it is proposed to allow them to hedge the coupon receipts falling due during the next 12 months. Rebooking of cancelled contracts in case of contracted exposures has been fully restored. It is further proposed to allow all resident individuals, firms and companies with actual foreign exchange exposures to book foreign exchange derivative contracts up to US$ 250,000 on declaration, subject to certain conditions. Revised regulations under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) for a simplified foreign portfolio investor (FPI) regime have been notified in March 2014. The Reserve Bank also proposes to simplify the know-your-customer (KYC) procedures for opening bank accounts by FPIs. The Reserve Bank has also been rationalising and expanding limits for FPI investments in debt markets. To encourage longer maturity flows, investment limits in Treasury Bills were capped at US$ 5.5 billion in April 2013, even while the limit for long-term investors was increased by US$ 5 billion in June 2013. As a further step towards encouraging longer-term flows, investments by FPIs in G-Secs shall henceforth be permitted only in dated securities of residual maturity of one year and above, and existing investment in Treasury Bills will be allowed to taper off on maturity/sale. The overall limit for FPI investment in G- Secs will, however, remain unchanged at US$ 30 billion, so the investment limits vacated at the shorter end will be available at longer maturities. As regards foreign direct investment (FDI), it has been decided to withdraw all the existing guidelines relating to valuation in case of any acquisition/sale of shares and accordingly, such transactions will henceforth be based on acceptable market practices. Operating guidelines will be notified separately. A comprehensive IT-based system namely. Export Data Processing and Monitoring System (EDPMS) for effective monitoring, easier tracking and reconciliation of export transactions was launched in February 2014. The data will be shared among the stakeholders/agencies involved, and will allow more timely and detailed information on exports as well as prevention of export-related fraud. On financial inclusion, the fourth pillar, the recommendations of the Mor Committee on accelerating the flow of credit to those at the bottom of the pyramid and enlargement of catchment area of the Business Correspondents (BCs), including through possible inclusion of new entities as BCs, are under examination. To overcome the challenge of cash management of BCs which is impeding the scaling up of the BC model, the Reserve Bank will collate best practices and issue a fresh set of guidelines to commercial banks. The Reserve Bank has released a concept paper on Trade Receivables and Credit Exchange for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in March 2014 on its website for public feedback. The model outlined in the paper envisages a credit exchange with both primary and secondary market segments that will help address problems faced by the MSME segment on delayed payments and dependency on their corporate buyers. After receiving feedback, the Reserve Bank will work towards implementation. With a view to ensuring fair and transparent credit pricing and to give a fillip to the flow of credit to micro and small enterprises (MSEs) borrowers, it would be desirable for SCBs to provide differential interest rates for MSEs and other borrowers whose loans are covered under the credit guarantee scheme. SCBs are encouraged to undertake a review of their loan policy governing extension of credit facilities to the MSE sector and should consider using Board approved credit scoring models in their evaluation of the loan proposals of MSE borrowers.7 29. Measures have been taken to expand banking services to the financially excluded sections of society with the appropriate application of technology. The GIRO Advisory Group (GAG) has recommended a tiered structure approach for a centralised bill payment system that will enable inter-operability viz., (a) Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) and (b) Bharat Bill Payment Operating Units (BBPOUs). The recommendations of the GAG report are under examination. A Technical Committee (Chairman: Shri B. Sambamurthy) set up to examine the challenges being faced by banks in taking mobile banking forward for achieving financial inclusion submitted its report in January 2014. This was placed in the public domain for feedback. The recommendations of the Committee will be examined closely, and plans for the way forward will be discussed with stakeholders. Consumer protection is an integral aspect of financial inclusion. The Reserve Bank proposes to frame comprehensive consumer protection regulations based on domestic experience and global best practices. In the interest of their consumers, banks should consider allowing their borrowers the possibility of prepaying floating rate term loans without any penalty. Banks should also not take undue advantage of customer difficulty or inattention. Instead of levying penal charges for non- maintenance of minimum balance in ordinary savings bank accounts, banks should limit services available on such accounts to those available to Basic Savings Bank Deposit Accounts and restore the services when the balances improve to the minimum required level. Banks should not levy penal charges for non-maintenance of minimum balances in any inoperative account. Banks should also limit the liability of customers in electronic banking transactions in cases where banks are not able to prove customer negligence. Under the fifth pillar, on improving the system's ability to deal with corporate distress and financial institution distress by strengthening real and financial restructuring as well as debt recovery, the Reserve Bank issued a framework for revitalising distressed assets in the economy in January 2014. The framework lays down guidelines for early recognition of financial distress, steps for prompt resolution and fair recovery for lenders. It envisages centralised reporting and dissemination of information on large credits, early formation of lenders' forums and incentives for lenders and borrowers to agree on resolution and disincentives for both in the event of failure to act in a timely way. Improvements in the current restructuring process such as an independent evaluation of large value restructuring with a focus on viability and fair sharing of gains and losses between promoters and creditors have been mandated. Finally, a more liberal regulatory treatment of distressed asset sales, particularly to asset reconstruction companies, has been provided. The framework will be fully effective from today. Following the announcement in the Second Quarter Review of October 30, 2013, a Working Group (Chairmen: Dr.Arvind Mayaram and Shri Anand Sinha) on a Resolution Regime for Financial Institutions was constituted, which submitted its report in January 2014. The Group has, inter alia, recommended the setting up of a single Financial Resolution Authority (FRA), an early supervisory intervention mechanism in the form of prompt corrective action (PCA) framework for all financial institutions and a separate comprehensive legal framework providing necessary powers and tools for orderly resolution of all financial institutions irrespective of ownership. The Group's report will be disseminated for comments. An overhaul of the extant regulatory framework for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) is underway to align it with several important developments which have taken place in the financial sector. It is, therefore, proposed to keep in abeyance, subject to certain exceptions, issue of Certificate of Registration (CoR) for conducting NBFC business, except in the public interest, till an appropriate regulatory8 framework is put in place for the NBFC sector. Detailed notification will be issued separately. Going forward, this five-pillar approach will continue to guide the design and calibration of developmental measures. With competition in the banking sector set to increase, financial markets will play a complementary role, allowing banks to trade their long term assets and match the maturity profile of assets and liabilities. Simultaneously, the Reserve Bank will strive to increase the reach of financial services to everyone, however remote or small, by using technology, new products, and new entities to link people up to the formal financial system. Priority sector lending will become an effective vehicle to promote greater financial access. Concomitantly, the Reserve Bank will take steps for early recognition and resolution of distress with a focus on putting real assets back to work in their best use.

Euroarea,2014-04-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Rehn. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Incoming information confirms that the moderate recovery of the euro area economy is proceeding in line with our previous assessment. At the same time, recent information remains consistent with our expectation of a prolonged period of low inflation followed by a gradual upward movement in HICP inflation rates. The signals from the monetary analysis confirm the picture of subdued underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term. Inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Looking ahead, we will monitor developments very closely and will consider all instruments available to us. We are resolute in our determination to maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation and to act swiftly if required. Hence, we do not exclude further monetary policy easing and we firmly reiterate that we continue to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation is based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy, the high degree of unutilised capacity and subdued money and credit creation. At the same time, we are closely following developments on money markets. The Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments within its mandate in order to cope effectively with risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP in the euro area rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the last quarter of 2013, after 0.1% and 0.3% in the previous two quarters respectively. Survey data that encompass the first quarter of this year are consistent with continued moderate growth, confirming previous expectations that the ongoing recovery is increasingly supported by firmer domestic demand. Looking ahead, some further improvement in domestic demand should materialise, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance, ongoing improvements in financing conditions working their way through to the real economy, and the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. In addition, real incomes are supported by moderate price developments, in particular lower energy prices. Economic activity is also expected to benefit from a gradual strengthening of demand for euro area exports. At the same time, although labour markets have shown the first signs of improvement, unemployment in the euro area remains high and, overall, unutilised capacity is sizeable. Moreover, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on the pace of the economic recovery. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. Developments in global financial markets and in emerging market economies, as well as geopolitical risks, may have the potential to affect economic conditions negatively. Other downside risks include weaker than expected domestic demand and insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries, as well as weaker export growth. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.5% in March 2014, down from 0.7% in February. The decrease reflects falls in the annual rates of change of the food, goods and services components, partly offset by a more moderate decline in energy prices. On the basis of current exchange rates and prevailing futures prices for energy, annual HICP inflation is expected to pick up somewhat in April, partly related to the volatility of service prices in the months around Easter. Over the following months, annual HICP inflation is expected to remain low, before gradually increasing during 2015 to reach levels closer to 2% towards the end of 2016. At the same time, medium to long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. The Governing Council sees both upside and downside risks to the outlook for price developments as limited and broadly balanced over the medium term. In this context, the possible repercussions of both geopolitical risks and exchange rate developments will be monitored closely. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for February 2014 point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (M3). Annual growth in M3 was broadly stable in February at 1.3%, compared with 1.2% in January. The growth of the narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained robust at 6.2% in February, after 6.1% in January. The main factor supporting annual M3 growth continued to be the increase in the MFI net external asset position, reflecting the keen interest of international investors in euro area assets. MFI loans to the private sector continued to decline in February. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -3.1%, compared with -2.8% in January. Weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.4% in February 2014, still broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. Since the summer of 2012, substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks. In order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. This is the objective of the ongoing comprehensive assessment by the ECB. To sum up, the economic analysis confirms our expectation of a prolonged period of low inflation followed by a gradual upward movement in HICP inflation rates towards levels closer to 2%. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms the picture of subdued underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term. As regards fiscal policies, euro area countries have made important progress in correcting fiscal imbalances. They should not unravel past consolidation achievements and should put high government debt ratios on a downward trajectory over the medium term, in line with the Stability and Growth Pact. Fiscal strategies should ensure a growth-friendly composition of consolidation to achieve better quality and more efficient public services, while minimising the distortionary effects of taxation. Further decisive steps are needed to reform product and labour markets with a view to improving competitiveness, raising potential growth, generating employment opportunities and making euro area economies more flexible."
Poland,2014-04-09,"Warsaw, 9 April 2014 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 8-9 April 2014 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 2.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 4.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis;  bill rediscount rate at 2.75% on an annual basis. Growth in global economic activity remains moderate, although the economic situation varies across countries. In the United States economic conditions are relatively favourable, while the euro area has been experiencing a slow, yet somewhat limited recovery. In the largest emerging economies activity growth remains low in comparison with their previous performance, while in China there are signs of its weakening. Moderate growth in global economic activity is conducive to maintaining low inflation in many countries. Data on domestic economic activity confirm a continuation of the gradual recovery in Poland. In the first months of 2014 industrial output and retail sales growth accelerated. In February construction and assembly output increased as well. Activity growth in the subsequent quarters is signalled by favourable business climate indicators. The recovery is gradually being transmitted into labour market conditions. Signs of employment growth in the enterprise sector, as well as a decline in unemployment, have been observed. However, despite a slight fall in February, the unemployment rate remains at an elevated level, which restricts wage growth. In February 2014 CPI inflation amounted to 0.7%, thus remaining markedly below the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. Core inflation also continued at a low level. At the same, time producer prices declined further. This was accompanied by low inflation expectations. Lending growth to the private sector  while accelerating slightly  remains limited. However, the modest increase in mortgage loans and the further gradual revival in consumer loans starts to be also accompanied by a recovery in lending to enterprises. In the opinion of the Council, gradual economic recovery is likely to continue in the coming quarters, however, inflationary pressures will remain subdued. Therefore, the Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged. In the Council's assessment NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged for a longer period of time, i.e. at least until the end of the third quarter of 2014. 1/2 In the opinion of the Council, lowering interest rates in the first half of 2013 and keeping them unchanged in subsequent quarters, supports recovery of the domestic economy, gradual return of inflation to the target and stabilisation in the financial markets."
South Korea,2014-04-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to have continued to ease, while economic growth trends in some emerging market countries have weakened somewhat. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance and by the weakening of economic growth in emerging market countries. In Korea indicators related to domestic demand have slumped temporarily, but as exports have shown buoyancy the Committee appraises the economic recovery to have continued in line with the trend of growth. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has continued its substantial uptrend, led by increases in the 50- and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for the time being going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will gradually narrow. Consumer price inflation rose from 1.0% the previous month to 1.3% in March, due mainly to expansions in the extents of increase in service fees and livestock product prices. Core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products also rose from 1.7% to 2.1%. The Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, although it will remain low for the time being due largely to a bountiful agricultural harvest. Regarding the housing market, the uptrends of sales and leasehold deposit prices in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and in the rest of the country increased slightly, due in part to the influence of the spring moving season. In the domestic financial markets, stock prices had fallen, due mainly to concerns about an economic slowdown in China, but have since then shifted to a rise in line chiefly with the continuation of improvements in US economic activity. The Korean won had weakened against the US dollar but has since appreciated considerably, influenced mainly by in- and outflows of foreigners' portfolio investment funds. Long-term market interest rates have meanwhile moved within a relatively narrow range. Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and the influences of external risk factors such as shifts in major countries' monetary policies, the weakening of economic growth trends in some emerging market countries and geopolitical risks in Eastern Europe, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while supporting the continued recovery of economic growth."
Ukraine,2014-04-14,"Having analyzed the behavior of macroeconomic and monetary indicators in the January to April period, the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine pointed to the tense situation in Ukraine's money market resulting from the worsening of economic agents' market expectations amid social and political tensions. Under complicated macroeconomic conditions, it poses risks to price stability, the maintenance whereof being a top priority for the National Bank of Ukraine in accordance with the applicable law. Inflation has been growing at a faster pace over the past few months. In particular, annual CPI inflation picked up to 3.4% in March versus 1.2% in February 2014. At the same time, there are risks of a further upward spiral in inflation as a result of a decline in the exchange rate of the hryvnia and the implementation of economic reforms announced by the Ukrainian Government. In order to curb inflation and redress imbalances built up in the money market, the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine considers it necessary to take measures to raise the intrinsic value of the national monetary unit by enhancing efficiency of the interest rate pass-through. Coupled with other stabilisation measures taken by the National Bank of Ukraine, it will make deposits more attractive and have a positive impact on Ukraine's foreign exchange market conditions. At the same time, the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine considers it expedient to mitigate the impact of changes in the interest rate policy on the cost of the mechanism designed to provide immediate liquidity support to banks, which has recently been adopted by the National Bank of Ukraine, given the fact that presently its nominal level is within the bounds of market value of resources. In view of the above, on April 14, 2014, the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine passed Resolution No. 212, which envisage the following:. Discount rate should be set at 9.5% (effective from April 15, 2014). The discount rate was last changed on August 13, 2013 when it was set at 6.5% per annum;. the interest rate on refinancing loans granted by the central bank through the mechanism designed to provide immediate liquidity support to banks should be set at the level twice the value of the discount rate. It was previously set at the level three times the value of the discount rate. Commenting on the Resolution passed by the National Bank of Ukraine Board. Director of General Department of Monetary Policy Olena Shcherbakova expressed confidence that, coupled with other measures taken by the regulator, it would help stabilize the situation in the market. “Ukraine has wide experience of handling the situation in the money market in challenging conditions. This indicates that under these conditions the most appropriate option is to achieve two goals. The first goal is to provide the maximum liquidity support to banks so that they are able to meet their obligations. The second goal is to raise the value of the monetary unit, among other things, through the interest rate pass-through, which keeps the speculative demand for resources down and helps revive banks' funding base,"" noted Ms Olena Shcherbakova. According to her, this plan of action will help ensure the normal operation of the banking system, and maintain price stability. “The funds that households have withdrawn from bank accounts could put upward pressure on consumer prices,” added Ms Olena Shcherbakova. The discount rate is the base rate for the National Bank of Ukraine's other rates and the rate at which resources are offered through the liquidity-providing tenders. The discount rate serves as a benchmark for measuring the price of money. By changing the discount rate the National Bank of Ukraine sends a signal to market participants about the stance of the monetary policy and signals that it is resolute in its efforts to exercise its main function in ensuring the hryvnia stability."
Peru,2014-04-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2014 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.0 percent. This level of the reference rate is compatible with an inflation forecast converging to 2 percent in the 2014-2015 horizon and takes into account that: inflation expectations remain anchored within the inflation target range; GDP has been recording lower growth rates than the country's potential level of growth; recent indicators show mixed signals of recovery in the world economy, and the supply factors that led inflation to increase are becoming more moderate. Inflation in March registered a rate of 0.52 percent and thus inflation in the last 12 months fell from 3.78 percent in February to 3.38 percent in March. The rate of inflation without food and energy was 0.78 percent as a result of which the rate of inflation in the last 12 months declined from 2.96 to 2.78 percent. Inflation is forecast to remain initially close to the upper band of the target range due to the lagging effect of the supply shocks and to converge thereafter to the 2 percent target. Indicators of activity and the surveys on macroeconomic expectations point to a growth of economic activity in the first semester of this year, although at a lower rate than expected. The BCRP has continued lowering the rate of reserve requirements in domestic currency, reducing the rate from 12.5 to 12 percent in April with the purpose of supporting the dynamism of credit in soles. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants and, if necessary, will implement additional measures to ease its monetary policy instruments. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to reduce the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 2.80 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for May on its meeting of May 8, 2014."
Chile,2014-04-17,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 17 April 2014 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 4.0% (annual). Internationally, incoming information confirms the outlook of recovery of the developed economies. Projections of moderate growth in emerging markets remain, which is relevant for the prices of copper and other metals. Agricultural and fuel prices picked up since the last meeting. Inflation in the developed world has remained subdued, so a slow normalization of their monetary policies is foreseen. International financial conditions showed some improvement in the last month and the dollar depreciated globally. Local economic indicators confirm the low dynamism of output and demand, in line with the baseline scenario of March's Monetary Policy Report. Annual CPI inflation has risen to 3.5%, influenced by higher prices of foodstuffs and fuels, together with the depreciation of the peso. Inflation expectations remain around 3% in the relevant monetary policy horizon. The Board will consider the possibility of making additional cuts to the policy rate in line with the evolution of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions and its implications on the inflationary outlook. At the same time, the Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Turkiye,2014-04-24,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 12 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been kept at 11.5 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 8 percent. b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 10 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, while lending rate has been reduced from 15 percent to 13.5 percent. The Committee assessed that the strong and frontloaded monetary tightening delivered at the January interim meeting has contained the adverse impact of upside risks on the medium term inflation expectations. Inflation expectations and pricing behavior will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. Recent decline in uncertainties and partial improvement in the risk premium indicators have reduced the need for an additional tightening in liquidity policy. Accordingly, the Committee decided to deliver a technical cut in the late liquidity window lending interest rate. Loan growth continues to slow down in response to the tight monetary policy stance and recent macroprudential measures. In line with these developments, the data regarding the first quarter of 2014 indicate some deceleration in private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, with the help of the recovery in foreign demand, the contribution of net exports to economic growth is expected to increase. The Committee expects that such a demand composition will support disinflation and lead to a significant improvement in the current account deficit in 2014. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Russia,2014-04-25,"On 25 April 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to raisethe key rate to 7.5 percent per annum due to higher inflation risks. The probability of inflation exceeding the 5.0% target at the end of 2014 has increased substantially. This has been caused by more pronounced than expected pass-through effect of the exchange rate dynamics on consumer prices, the rise in inflation expectations, as well as unfavourable conditions in the markets for some goods. The Bank of Russia does not intend to lower the key rate in the coming months. The Bank of Russia estimates that the adopted decision would ensure the decline in inflation to no more than 6.0% by the end of 2014. In March - April 2014, the year-on-year consumer price growth rate rose and stood at 7.2% as of 21 April 2014. Weekly inflation has persisted at 0.2%. Inflation acceleration has been mainly caused by the larger than expected impact of exchange rate dynamics. Unfavourable conditions in the markets for some goods, such as dairy products, sugar, pork, and petrol, also have contributed to higher inflation rates. Some additional inflationary pressure has come from a temporary surge in consumer demand for non-food goods amid the rise of inflation expectations. As a result, there was the increase in prices for a wide range of goods, including domestically produced goods, as well as services. In March 2014, core inflation accelerated to 6.0% from 5.6% in February. The current economic slowdown is predominantly structural by nature and thus does not exert any noticeable downward pressure on inflation. Historically low unemployment rate constrains economic growth potential. Due to demographic trends the impact of this factor will persist in the long run. Utilisation of commercially viable production capacity remains relatively high. Labour productivity growth is sluggish, while fixed capital investment continues to contract because of declining profits in the real sector, limited access to long-term financing in both international and domestic markets, as well as low producer and consumer confidence. Uncertainty about international political situation also hampers production and investment. Besides, weak economic activity in most countries, which are Russia's trading partners, restrains the economic growth of Russia. At the same time, persistently high oil prices have a stabilising effect on the domestic economy and public finance. In March - April 2014, household rouble deposit rates began to grow. This was caused by the conversion of funds to foreign currency due to higher inflation expectations and by increasing bank funding costs, inter alia, as a result of the Bank of Russia's decision to raise the key rate in March 2014. In addition, banks tighten lending conditions, in particular, by increasing loan rates. At the same time, weak economic activity restrains demand for loans and respectively curbs a rise of interest rates on loans. According to the Bank of Russia projections, a year of 2014 will continue to witness a downward trend in economic growth. Boost to economy from the observed rouble depreciation will be limited. Amid economic uncertainty and declining producer confidence there is a strong probability of a reduction in fixed capital investment. Combination of slower growth in real wages and a decline in household lending growth rates will have a dampening effect on consumer activity. Inflation will stay around the current level until the mid-2014. In the second half of the year, consumer price growth will decelerate as a result of lower planned hikes in administered prices and tariffs, falling inflation expectations, and the aggregate output of goods and services remaining below potential. Since monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, the probability of inflation exceeding the 5.0% target at end-2014 has increased substantially. The adopted decision on the key rate would ensure the decline in inflation to no more than 6.0% by the end of 2014 and help to maintain the appropriate balance of inflation risks and the risks of further economic slowdown. In the medium term the effect of factors behind the observed acceleration in consumer price growth will be exhausted and in the absence of any new shocks to the economy inflation will hit the target levels set in the Guidelines for the Single State Monetary Policy in 2014 and for 2015 and 2016. The next meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors on the key rate is scheduled for 16 June 2014. The press-release on the Bank of Russia Board of Directors' decision is to be published at 13:30. Moscow time. 1 Complete information on interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations is given in the TableInterest rates on the Bank of Russia operations. 2 A floating interest rate linked to the level of the Bank of Russia key rate. 3 Fine-tuning operations.

Egypt,2014-04-28,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release April 28, 2014 In its meeting held on April 28, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 825 percent, 925 percent, and 875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 875 percen. Headline CPI increased by 068 percent (m/m) in March compared to a decline of 103 percent (m/m) in February, bringing the annual rate to 982 percent in March up from 976 percent recorded in the previous mont. Monthly developments in headline inflation during 2014 Q1 were largely driven by higher prices of several food items in addition to a seasonal increase in prices of fruits and vegetable. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 070 percent (m/m) in March following an increase of 102 percent in February on the back of increases in food price. The annual rate increased to 990 percent in March up from 970 in Februar. Upside risks to the inflation outlook continue to be contained as the possibility of a sharp rebound in international food prices is unlikely in light of recent global development. Meanwhile real GDP picked up slightly in 2013/2014 Q2, growing by 14 percent compared to the 104 percent recorded in the quarter ending September 201. This brought the annual growth for the first half of 2013/2014 to a feeble 12 percent compared to the growth rate of 21 percent recorded in 2012/201. Economic activity remained sluggish in 2013/2014 Q2 on the back of modest growth rates in most of the key sectors, namely manufacturing and construction in addition to the contraction in the tourism and petroleum sector. In the meantime, investment levels remained low given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants since early 2011 and the weak credit growth to the private secto. Looking ahead, downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. The pronounced downside risks to domestic GDP combined with the negative output gap since 2011 will limit upside risks to the inflation outlook going forwar. Given the mixed balance of risks surrounding the inflation and the GDP outlooks at this juncture. MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat Sub Governor.

Israel,2014-04-28,"The CPI for the month of March increased by 0.3 percent, and inflation over the preceding 12 months was 1.3 percent. Inflation expectations for one year ahead remain within the target range, below the midpoint of the range. Data which became available this month indicate that in the first quarter there was some acceleration in the expansion of the economy, led by domestic demand and services exports, and with a virtual standstill in goods exports. Labor Force Survey data continue to indicate a decline in unemployment and an increase in employment. The number of employee posts of Israelis increased relatively sharply in January, primarily in domestic-market oriented industries, but there are no indications of wage increases, and the growth rate of health tax receipts remains moderate. In the past month, the shekel weakened by 0.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, while the effective exchange rate has remained stable for the year to date, and has appreciated by 4.5 percent over the past year. This month, the IMF slightly reduced its global growth and world trade volume forecasts, both by 0.1 percent, primarily against the background of a decline in the forecast for economic activity in emerging markets. Positive data were published in the US and Europe this month. In the US, the Fed is expected to only begin increasing the federal funds rate in the second half of 2015, and there are assessments that in Europe, additional accommodative monetary policy measures will be adopted. Emerging market economies remain weak. Home prices continued to increase this month, and their annual rate of increase is around 6-7 percent. The rate of mortgages taken out remains elevated, while there is stabilization, at a lower level, in the risk characteristics of new mortgages. There is continued uncertainty regarding the effect on price levels and activity volume of the policy measures whichwere decided upon. To view this press release as a Word document. Background conditions. As the Bank of Israel announced on April 10, 2014, the Monetary Committee has decided to bring forward the time of publication of the interest rate decision from 17:30 to 16:00, in order to enable those active in all markets to react to the interest rate decision, thereby creating symmetry among the various markets. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.3 percent in March, slightly above forecasters' projections for an increase of 0.2 percent, on average. The housing component increased notably, and there were marked declines in the clothing and footwear, and fruit and vegetables components. The rate of inflation over the preceding 12 monthswas 1.3 percent, compared with 1.2 percent over the 12 months ending in February. The change takes effect as of today. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Private forecasters' inflation projections for the next 12 CPI readings declined slightlythis month, to 1.5 percent on average. Inflation expectations derived fromthe capital market also declined slightly, to 1.5 percent, and expectations for the next 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates increased by 0.2 percentage points to 1.4 percent. Inflation expectations for medium and long terms did not change markedly this month, and remain slightly above the midpoint of the inflation target range. Based on private forecasters' projections, as well as the Telbor interest rates and the makam curve, no change in the Bank of Israel interest rateis expected in the coming months. Real economic activity: Data that became available this month indicate that in the first quarter there was some acceleration in the expansion of the economy, led by domestic demand and services exports, and with avirtual standstill in goods exports. In the third estimate of National Accounts data for the fourth quarter of 2013, the upward revision of GDP and business sector product continued. GDP growth was revised to 3.2 percent, and the business sector product growth rate was revised to 2.7 percent (seasonally adjusted, annual terms). Foreign trade data indicate that goods exports (excluding ships and aircraft and diamonds, seasonally adjusted) remained almost unchanged in the first quarter of the year, and excluding pharmaceuticals exports, which registered an atypical increase, goods exports declined by 6 percent in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. Services exports declined by 2.4 percent in February compared with January (seasonally adjusted data, excluding startups), but the average level in January-February was 8 percent greater than the monthly average in the fourth quarter. Goods imports (excluding ships, aircraft, diamonds and energy products, seasonally adjusted) increased by 2.6 percent in the first quarter, compared with the fourth quarter of last year, led by imports of consumer goods (4.4 percent) and raw materials (2.6 percent). Capital goods imports increased by only 0.6 percent, following increases in the middle of 2013. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased in March by 0.1 percent, a lower increase than that in recent months. The Climate Index, based on the Business Tendency Survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics, reflects a monthly growth rate of 0.27 percent in the business sector. The Purchasing Managers Index for March declined to about 49 points, and has fluctuated in recent months around the 50 point level, considered the boundary between contraction and growth of activity. The Consumer Confidence Indices compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics and by Bank Hapoalim showed improvement in March. The labor market: Labor Force Survey data for February indicatea decline in the unemployment rate among 25-64 year olds, to a lowlevel of 4.9 percent, at the same time as an increase in the employment rate (76 percent) and in the participation rate (79.9 percent). The overall unemployment rate declined to 5.8 percent. It should be noted that changes in the labor market apparently contributed to the decline in the frictional component of unemployment in recent years. In January, compared with December, there was an increase of 0.7 percent (21,500 posts) in the number of employee posts of Israelis, and data on employee posts in the second half of 2013 were revised upward. Over the 12 months ending in January, the rate ofgrowth in the number of employee posts in public services (3.1 percent) was still higher than the rate of growth in the business sector (0.7 percent), but the gap between the two sectors is narrowing. Nominal wages increasedby 0.8 percent, and real wages declined by 0.3 percent, in November-January, compared with August-October. Health tax receipts by the National Insurance Institute, which provide an indication of total wage payments in the economy, were 3.4 percent higher in February-March, on a nominal basis, than in the corresponding two months of the previous year. After the number of job vacancies in the business sector stabilized in recent months at around 60,000, there was a sharp increase to about 68,000 job vacancies in March. Budget data: In the first quarter of 2014, the government's domestic surplus (excluding net credit) was NIS 0.7 billion. NIS 0.3 billion higher than the seasonal path consistent with meeting the deficit target for 2014. Tax revenues in the first quarter were 6 percent greater in real terms than in the corresponding period of last year (net of legislative changes and one-time revenues). Trend data indicate an increase in directtax revenues and stability in revenues from indirect taxes. Gross VAT receipts on domestic production, which serve as an indication of the level of activity in the economy, increased by about 9 percent in real terms comparedwith March 2013, and they increased by about 3 percent net of legislative changes. Based on trend data, domestic expenditures (excluding credit) increased by 0.8 percent in the first quarter, compared with the final quarter of 2013, a relatively low rate of growth compared with the pace of previousquarters. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on March 23, 2014, through April 25, 2014, the shekel appreciated by 0.3 percent against the dollar and weakened by 0.1 percent against the euro. Interms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel weakened by about 0.4 percent this month. For the year to date, the effective exchange rate has remained essentially unchanged (appreciation of 0.2 percent), and has appreciated by 4.5 percent over the past 12 months. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on March 23, 2014, through April 25, 2014, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by 0.2 percent, while there were increases on most markets worldwide. Government bond yields increased along the curves. 10-year unindexed bonds traded almost unchanged, at a yield of 3.4 percent. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and corresponding 10-year US Treasury securities increased slightly, to 72 basis points, but it remains low.Makam yields increased slightly by about 5 basis points along the entire curve, and the 1-year yield is 0.71 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread increased slightly to around 95 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in March, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 16.1 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 7.4 percent. Developments in the credit markets: Total outstanding debt of the business sector increased by about NIS 2 billion (0.3 percent) in February, to NIS 779 billion, primarily as a result of debt raised through bond issuances, which was partly offset by the repayment of credit from abroad. In March, bond issuances by the nonfinancial business sector totaled just NIS 0.5 billion, against the background of the large amount of debt raised in February and waiting for the closing of financial statements at the end ofMarch. Corporate bond market spreads remained low this month as well. Outstanding household debt declined by about NIS 1.3 billion (0.3 percent) in February, to about NIS 409 billion at the end of the month. The decline was the result of net debt repayment and the decline in the CPI. In March, new mortgages taken out totaled NIS 4.5 billion. The risk characteristics of new mortgages: the loan to value ratio, the payment to income ratio, and the share of mortgages granted at variable rate interest: stabilized at lower levels after declining significantly over the course of 2013. In March, the average interest rate on new unindexed mortgages taken out declined by 0.18 percentage points, following the decline in the Bank of Israel interest rate. In the CPI-indexed track, the fixed interest rate declined by 0.06 percentage points, and the variable interest rate declined by 0.12 percentage points. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.9 percent in March. In the 12 months ending in March, this component increased by 3.2 percent, similar to the rate over the 12 months ending in February (3.1 percent). Home prices, which are measured in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased by 0.6 percent in January-February. Overthe 12 months ending in February, prices increased by 6.4 percent, compared with an increase of 7.2 percent in the 12 months ended in January. The stock of unsold (private initiative) homes declined in February. In the 12 months ended in January, there were 42,700 building starts and 42,600 building completions. In February, the number of transactions declined, without a major change in the distribution between first-home buyers, homeowners upgrading their residences, and investors. The global economy: This month, the IMF reduced both its globalgrowth and world trade volume forecasts by 0.1 percent, primarily against the background of a decline in projected growth in emerging markets. The growth forecast for the US remained unchanged, and the eurozone forecast was revised slightly upward. Positive data were published in the US this month,reflecting recovery from the harsh winter: purchasing managers indices improved, nonfarm payroll data indicated 192,000 jobs added in March, and there were increases in the participation rate and employment rate. There was also a positive trend in consumer confidence indices and personal consumption expenditure, though these have not yet returned to their pre-crisis levels. In addition, commercial credit is expanding, while the real estate market continues to show some weakness. There are assessments that the tapering process will continue at its current pace, and the fed funds rate will begin to be increased in the second half of 2015. In the eurozone, therewere positive developments in the purchasing managers, industrial production, consumer confidence, and retail sales indices. The rate of inflation declined in the past year to a low of 0.5 percent, but according to most assessments the economy will not see a slide into deflation. The ECB committed to taking any steps necessary in order to avoid such a development, and also noted that additional strengthening of the euro is likely to lead to moreaccommodative monetary policy. The IMF assessed that the crisis in Ukraine, should it deteriorate, is liable to weigh on eurozone recovery. Countriesthat were hit hard by the debt crisis continue to show improvement, reflected in a decline in yields, in new debt issuances (Greece), and in an increased debt rating (Portugal). In Japan, there is increasing uncertainty regarding the effect of the rise in VAT on continued growth, and leading indicators are trending down. In emerging markets the moderation of economic activity continues, and the growth forecast was reduced, primarily for Russia. East Europe. Brazil, and South Africa. Forecasts for China remained essentially unchanged, despite most indicators pointing to moderation in activity.Global inflation projections declined by 0.2 percent, and the price of a barrel of crude oil increased by 2.7 percent this month. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for May 2014 unchanged at 0.75 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth inIsrael and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: The CPI for the month of March increased by 0.3 percent, and inflation over the preceding 12 months was 1.3 percent. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. ______________________ The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for May 2014 will be published on May 12, 2014. The decision regarding the interest rate for June 2014 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. May 26, 2014.</div>. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for May 2014 will be published on May 12, 2014."
Hungary,2014-04-29,"At its meeting on 29 April, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 10 basis points from 2.60% to 2.50%, with effect from 30 April 2014. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. However, while the pace of economic activity is strengthening, output remains below its potential and is likely to return close to that level during next year. With employment rising, the unemployment rate is falling, but still exceeds its long-term level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain moderate over the medium term and inflation is likely to move into line with the medium-term inflation target from 2015. Inflation was unchanged in March relative to the previous month, remaining at 0.1 per cent. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation capturing the medium-term outlook remained broadly unchanged and continued to indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy, which reflects the effects of weak domestic demand and low inflation in external markets. The persistently low inflation environment may provide a firmer anchor for inflation expectations. The rate of private sector wage growth has picked up somewhat recently, but still remains moderate. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact, but demand-side disinflationary pressures are weakening as activity gathers pace. Data available since the Council's last interest rate decision show that economic growth continued, as reflected in monthly data on industrial output, retail sales and the performance of construction. Growth is expected to pick up gradually in the quarters ahead and to return to a more balanced pattern, with domestic demand likely to make an increasing contribution. With the increase in the Government's infrastructure projects using EU funding and in corporate investment due to the Funding for Growth Scheme, the recovery in household consumption is likely to be gradual. Growth in real incomes is expected to be partly offset by the ongoing reduction in debts accumulated during the years prior to the crisis and the slow easing in tight credit conditions. According to labour market data for March, demand for labour increased and unemployment fell, pointing to a tighter labour market looking ahead. Global investor sentiment was volatile in the past month. Market tensions intensified as a result of the escalation of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Domestic risk premia fell slightly and the forint exchange rate strengthened, showing lower volatility than in the previous month. The country's persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are reducing its vulnerability. In the Council's judgement, a cautious approach to policy is warranted due to uncertainty related to the global financial environment. In the Council's judgement, there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over the medium term. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the policy horizon; therefore, the disinflationary impact of the real economy is likely to decrease looking forward and inflation is likely to move in line with the target in the medium term. The slight improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy has provided room for a cautious reduction in interest rates. As the Monetary Council indicated in its March press release, the central bank base rate has significantly approached a level which ensures the medium-term achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support for the real economy. Over the coming period, changes in the domestic and international environment might influence this picture. The Monetary Council always considers carefully the macroeconomic outlook and developments in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy before deciding on the direction and magnitude of the next change in the policy rate."
United States,2014-04-30,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that growth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply during the winter in part because of adverse weather conditions. Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. The unemployment rate, however, remains elevated. Household spending appears to be rising more quickly. Business fixed investment edged down, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in May, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $20 billion per month rather than $25 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $25 billion per month rather than $30 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

Romania,2014-05-06,"The NBR examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report which will be presented to the public in a news conference scheduled for May 8, 2014. The latest macroeconomic data underscore the inflation rate sticking to low levels, in line with central bank projections. This development was further underpinned by fundamentals, namely the persistence of the negative output gap and the maintenance of inflation expectations inside the variation band of the target. One-off factors and developments in other indicators, including industrial producer prices, point to further moderate inflationary pressures. In March 2014, the annual inflation rate fell to 1.04 percent from 1.55 percent in December 2013. At the same time, the average annual inflation rate went down to 2.8 percent in March against 3.2 percent in the previous month and the average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is relevant for ensuring comparability at European level and assessing convergence with the European Union, reached 2.3 percent in March from 2.6 percent a month earlier. The continuation of disinflation in line with the forecasted path confirmed the previous monetary policy stance adjustments, amid close monitoring of domestic and global developments. This stance was aimed at effectively anchoring inflation expectations, being deemed as adequate for preserving medium-term price stability consistent with the 2.5 percent flat target, while supporting the rebound in lending. The improvement in economic activity in Romania has further been fostered by export growth and the favourable performance of the industrial sector, as well as by the gradual consolidation of consumption. Looking at the external sector, the current account and the international reserves remain in a comfortable zone while a substantial part of Romania's external public debt has been repaid. Mention should be made of the pick-up in the real growth rate of local currency-denominated loans, alongside the dynamics of foreign exchange credit posting more negative readings, thus the increase in total loans to the private sector remaining in negative territory. The share of foreign exchange loans in total credit to the private sector (stocks) fell below the 60 percent level to touch 59.5 percent for the first time in five years, helping consolidate the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Money market rates, particularly those serving as a benchmark for borrowing agreements, hover around the monetary policy rate, allowing for a further adjustment of lending rates on new business. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which reiterates the outlook for the annual inflation rate to run over the medium term inside the variation band of the target, i.e. ±1 percentage point around the 2.5 percent multiannual flat target, starting in the latter half of 2014. Thus, according to the new projection, the annual inflation rate will be 3.3 percent at end-2014 and end-2015, concurrently with the average annual inflation rate evolving in the proximity of the multiannual flat target. Similarly to the previous assessments, the risks associated with this outlook stem primarily from external sources, namely the variability of investors' risk appetite over the short and medium term in relation to emerging economies as a whole amid the recent geopolitical and regional tensions, the ongoing cross-border deleveraging across the banking system and the effects of monetary policy stance adjustments by major central banks. Domestically, the risks and uncertainties relate to the persistence of structural rigidities across the Romanian economy, which calls for fast-paced reforms, as agreed under the financing arrangements signed with the international institutions. Against this background, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged at 3.5 percent per annum and to pursue an adequate liquidity management in the banking system. At the same time, the Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions, while reiterating that their harmonisation with European levels over the medium term will continue at an appropriate pace and time, conditional on the economic and financial environment domestically and externally. These decisions help attain the overriding objective of preserving medium-term price stability as well as financial stability, paving the way for balanced and lasting economic growth. In this context, the consistent implementation of an adequate macroeconomic policy mix, in line with the provisions of the external financing arrangements, and balanced social and political developments during the 2014 election year are pivotal to consolidating favourable prospects for the Romanian economy, thereby enhancing its resilience to external shocks. The NBR monitors closely the domestic and global economic developments so as, by calibrating the monetary policy conduct and making adequate use of its available tools, to maintain medium-term price stability and financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a news conference on 8 May 2014. According to the approved calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 1 July 2014.

Czech Republic,2014-05-07,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions. It also confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna against the euro so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. The nature of this exchange rate commitment is unchanged.. This decision is underpinned by a new forecast, which is based on an assumption of stable market interest rates at their current very low level and a flat exchange rate of the koruna close to CZK 27 to the euro until the start of next year. At the forecast horizon, the return to conventional monetary policy will not imply appreciation of the exchange rate to the level recorded before the CNB started intervening. This is because the weaker exchange rate of the koruna will in the meantime pass through to the price level and other nominal variables. The Bank Board considers the risks to the new forecast to be slightly anti-inflationary. The Bank Board continues to view the level of the exchange rate commitment at CZK 27 to the euro as appropriate and expects the exchange rate to be kept close to this level at least until the start of 2015. In a debate of the new forecast, however, the Bank Board stated that the probability of a later exit from the exchange rate commitment was increasing. The forecast lowers the inflation outlook, and in line with the CNB's previous communications, it holds true that if economic developments require a further easing of monetary policy, the Bank Board will prefer to maintain the exchange rate commitment for a longer time. The same time the Bank Board concluded that domestic interest rates will not necessarily rise as fast as indicated by the forecast in 2015. Turning to the assumptions of the forecast regarding developments abroad, economic growth in the euro area will gradually pick up pace this year and the next. Euro area producer prices are currently falling as a result of the long-running economic downturn, a continuing decline in energy prices and a strong euro. A return to positive, albeit subdued, growth in producer prices in the euro area is expected at the forecast horizon. Consumer prices in the euro area will also rise only slightly owing to the recovering demand. The subdued price developments are reflected in the currently easy monetary policy of the ECB and in the 3M EURIBOR rate outlook. These rates remain very low over the entire forecast horizon. Overall, the outlook for the euro area has shifted towards lower inflation and easier monetary policy. The assumption for euro area economic growth has been increased only slightly for this year. The outlook for the Brent crude oil price continues to expect a gradual decline. However, there has been an upward revision of about 3 dollars a barrel over the entire outlook horizon compared to the previous forecast. The euro should depreciate gradually against the US dollar from its current relatively strong level. The euro exchange rate is expected to be about 2% stronger than in the previous forecast over the entire forecast horizon. The modest decline in world prices of commodities and energy combined with the evolution of the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar still does not imply significant cost-push inflation pressures. As regards developments in the Czech economy, the forecast expects headline inflation to increase this year from its current low but positive level. The weaker koruna, without which inflation would have been deep in negative territory at the start of this year, will continue to affect inflation through import prices. However, this effect will gradually fade from the second quarter of this year onwards. Starting in the second half of this year, consumer price inflation will also be strongly affected by continuing growth of the domestic economy and a recovery in wages. A moderation of the annual decline in administered prices, which will fade out in early 2015, will also foster higher inflation in the course of this year. At the same time, food price inflation will accelerate slightly following the recent increase in world prices of agricultural commodities. Headline inflation will get just above the target at the start of next year. In the second half of 2015 it will return to the 2% target, where it will stabilise. Average inflation will be 0.8% in 2014. Next year it will increase to 2.2%. Both levels are 0.4 percentage point lower than in the previous forecast. Monetary-policy relevant inflation, i.e. inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, will return towards the target at the end of this year and stay very close to the target next year. Following a decline in the previous two years, the economy will grow by 2.6% this year according to the forecast. Economic growth will be fostered by accelerating external demand, the easing of the domestic monetary conditions via the exchange rate of the koruna and, to a lesser extent, also fiscal policy. Economic growth will pick up further to 3.3% in 2015, boosted by a further slight increase in growth abroad and relatively robust growth in domestic demand in an environment of significantly expansionary fiscal policy. The economic recovery will also start to have a favourable effect on the labour market. Total employment will increase further in year-on-year terms and average hours worked per employee will also start increasing. The seasonally adjusted general unemployment rate and the share of unemployed persons as determined by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs will decrease gradually. Wage growth in the business sector will recover from the very subdued levels recorded at the close of last year. The forecast expects market interest rates to be flat at their current very low level until the start of next year, followed by a gradual rise in market rates into 2015 by about 0.6 percentage point. Both headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation are lower than in the previous forecast owing to a lower outlook for administered price and a lower prediction for net inflation. The latter mainly reflects the more subdued wage growth recorded at the end of last year. So far the weaker exchange rate has been passing through to prices in line with the CNB's expectations. Expected GDP growth has been revised upwards in both 2014 and 2015, mainly as a result of expected higher investment activity in both the private and government sectors and more expansionary fiscal policy overall. After the discontinuation of the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument the interest rate path in the prediction is lower, mainly reflecting a lower outlook for foreign interest rates and prices in 2015, as well as a lower outlook for domestic administered prices and net inflation."
Georgia,2014-05-07,"07.05.14 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate unchanged at 4.00%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on May 7, 2014 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 4 percent. At a February meeting the MPC decided to start gradual exit from accommodative monetary policy. In order to ensure price stability the Committee considers the macroeconomic forecast and current risks analysis when formulating monetary policy decisions. Given improvements in economic activity and increase of the expected inflation, which gradually gets closer to the target value, the Committee still considers the exit out of accommodative policy necessary. However, recently originated geopolitical risks contain increased uncertainty for the economic environment and taking those risks into account the committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this stage. As regarding the domestic demand, the positive tendencies have been retained in the first quarter of 2014. Economic activity keeps growing at a moderate rate: according to preliminary estimates the economic growth in the first quarter of 2014 was 7.4%, which, to a certain extent, was due to a base effect. Despite high growth levels the output gap is still negative. One should also mention the relative slowdown in credit activities in the recent period. Given the existing data the NBG forecast indicates that inflation will gradually grow and most likely will reach its target value in the second half of 2014. Annual inflation in April 2014 was 3.4%. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets both domestically and abroad and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure the price stability. The dynamics of further changes in monetary policy will depend on the dynamics of expected inflation, tendencies in economic growth, global and regional economic environment. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on June 18, 2014."
Philippines,2014-05-07,"Statement by BSP Governor Amando M Tetangco. Jr. At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy rates at 3.50 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 5.50 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs and RPs as well as SDAs were also kept steady. Meanwhile, the Monetary Board decided to increase the reserve requirements for universal and commercial banks as well as thrift banks by a further one percentage point effective on 30 May 2014. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that current monetary policy settings continue to be appropriate given a manageable inflation environment. Latest baseline forecasts show that the future inflation path is likely to stay within the target ranges of 4±1 percent for 2014 and 3±1 percent for 2015. Inflation expectations also remain broadly aligned with the target ranges over the policy horizon. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook continues to lean toward the upside, with potential price pressures emanating from the possible uptick in food prices, as a result of expected drier weather conditions, as well as pending petitions for adjustments in transport fares and power rates. The adjustments in the reserve requirements are expected to help mitigate potential risks to financial stability that could arise from the strong growth in domestic liquidity. The Monetary Board believes that solid domestic economic activity provides room for the hike in the reserve requirements. Going forward, the BSP will continue to pay close attention to the outlook for inflation and growth to ensure that monetary policy settings remain consistent with price and financial stability. The BSP also remains prepared to implement policy actions as needed to prevent a potential build-up in inflation expectations and financial imbalances."
Poland,2014-05-07,"Warsaw, 7 May 2014 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 6-7 May 2014 The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 2.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 4.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis;  bill rediscount rate at 2.75% on an annual basis. Growth in global economic activity remains moderate, although the economic situation varies across countries. In the United States. GDP growth slowed down in 2014 Q1, yet recent data have indicated an improvement in business conditions in the subsequent months. At the same time, recovery in the euro area continues, albeit at a moderate pace. In the largest emerging market economies, activity growth remains slow relative to previous performance, including China, where it weakened in 2014 Q1. Moderate growth in global economic activity is conducive to maintaining low inflation in many countries. Data on domestic economic activity confirm a continuation of the gradual recovery in Poland. In March, industrial output and retail sales continued to rise, yet slower than expected. At the same time, construction and assembly output picked up. Business climate indicators  despite some weakening in March  still point to further activity growth in the coming quarters. Gradual acceleration in economic activity is accompanied by moderate lending growth, both to firms and households. The recovery is gradually translating into improvement of labour market conditions. Employment in the enterprise sector is slowly rising, and unemployment is gradually falling. However, the unemployment rate is still elevated, which restricts wage pressure in the economy. In March. CPI inflation amounted to 0.7%, thus remaining markedly below the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. Core inflation also remained low, and producer prices continued to fall. This was accompanied by low inflation expectations. In the opinion of the Council, gradual economic recovery is likely to continue in the coming quarters, however, inflationary pressures will remain subdued. Therefore, the Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council maintains its assessment that NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged for a longer period of time, i.e. at least until the end of the third quarter of 2014. In the opinion of the Council, lowering interest rates in the first half of 2013 and keeping them unchanged in subsequent quarters supports the recovery of the domestic 1/2 economy, a gradual return of inflation to the target and a stabilisation in the financial markets."
Euroarea,2014-05-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I would like to thank Governor Coene for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Finance Minister Dijsselbloem. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Incoming information continues to indicate that the moderate recovery of the euro area economy is proceeding in line with our previous assessment. At the same time, recent information remains consistent with our expectation of a prolonged period of low inflation followed by only a gradual upward movement in HICP inflation rates. The signals from the monetary analysis confirm the picture of subdued underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term. Inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Looking ahead, we will monitor economic developments and money markets very closely. We will maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation and act swiftly, if required, with further monetary policy easing. We firmly reiterate that we continue to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation is based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy, the high degree of unutilised capacity, and subdued money and credit creation. The Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments within its mandate in order to cope effectively with risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation. Further information and analysis concerning the outlook for inflation and the availability of bank loans to the private sector will be available in early June. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP in the euro area rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the last quarter of 2013, thereby increasing for three consecutive quarters. Recent data and survey indicators confirm that the ongoing moderate recovery continued in the first quarter of 2014 and at the beginning of the second quarter. Looking ahead, domestic demand should continue to be supported by a number of factors, including the accommodative monetary policy stance, ongoing improvements in financing conditions working their way through to the real economy, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, and developments in energy prices. At the same time, although labour markets have stabilised and shown the first signs of improvement, unemployment remains high in the euro area and, overall, unutilised capacity continues to be sizeable. Moreover, the annual rate of change of MFI loans to the private sector remained negative in March and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors continue to weigh on the pace of the economic recovery. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. Geopolitical risks, as well as developments in global financial markets and emerging market economies, may have the potential to affect economic conditions negatively. Other downside risks include weaker than expected domestic demand and insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries, as well as weaker export growth. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.7% in April 2014, up from 0.5% in March. As expected, given the timing of Easter, the increase was mainly due to a rise in services prices. On the basis of current information, annual HICP inflation is expected to remain around present low levels over the coming months, before only gradually increasing during 2015 to reach levels closer to 2% towards the end of 2016. New macroeconomic projections by Eurosystem staff will become available in early June. Medium to long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. The Governing Council sees both upside and downside risks to the outlook for price developments as limited and broadly balanced over the medium term. In this context, the possible repercussions of both geopolitical risks and exchange rate developments will be monitored closely. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for March 2014 continue to point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (M3). Annual growth in M3 moderated to 1.1% in March, from 1.3% in February. The growth of the narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained robust but decreased to 5.6 % in March, after 6.2% in February. The increase in the MFI net external asset position, reflecting in part the continued interest of international investors in euro area assets, remains the main factor supporting annual M3 growth. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -3.1% in March, unchanged from February. Weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.4% in March 2014, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. The April 2014 bank lending survey confirmed the stabilisation of credit conditions for loans to enterprises and households. Credit standards over the previous three months remained broadly unchanged for loans to enterprises but were eased in net terms for households. Broadly in line with these results, in the survey on the access to finance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for the period October 2013-March 2014. SMEs reported that bank loan availability had become less negative and had actually improved in some euro area countries. According to both surveys, the general economic outlook contributed less negatively or even positively to these developments. At the same time, banks still reported tight levels of credit standards when seen in a historical perspective. Since the summer of 2012, substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks. In order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. In this context, the ongoing comprehensive assessment of banks' balance sheets is of key importance. Banks should take full advantage of this exercise to improve their capital and solvency position, thereby contributing to overcome any existing credit supply restriction that could hamper the recovery. To sum up, the economic analysis confirms our expectation of a prolonged period of low inflation followed by only a gradual upward movement in HICP inflation rates towards levels closer to 2%. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms the picture of subdued underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term. Regarding fiscal policies, according to the European Commission's spring forecast, the general government deficit in the euro area is expected to decline further, from 3.0% of GDP in 2013 to 2.5% this year and to 2.3% in 2015. The government debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to stabilise at 96.0% in 2014 and to decline to 95.4% in 2015. In view of still rather high debt ratios and to improve fiscal sustainability, euro area countries should not unravel progress made with fiscal consolidation and should comply with their commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact. At the same time, comprehensive and ambitious structural reforms in product and labour markets are warranted to lift the euro area's growth potential, improve its adjustment capacity and reduce the high unemployment facing many euro area countries today. To this end, the Governing Council concurs with Tuesday's ECOFIN Council communication that decisive policy action is needed in countries where macroeconomic imbalances hinder the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union."
Malaysia,2014-05-08,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. Global growth moderated in the first quarter with several key economies affected by weather-related and policy-induced factors. Looking ahead, the global economy is expected to remain on a path of gradual recovery. In Asia, the better external environment provides further support to growth amid continued expansion in domestic demand. Conditions in the international financial markets have also improved following gradual and orderly policy adjustments in the major advanced economies while the impact from geopolitical developments remains contained. For Malaysia, latest indicators suggest that the domestic economy continued to register favourable performance in the first quarter. Going forward, growth will remain anchored by domestic demand with additional support from the improved external environment. Exports will continue to benefit from the recovery in the advanced economies and regional demand. Private sector spending is expected to remain robust. Investment activity is supported by broad-based capital spending, particularly in the manufacturing and services sectors. Private consumption will be underpinned by stable income growth and favourable labour market conditions. The prospects are therefore for the growth momentum to be sustained. Inflation has stabilised in recent months amid the more favourable weather conditions and as the impact of the price adjustments for utilities and energy moderate. Going forward, inflation is, however, expected to remain above its long-run average due to the higher domestic cost factors. Amid the firm growth prospects and inflation remaining above its long-run average, there are signs of the continued build-up of financial imbalances. While the macro and micro prudential measures have had a moderating impact on the growth of household indebtedness, the current monetary and financial conditions could lead to a broader build up in economic and financial imbalances. Going forward, the degree of monetary accommodation may need to be adjusted to ensure that the risks arising from the accumulation of these imbalances would not undermine the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy.

South Korea,2014-05-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to have continued to ease, while economic growth trends in some emerging market countries have weakened somewhat. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance, by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries, and by geopolitical risks in Eastern Europe. In Korea, the Committee appraises the economic recovery to have continued in line with the trend of growth, as exports have sustained their buoyancy. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has continued its substantial uptrend, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for the time being going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will gradually narrow. Consumer price inflation rose from 1.3% the previous month to 1.5% in April, due mainly to expansions in the extents of increase in service fees and in industrial product prices. Core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products also rose from 2.1% to 2.3%. The Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, although it will remain low for the time being due largely to the stability of agricultural product prices. Regarding the housing market, the uptrends of sales and leasehold deposit prices in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and in the rest of the country slowed. In the domestic financial markets, after having risen owing chiefly to net stock purchases by foreigners, stock prices have since fallen considerably under the influence for example of geopolitical risks in Eastern Europe. The Korean won has appreciated substantially, due mainly to the continuation of the current account surplus and to inflows of foreigners' securities investment funds. Long-term market interest rates have meanwhile moved within a narrow range. Looking ahead, while paying close attention to external risk factors such as shifts in major countries' monetary policies, and closely monitoring the movements in domestic demand following the Sewol ferry accident, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while supporting the continued recovery of economic growth."
Armenia,2014-05-13,"Press Release 13.05.2014 Interest rate lowered, to 7.25 percent In the May 13, 2014 Meeting, the Board of the CBA decided to lower the Refinancing Rate of the CBA by 0.25 pp to 7.25 percent. There was 0.5 percent of deflation in April of 2014, against 0.1 percent of deflation recorded in the same month of the previous year, with the 12-month inflation having amounted to 4.4 percent. In the coming months, the Board considers, the 12-month inflation rate will reduce and will rest closer to the lower bound of the confidence band most probably during the third quarter, which will be attributable to phasing out impact of energy prices that had risen back in July of 2013. The Board acknowledged that uncertainties in the external sector in connection with global economic outlook and growth perspectives in trade partners have increased considerably amidst geopolitical developments. The Board estimates that economic growth trends remain sluggish for the past period of 2014, mostly explained by a slow pace with which construction recovers as well as current developments in industry. Although the monetary conditions eased up to now as well as an expansionary fiscal policy expected since the second half of 2014 will lead to a broadening aggregate demand and rebounding inflation rates, it will not however be enough to offset the deviation of the 12-month inflation from its target. In such a situation, the Board finds it reasonable to reduce the refinancing rate, whilst creating favorable conditions for boosting up the economy and attaining the inflation target in the medium run. Yet, the Board admits that future economic developments in both external and domestic environments may prompt the CBA to adjust the directions of the monetary policy, while attempting to attain the inflation target in the forecast horizon. More information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program Q2, 2014) due on May 23rd, 2014. Press Service of the Central Bank."
Chile,2014-05-15,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 15 May 2014 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy meeting at 4% annual. Internationally, incoming information confirms the outlook of recovery of the developed economies, while projections of moderate growth in emerging markets are maintained. External financial conditions improved in the last month and the dollar depreciated globally. With respect to commodity prices, the rebound of the copper price stands out. Inflation remains bounded in the developed world, so markets continue to anticipate a slow normalization of their monetary policies. Local economic indicators confirm the low dynamism of output and demand, in line with the baseline scenario of March's Monetary Policy Report. Despite signs of less dynamism in the labor market, the unemployment rate remains low. April's inflation exceeded forecasts at 4.3% annually. Core inflation measures and nominal wage variation also picked up in the last month. Medium- term inflation expectations remain around 3% annually. The most likely scenario assumes that the rise in inflation —associated with the peso depreciation, among other factors— is a temporary development, that will continue to be monitored with special attention. The Board will consider the possibility of making additional cuts to the monetary policy rate in line with the evolution of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions and its implications on the inflationary outlook. At the same time, the Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2014-05-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2014 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.0 percent. This level of the reference rate is compatible with an inflation forecast converging to the target range in 2014 and to 2 percent in 2015. The decision of maintaining the monetary policy rate takes into account that: inflation expectations remain anchored within the inflation target range; GDP has been recording lower growth rates than the country's potential level of growth; recent indicators show mixed signals of recovery in the world economy, and the supply factors that led inflation to increase are becoming more moderate. Inflation in April showed a rate of 0.39 percent and thus inflation in the last 12 months rose from 3.38 percent in March to 3.52 percent in April, as reflected in the price rise of some food products due to seasonal factors. The rate of inflation without food and energy was 0.20 percent. As a result of this, the rate of inflation in the last 12 months accumulated 2.83 percent. Inflation is forecast to remain initially close to the upper band of the target range due to the lagging effect of the supply shocks and to converge thereafter to the 2 percent target. Indicators of activity and the surveys on macroeconomic expectations point to dynamism in economic activity, although showing lower rates than expected. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants and, if necessary, will implement additional monetary policy measures. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 2.80 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for June on its meeting of June 12, 2014."
Pakistan,2014-05-17,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 17th May 2014 Recent gains in confidence in the economy, backed by improvement in key indicators, need to be nurtured to ensure their sustainability. For instance, the average CPI inflation has remained in single digits during FY14 and policy vigilance is required for this trend to continue. Economic activity has improved and further reforms, especially in the energy sector, would help consolidate the momentum. Similarly improvement in productivity and competitiveness is must to continue to build foreign exchange reserves in the medium term while meeting external obligations. The year-on-year CPI inflation has remained volatile during FY14. It increased sharply till November 2013 then declined for few months before increasing again to. percent in April 2014. The average CPI inflation for July-April. FY14 is. percent; higher than the year's target of percent. The main reason for this volatility is unexpected movements in food prices and changes in administered prices. The core inflation, however, has remained quite stable at around percent over the past 12 months. Importantly from the point of view of monetary policy, it is the outlook of inflation that matters. The SBP expects average CPI inflation to remain around percent during FY15, barring any exogenous shock. Basic factors supporting this assessment are: moderate aggregate demand; deceleration in broad money growth led by contained government budgetary borrowings from the banking system; expectations of low inflationary pressures as indicated by SBP-IBA consumer confidence survey; and stable outlook of international commodity prices. Indicators of current economic activity are looking better as well. Provisional estimates of real GDP show growth of. percent for FY14. Encouragingly this growth has been led by. percent increase in the industrial sector output. Examination of private credit data also points in the direction of improved economic activity. For instance, the flow of net credit to private sector was almost two and half times more during the first nine months of current fiscal year compared to the corresponding period of last year. Similarly the monthly average gross credit disbursements, arguably better gauge of the nexus between credit and production, during the same period are about Rs150 billion higher this year. These trends show that interest rate is only one factor in affecting economic activity. It is the improvement in sentiments, relatively better availability of energy, and reduction in government borrowing from the banking system that has encouraged the private sector. The continuation of these trends, however, would require sustained effort to ease impediments to growth through implementation of necessary reforms. In particular, reforms in the energy sector can go long way in increasing productivity, easing the fiscal burden, and reducing the import bill. Because of the gap between imports and exports, the trade deficit remains at an elevated level of $12. billion during July-March. FY14. Also the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) has appreciated by. percent in Q3-FY14 and its potential impact on the trade balance needs to be monitored carefully going forward. Nevertheless mainly due to robust growth in worker's remittances, the external current account deficit, at $2. billion, seems quite manageable at this point in time. This is because the capital Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN and financial account net flows have also improved to $2. billion, considerably easing the pressure on the balance of payments position. In fact, the SBP was able to meet the IMF's adjusted Net International Reserve (NIR) target for end-March 2014 by wide margin. After including the better-than-projected inflows from the issuance of Euro bonds of $2 billion and other inflows from multilateral sources in April and early May 2014, the SBP's foreign exchange reserves have increased to $8. billion by 9th May 2014 from $5. billion at end-March 2014. This marked improvement in reserves and the consequent stability in the foreign exchange market is the main indicator of improved sentiments in and about the economy. In turn, these sentiments could help in attracting more financial inflows and thus lead to further increases in reserves. The SBP also remains committed to play its role in ensuring further accumulation of reserves to achieve adequate levels in the medium term. Despite shortfall in tax collection compared to the budgeted target, the government has been able to contain the fiscal deficit at. percent during July-March. FY14. Consequently government borrowing for budgetary support from the banking system has come down to Rs276 billion during 1st July 2nd May. FY14 compared to Rs1021 billion during the corresponding period of last year. In particular, government borrowing from SBP shows net retirement of Rs287 billion as compared to an increase of Rs393 billion last year. Moreover the government was also able to keep its borrowings from SBP below the IMF target for end-March 2014. Based on balanced assessment of these considerations, the SBP's Board of Directors has decided to maintain the policy rate at 10 percent. Page of."
Nigeria,2014-05-19,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 95 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of May 19 and 20, 2014 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 19th and 20th May, 2014 against the backdrop of continuing modest recovery in the US economy, lingering fragile recovery in Europe, slowing output growth in the emerging market economies and possible risks to domestic price stability. In attendance were 9 members including Mr. Adebayo Adelabu, the new Deputy Governor. Financial System Stability. The Committee considered major developments in both the global and domestic economies up to May 2014, and the outlook for the rest of the year. International Economic Developments The Committee noted the prospects of improved global growth in 2014 predicated on expectations of sustained favorable developments in the US and the euro area. Driven by the recovery in the advanced economies, global growth strengthened in the second half of 2013, averaging 36 per cent from the 26 per cent recorded during the first half. In the United States, improved domestic demand continues to strengthen growth outlook. In Europe, a pickup in growth in the core states continued to compensate for the decline in most of the peripheral states even as debt, low inflation, financial fragmentation and unemployment persisted as threats to sustainable long term economic recovery in the region. Growth in the emerging markets and developing economies is projected to rise from 47 per cent in 2013 to 49 per cent in 2014. The effects of tighter financial conditions in these economies are expected to be moderated by improved external demand from the advanced economies. Global inflation is generally expected to remain subdued in 2014 with sustained sizable negative output gaps in the advanced economies, weaker domestic demand in several emerging economies, and falling commodity prices. In the euro area and the United States, headline inflation at about 15 per cent is projected to remain below the long-term inflation expectations. Lower world commodity prices in US. dollar terms would help reduce price pressures, although in some economies, exchange rate depreciation continues to pose a threat to consumer price stability. The Committee noted that monetary policy stance across the advanced economies could begin to diverge in 2014/15. In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate is expected to increase, post-tapering, in 2015. On the contrary, markets continue to expect a prolonged period of low interest rates and supportive monetary policy in the euro area and Japan. In the emerging market economies, there has been a tightening of monetary and financial conditions since mid-2013, owing to the combined effect of spillovers from rising bond rates and better economic prospects in the advanced economies based on the markets' reassessment of medium-term growth prospects. The risks posed to the emerging economies by capital reversals in the post-tapering era remain a major challenge to the outlook. Overall global economic outlook remains benign with prospects of steady and gradual improvements in the major economies, as well as slowing but sustained healthy growth in the emerging markets and developing economies. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output The Committee noted that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth remains robust. The recently rebased GDP figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated that real GDP grew by 741 per cent in 2013, compared with the 509 and 666 per cent recorded in 2011 and 2012, respectively. From the 2 rebased GDP, the new major sectors of the economy in 2013 in terms of their share in GDP were: Services (3608%); Industry (2173%); Agriculture (2150%) and Trade (1706%). Figures for the first quarter of 2014 based on the rebased GDP are yet to be released by the NBS. The non-oil sector remained the main source of overall growth performance (777%), driven largely by: agriculture (043%), industry (128%) of which manufacturing was 126% and construction (062%); trade (154%) and services (389%). Prices Inflation has remained within the indicative benchmark target range of 60-90 per cent during the first four months of 2014. On a year-on-year basis, however, headline inflation inched up to 79 per cent in April from 78 per cent in March 2014. Food inflation, which was 93 per cent in January, declined to 92 per cent in February and slightly increased to 93 and 94 per cent in March and April, 2014, respectively. Core inflation, which declined to 66 per cent in January, increased to 72 per cent in February, and rose further to 75 per cent in April, 2014. The Committee noted that headline inflation has remained within single digit in the last sixteen months and stressed its commitment to sustain price stability; defined by the Bank's indicative benchmark range. Monetary Credit and Financial Markets' Developments Broad money supply (M2) increased by 194 per cent in April, over the level at end- December 2013. When annualized. M2 increased by 583 per cent. M2 was however, below the growth benchmark of 1552 per cent for 2014. The increase in money supply reflected the growth in the net domestic credit (NDC) of 162 per cent in April. Annualized NDC grew by 485 per cent over the end-December, 2013 level. It is, however, below the provisional benchmark of 285 per cent for 2014. The slow growth in aggregate credit was traced mainly to Federal Government borrowing which contracted by 1806 per cent in April 2014 or 5418 per cent on annualized basis. In the period under review, money market interest rates remained within the MPR corridor of +/- 200 basis points; oscillating in tandem with the level of liquidity in the banking system. The inter-bank call and OBB rates 3 averaged 105 and 1059 per cent, respectively, in April. As at mid-May, the inter- bank call rate stood at 1057 per cent while the OBB rate was 1032 per cent. The Committee noted the modest improvement in the equities segment of the capital market in the review period. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) increased by 33 per cent from N1245 trillion to N1285 trillion in the same period. However relative to end-December 2013, the indices declined by 56 and 28 per cent, respectively. This was traced partly to the impact of the response of global financial markets to QE. tapering by the US Fed, weak economic performance in the emerging markets and fragile recovery in the Eurozone. External Sector Developments The naira exchange rate remained stable at the rDAS window but appreciated at the interbank and the BDC segments of the market. The exchange rate at the rDAS-SPT during the review period (March 26,,-May 16, 2014) strengthened to N15729/US$ from N15730/US$, representing an appreciation of N001k or 001 per cent. At the Interbank foreign exchange market, the selling rate opened at N16465/US$ and closed at N16233/US$, representing an appreciation of 141 per cent or N232k in the same period. At the BDC segment of the foreign exchange market, the naira which sold at N17200/US$ on March 26, closed at N16700/US$ on May 16; indicating an appreciation of 291 per cent. Gross official reserves as at May 15, 2014 stood at US$3830 billion compared with US$3740 billion at end-March and US$4285 billion at end-December 2013. The current level of the country's external reserves could provide approximately 9 months of imports cover. The Committee's Considerations The MPC noted the mixed signals over the global growth prospects in the advanced, emerging markets and developing economies. From the United States, 4 the continued gains in employment, rising inflation and growth stability could soon pave way for policy tightening. On the contrary, the outlook for monetary policy appears biased towards sustaining easy monetary stance in the euro area and Japan against the backdrop of slow and uneven recovery in the region. For the emerging markets and developing countries, the Committee was concerned that the current underlying pressures on their currencies arising from capital flow reversals, increases in consumer prices and declining inflows, which preclude the use of expansionary monetary policy to stabilize domestic output and employment in the short run, could dampen growth prospects. The Committee noted with satisfaction Nigeria's overall domestic economic environment which has remained stable with inflation contained within the target range, the recent stability in the foreign exchange market, stable interbank rates and strong growth outlook. The key challenge for policy, in the Committee's view, was that of sustaining and deepening the outcomes of existing policies. It noted, also, that over the medium term, the major risks to price stability appeared to be emanating from both external and internal sources. From the external environment, risks to the domestic economy include the prospects for increased yields and interest rates in the US and the rather low level of economic activity in the emerging markets; both of which could have repercussions for foreign exchange inflows (private and official) and stability of the naira exchange rate. Internally the key risk factors include the high systemic banking system liquidity, elevated security concerns and anticipated high election-related spending in the run-up to the 2015 general elections. High domestic liquidity could exert sustained pressure on both the exchange rate and consumer prices, as well as accentuate the already high demand for foreign exchange, further depleting the country's external reserves. In addition, core inflation has continued to send conflicting signals since January 2014. If the upward trend continues as observed in April 2014, it could be a major factor in the upward trend in prices. The Committee also expressed concern over the eroded fiscal buffers which have exposed the economy to vulnerabilities arising from both domestic and external shocks. The erosion has accentuated the regime of persistently high interest rates, elevated demand for foreign exchange and declining reserves accretion. The Committee enjoined the Management of the Bank to continue to monitor developments in the fiscal space with a view to taking appropriate monetary policy actions. In the light of the foregoing, the Committee acknowledged the success of monetary policy measures in attaining price and exchange rate stability and considered: the potential headwinds in 2014, the ultimate goal of transiting to a truly low-inflation environment; and the need to retain portfolio flows. The Committee unanimously voted to retain the current stance of monetary policy. In addition, one member voted for an asymmetric corridor around the MPR. Consequently the Committee voted to:  hold the MPR at 12%;  keep the CRR on public sector deposits at 75% and CRR on private sector deposits at 15%;  retain the MPR corridor at +/-200 basis points. Thank you Sarah O Alade Acting Governor Central Bank of Nigeria 20th May, 2014 6."
Turkiye,2014-05-22,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 12 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been kept at 11.5 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 8 percent. b) One-week repo rate has been reduced from 10 percent to 9.5 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been kept at 13.5 percent. With the recent decline in uncertainties and improvement in the risk premium indicators, market interest rates have fallen across all maturities. In this regard, the Committee decided on a measured decrease in the one week funding rate. The Committee stated that, with a flat yield curve even after this decision, the monetary policy stance will continue to be tight. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. In line with these developments, recent data indicate to a modest course in private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, with the help of the recovery in foreign demand, the contribution of net exports to economic growth is expected to increase. The Committee expects that such a demand composition will support disinflation and will lead to a significant improvement in the current account deficit in 2014. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2014-05-22,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 22 May 2014 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, inflation has breached the upper end of the target band and is expected to remain outside the target for some time. This development was in line with the Bank's inflation forecast, which is more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC. The exchange rate has appreciated somewhat since its lows in January in response to a more benign global monetary policy environment, moderating some of the near-term upside risks to inflation. Nevertheless, risks to the inflation outlook remain skewed to the upside. Despite a more favourable global growth environment, the domestic economic growth outlook has deteriorated markedly. There is still no end in sight to the protracted strike in the platinum sector, and the economic and social costs are escalating and are potentially devastating. Both the mining and manufacturing 1. Both the mining and manufacturing 1 sectors appear to have contracted in the first quarter, with electricity supply constraints adding to the weak outlook. Against this backdrop, monetary policy faces an increasingly challenging scenario. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 6,0 per cent and 6,1 per cent in March and April 2014 respectively, up from 5,9 per cent in February. Food and non-alcoholic beverage price inflation accelerated significantly, measuring 7,0 per cent and 7,8 per cent in the past two months, compared with a recent low of 3,5 per cent in December. The contribution of this category to headline inflation was 1,2 percentage points in April compared with 0,8 percentage points in February. The categories of food, housing utilities and transport together accounted for 3,7 percentage points of the inflation outcome in April. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, measured 5,5 per cent in March and April after six consecutive months at 5,3 per cent. Administered price inflation excluding petrol continued its gradual decline, measuring 6,5 per cent in April, from 6,7 per cent in March. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 8,2 per cent in March, compared with 7,7 per cent in February, driven mainly by food prices, and is indicative of further upside pressures on CPI inflation in the near term. The Bank's forecast of headline inflation changed marginally since the previous meeting. Inflation is expected to average 6,2 per cent in 2014, compared with 6,3 2. Inflation is expected to average 6,2 per cent in 2014, compared with 6,3 2 per cent previously, with the peak of 6,5 per cent (previously 6,6 per cent) expected in the fourth quarter. The forecast average inflation for 2015 remained unchanged at 5,8 per cent. The forecast horizon has been extended and inflation is expected to average 5,5 per cent in 2016, and 5,4 per cent in the final quarter of that year. Inflation is still expected to remain outside the target band from the second quarter of 2014 until the second quarter of 2015. The outlook for core inflation is also largely unchanged. This measure is expected to average 5,6 per cent and 5,7 per cent in 2014 and 2015 respectively, compared with the previous forecast of 5,6 per cent for both years, moderating to 5,5 per cent in 2016. The upward pressure is assessed to be a response to the lagged effects of the exchange rate depreciation rather than evidence of strong domestic demand pressures. The MPC still sees the risks to the inflation forecast to be skewed to the upside, and remains concerned that the current low level of pass-through may not persist. The Reuters survey of inflation expectations of economic analysts conducted in May is more or less unchanged since the previous survey. Inflation is expected to average 6,3 per cent in the second quarter, and 6,2 per cent in the final two quarters of this year, before returning to within the target at an average of 5,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2015. Annual inflation is expected to average 6,2 per cent in 2014, and 5,6 per cent and 5,4 per cent in the subsequent two years respectively, somewhat lower than the Bank's forecast. 3 The global economic outlook remains mixed. Growth in the US stalled in the first quarter as a consequence of the severe weather conditions, while retail sales in April were below expectations. Despite downside risk to growth from the housing market, the recovery is expected to remain on track, although at a lower rate than that forecast earlier in the year. While the Fed expects growth of between 2,8 and 3,0 per cent for 2014, the market consensus is closer to 2,5 per cent. The UK economic recovery also appears to be resilient, despite some slack in the economy. By contrast, the Eurozone continues to lag, following a lower-than- expected annualised growth rate of around 0,8 per cent in the first quarter. The annualised growth rate of 5,9 per cent recorded by the Japanese economy in the first quarter of this year is not expected to be sustained as higher consumption taxes take effect, and consensus forecasts are for annual growth of around 1,5 per cent. The Chinese economy grew at an annualised rate of 5,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 amid weakening trends in industrial production and retail sales. Although an annual growth rate of between 7,0 - 7,5 per cent is still generally expected, there are concerns that the loss of momentum in the property market and declining credit growth could pose downside risks to growth. The shift in global growth dynamics toward the advanced economies has been reinforced with a number of emerging markets facing a more challenging outlook. Low growth is expected in a number of the larger economies, including Brazil. Russia. Argentina. Turkey and Thailand, but some analysts have revised 4. Low growth is expected in a number of the larger economies, including Brazil. Russia. Argentina. Turkey and Thailand, but some analysts have revised 4 upwards their growth forecasts for India. More positively, growth in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to average 5,4 per cent, but this is vulnerable to weaker commodity prices in the event of slower growth in China. Global inflation remains benign amid relatively stable food and energy price trends. Financial markets appear to have priced in continued steady tapering of quantitative easing in the US, and recent guidance from the Fed appears to have reduced the degree of volatility and uncertainty in financial markets regarding the pace and timing of monetary policy normalisation. Policy rates look set to increase at a moderate pace in the US and UK during 2015, while the possibility exists of further easing in Japan and the Eurozone, where the risk of deflation persists. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, monetary policy has been tightened in New Zealand. Brazil and Russia in response to inflation pressures or exchange rate concerns, but eased slightly in Hungary. With global financial markets pricing in a slower pace of US policy normalisation, global risk appetite has improved. Apart from sizeable outflows from Russia in the wake of the crisis in the Ukraine, capital flows to emerging markets have resumed, or outflows slowed, resulting in generally appreciating EM currencies and declining long bond yields. This improved sentiment has also impacted on the rand exchange rate, which appreciated by 3,3 per cent against the dollar and by 3,1 per cent on a trade-weighted basis since the previous meeting of the 5. This improved sentiment has also impacted on the rand exchange rate, which appreciated by 3,3 per cent against the dollar and by 3,1 per cent on a trade-weighted basis since the previous meeting of the 5 MPC. During this period the rand traded in a range of between around R10,70 and R10,29 against the US dollar. Portfolio flows to South Africa have been in line with general global trends. Following cumulative net sales of South African government bonds and equities by non-residents of R71 bn from November 2013 to the end of January 2014, net purchases of bonds and equities since the beginning of February have totaled R8,3 bn and R29,9 bn respectively. Year-to-date net inflows into bonds and equities total R7,6 bn. While recent exchange rate developments have afforded some near-term respite from further inflation risks from the exchange rate, the MPC is mindful of the sensitivity of the rand to both global and domestic factors. The rand is expected to remain vulnerable to changing global perceptions of US monetary policy and associated capital flows. However, while the recent appreciation is more a reflection of changing global risk perceptions rather than a specific re-assessment of South African fundamentals, domestic factors have also impacted on the rand. The exchange rate is likely to remain sensitive to domestic factors, including developments in the current account of the balance of payments and perceptions of its sustainability. In particular, the ongoing strike in the platinum sector is expected to begin to have a significant negative impact on exports, now that inventories are reaching low levels, and a further extension of the strike could impede the required current account adjustment process. 6 The domestic economic growth outlook has deteriorated markedly, with the reversal of a number of the tentative positive signs observed at the beginning of the year. The Bank's forecast for economic growth for 2014 has been revised down from 2,6 per cent at the previous meeting to 2,1 per cent, implying a further widening of the negative output gap. The forecast for 2015 remains unchanged at 3,1 per cent, and growth in 2016 is expected to average 3,4 per cent. However, the risks to these forecasts are increasingly to the downside against the renewed possibility of electricity load-shedding, among other factors. The Bank's leading indicator of economic activity declined marginally in February, and the sustained sideways movement confirms the subdued outlook, amid weak business confidence. The RMB/BER business confidence index declined by two index points to 41 index points in the first quarter of 2014. The first quarter growth outcome was negatively affected by contractions in both the mining and manufacturing sectors. In the first quarter of 2014 the physical volume of mining production declined by 6,8 per cent (not annualised) when compared with the previous quarter. This decline was not confined to the platinum group metals, with production declining in seven of the twelve mining sub-components and expectations are for this negative trend to continue. The physical volume of manufacturing production declined by 1,6 per cent (not annualised) in the first quarter of the year. The contraction was also broad based 7. The contraction was also broad based 7 and the outlook for the sector remains subdued as reflected in the marked decline in the Kagiso PMI to 47,4 index points in April. This follows two consecutive months when the index was above 50 points. The new sales orders component of the PMI remained well below 50 for the second consecutive month. There appears to be continued underutilisation of manufacturing production capacity, particularly with respect to durable goods production. The favourable trend in the real value of building plans passed during the past two years has been maintained in keeping with rising levels of building confidence. The real value of building plans passed increased by 13,6 per cent on the 3-month-to-3-month basis in March 2014, and by 5,9 per cent on a year- on-year basis. The unemployment rate remained elevated at 25,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 in a declining growth environment. This follows a decline in employment in the first quarter of 2014 of 122,000 jobs, although on a seasonally adjusted basis the decrease was 32,000. Consumption expenditure by households is expected to remain constrained in the face of continued weakness in credit extension, rising inflation, high consumer indebtedness, as well as the knock-on effects of the mining strike, where the cumulative loss of wages is estimated to have exceeded R8 billion. Real retail sales grew by 0,6 per cent on a quarter-to-quarter basis in the first 8. Real retail sales grew by 0,6 per cent on a quarter-to-quarter basis in the first 8 quarter of this year, having declined in March by 1,4 per cent on a month-to- month basis. New vehicle sales declined by 0,7 per cent on a 3-month-to-3- month basis in April, and by over 10 per cent on a year-on-year basis while NAAMSA expects new vehicle sales to contract over the year. Although the FNB/BER consumer confidence index improved marginally in the first quarter of 2014, it remained at a low level of -6. Growth in bank credit extension to households continued to moderate, while that to companies has remained relatively robust. The twelve month growth in total loans and advances to the private sector measured 8,2 per cent in March 2014, driven by a 12,7 per cent increase in credit extension to companies, related in part to the awarding of a new round of renewable energy contracts. By contrast, growth in credit extension to households moderated further to 4,8 per cent, as unsecured lending continued its downward trend. Growth over twelve months in general loans to households, mainly made up of unsecured lending, measured 3,5 per cent in March, the lowest rate of growth since 2005. Growth in mortgage advances to households remained below 3 per cent, in line with the relatively subdued volume growth in the housing market. While growth in instalment sale and leasing finance recorded annual growth of 10,1 per cent in March, it is on a declining trend, particularly with respect to households. These trends in credit extension are expected to remain a constraint on consumption expenditure growth. 9 The trend in wage settlements is more or less unchanged. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements was unchanged from the previous year, at 7,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2014. However the main wage negotiations are yet to be completed, in particular the re-negotiation of a new multi-year agreement in the Steel and Engineering Bargaining Council. The outcome of this, as well as the impasse in the platinum sector, could have an important bearing on the general trend of wage settlements. Food prices remain a risk to the inflation outlook, although the risk may have moderated somewhat following the sharp reversal in domestic maize prices in recent weeks. Having reached a peak of almost R3,800 per ton in March, maize prices declined in May to around R2,000 per ton, and an 8 per cent decline over the year. This was in response to an upward revision of the domestic maize crop forecast, now expected to be 11 per cent higher than last year, which has resulted in a move from import to export parity prices. This development, if sustained, could help ameliorate the considerable pipeline pressures that have been evident in the producer price index since the beginning of the year. Final manufactured producer food price inflation accelerated to 9,1 per cent in March and further pressures are evident in the agricultural producer price inflation for cereals which measured 26,5 per cent in March, although this is expected to moderate in response to lower spot prices. 10 The international oil price has remained within the range of US$105-US$111 for some time. The domestic price of petrol has benefited from the stronger trend in the exchange rate over the past weeks. In May the price of 95 octane petrol declined by 15 cents per litre, following a 7 cent per litre increase in April, and, should current trends continue, a further reduction can be expected in June. The MPC continues to face the difficult dilemma of dealing with upside risks to inflation and a deteriorating domestic economic growth outlook. Although the breach of the upper end of the inflation target band was in line with the Bank's forecast, the risks to the forecast remain on the upside. The policy dilemma is increased by the fact that inflation is seen to be driven primarily by supply side factors, while demand conditions in the economy remain subdued. Although the immediate pressures from the exchange rate are lower than was the case earlier in the year, the exchange rate remains a significant source of upside risk to the forecast. The respite from the stronger exchange rate could be temporary and respond quickly to changes in both domestic and external conditions. Although the pass-through from the exchange rate to inflation is still relatively low, there are indications of some acceleration. In addition, food prices are expected to add further upside impetus to inflation in the near term, but this risk may have moderated to some extent given the sharp decline in the maize prices and low global food inflation. 11 As indicated earlier, the Bank's economic growth forecast for 2014 has been revised down significantly to 2,1 per cent, and the first quarter growth outcome is anticipated to be the lowest quarterly growth rate since the recession in 2009. Although growth in the second quarter is expected to improve somewhat, the risks to the 2014 growth forecast are strongly on the downside, with developments in the mining sector an ongoing cause for concern. The demand side of the economy is also weakening: household consumption expenditure growth continues to moderate amid slower credit extension to households, high levels of consumer debt levels and moderate job growth. However, the weak state of the economy cannot be resolved through monetary policy actions alone. The committee continues to hold the view that we are in a rising interest rate cycle, and interest rates will have to be normalised in due course. We embarked on this process with our first move in January 2014. At this stage the pace and timing of normalisation in the advanced economies appears to have been pushed out further and may be more moderate than previously believed. We are also aware that this can change very quickly. Accordingly, the committee decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,5 per cent per annum at this stage. Future actions will be data dependent and determined by developments in the inflation outlook and inflation expectations. Inflation is currently at uncomfortable 12. Inflation is currently at uncomfortable 12 levels and a marked deterioration in the outlook may require action that we will not hesitate to take. The MPC reiterates that a rising interest rate cycle does not mean that rates will be raised at each meeting, or by the same amount each time.

Israel,2014-05-26,"The CPI increased by only 0.1 percent in April, markedly lower thanexpectations, and the rate of inflation over the previous 12 months was 1 percent, the lower bound of the target range. This measure of the inflationrate is expected to decline in the coming months, to below the lower boundof the target range, though expectations for 1-year ahead are within the target range. Indicators of real economic activity which became available this month point to more moderate growth than assessed in the previous month, though the extent of the moderation is uncertain. The first estimate of first quarter data signals a slowdown in growth, due to a contraction of private consumption and fixed capital formation, while labor market data continue to indicate growth in employment and reduced unemployment, and there was improvement in indices of consumer confidence and of expectations of activity. Signs of moderation are also seen in Composite State of the Economy Index data,including goods exports. In the past month, the shekel weakened by 0.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, while since the beginning of 2014 the effective exchange rate has been stable, and it has appreciated by 4.4 percent over the past year. Against the background of disappointing first quarter growth data in the US and in Europe, the OECD reduced its 2014 global growth and world tradeprojections this month. Emerging market weakness continues to weigh on global growth. The probability of further monetary easing in Europe increased,and expectations remain that in the US, the federal funds rate will begin to be increased in the second half of 2015. Home prices continued to increase in February-March, and their annual rate of increase remains around 6-7 percent. The rate of mortgages taken out remains elevated, with continued decline in the risk characteristics of new mortgages. The increase in the number of building completions continues, but some slowdown is apparent in the number of building starts. This month, as well, there is continued uncertainty regarding the effect on housing market price levels and activity volume of the policy measures that the government decided upon. To view this press release as a Word document. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of thecontinuing uncertainty in both the global economy and economic activity inIsrael. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housingmarket. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for June 2014 will be published on June 9, 2014. The decision regarding the interest rate for July 2014 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. June 23, 2014. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April increased by 0.1 percent, markedly lower than forecasters' projections for an increase of 0.6 percent, on average, and previous years' AprilCPI figures. The increase in most components of the CPI was relatively low. The surprise in the CPI derived primarily from increases in the housing and clothing and footwear components that were more moderate than expected, as well as from an unexpected decline in the food component, for which the rate of increase has slowed in recent months. The inflation rate over the preceding 12 months was 1.0 percent, the lower bound of the inflation targetrange, compared with 1.3 percent over the 12 months ending in March. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Following the publication of the April CPI figure, inflation expectations for the coming year, fromall sources, declined. Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings are 1.3 percent on average. Inflation expectations for the coming year derived from the capital market are 1.5 percent, and expectations for the next 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates are 1.4 percent. Inflation expectations for medium and long terms remained slightly above the midpoint of the inflation target range, witha decline of about 10 basis points in the medium ranges. After the publication of the CPI data, there was an increase in the market's assessment of the probability of one interest rate reduction in the next three months, as reflected both in private forecasters' projections as well as the Telbor interest rate and makam curves. Real economic activity: The range of data that became availablethis month leaves a lack of clarity about the state of real activity. According to the first estimate of National Accounts data for the first quarter (seasonally adjusted, annual terms). GDP grew by 2.1 percent, and businesssector product grew by just 0.4 percent. The slowdown in growth was led bya contraction of 2 percent in private consumption, and a contraction of 9.8 percent in fixed capital formation (excluding ships and aircraft). In parallel, the estimated growth rate for the fourth quarter of 2013 was reviseddownward from 3.2 percent to 2.9 percent. It should be noted that the revision does not derive from a change in original data, but rather from a change in the seasonality coefficients, which are given to considerable subsequent volatility. Foreign trade data for April continue to indicate marked weakness in goods exports, which declined by 11 percent in April compared with March (monthly, seasonally adjusted data, excluding ships, aircraft and diamonds), and the trend of decline in its volume is strengthening. In contrast, services exports remained at an elevated level, and were 6.8 percent higher in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter (seasonally adjusted data, excluding startups). Trend data of goods imports continued to decline, with stability in consumer goods imports and a decline in the import of raw materials and capital goods. The Composite State of the Economy Index remained unchanged in April, with a decline in most of its components, most notably declines in goods exports, the import of manufacturing inputs, and in industrial production. Previous months' index readings were revised downward. In contrast, indices of consumer confidence and expectations of activity indicate a positive picture in April. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by Bank Hapoalim remained stable, and the index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics showed improvement. The Purchasing Managers Index increased to 51.4 points, signaling expectations of an expansion in manufacturing activity, derived mainly from domestic demand. The Climate Index based on the Business Tendency Survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics improved, and reflects a monthly growth rate of 0.29 percent. The labor market: Labor market data indicate improvement duringthe first quarter, which is not in line with the first National Accounts estimate indicating a slowdown in activity. Labor Force Survey data indicatea decline in the unemployment rate among the principal working ages (25-64) in the first quarter to 5.1 percent, with an increase in the participation rate (79.7 percent) and in the employment rate (75.7 percent). The overall unemployment rate remained stable at 5.8 percent. The number of employed persons increased by about 38,000 in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter (1.3 percent, seasonally adjusted). National Insurancedata indicate an increase of 28,000 employee posts in January-February. The two sources thus present a consistent picture of the labor market. Over the 12 months ending in February, the number of employee posts increased by 2.8 percent in public services and by 1 percent in the business sector, and the gap between the two sectors continues to narrow. Nominal wagesincreased by 0.2 percent, and real wages remained unchanged, in December-February, compared to the preceding three months (September-November, seasonally adjusted data). Health tax receipts by the NationalInsurance Institute, which provide an indication of total wage payments in the economy, were 5.4 percent higher in March-April, on a nominal basis, than in the corresponding two months of the previous year. Budget data: Since the beginning of 2014, the government's domestic deficit (excluding net credit) was NIS 0.4 billion, which is NIS 1.1 billion below the seasonal path consistent with meeting the deficittarget for 2014, mainly due to nonrecurring revenues received in January. Tax revenues increased in April. Direct tax revenues in January-April were 10 percent greater in real terms than in the corresponding period of last year, and indirect taxes received were similar to last year (net of legislative changes and nonrecurring revenues). Gross VAT receipts on domestic production, which serve as an indication of the level of activity in the economy, were 0.8 percent lower in April than the average monthly level in the first quarter, and it remains difficult to determine the extent to which this is a result of a decline in the number of new-home purchase transactions due to the government's expected policy measures. Based on trend data, domestic expenditures (excluding credit) increased by 0.8 percent from January through April, compared with September-December of 2013, a relatively low rate of growth compared with the pace until the middle of last year. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on April 27, 2014, through May 23, 2014, the shekel weakened by 0.6 percent against the dollar and appreciated by 1 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel weakened by about 0.4 percent this month. For the year to date, the effective exchange rate has remained essentially unchanged, and over the past 12 months it has appreciated by 4.4 percent. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on April 27, 2014, through May 23, 2014, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by 0.4 percent, similar to the trend on most markets worldwide. Government bond yields declined sharply all along the curves. The yield on 10-year unindexed bonds declined by about 40 basis points, to 2.94 percent. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and corresponding 10-year US Treasury securities narrowed to 47 basis points. Makam yields declined by about 15 basis points along the entire curve, and the 1-year yield is 0.54 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by thefive-year CDS spread declined slightly, to around 82 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in April, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 20.5 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 8.3 percent. Developments in the credit markets: Total outstanding debt of the business sector declined by about NIS 5 billion (0.7 percent) in March, to NIS 772 billion, primarily as a result of the repayment of tradable bonddebt, which was partly offset by loans from banks and institutional investors. Following a decline in bond issuances in March, the nonfinancial business sector issued bonds totaling NIS 2.6 billion, similar to the average in the past two years, while the spreads continued to decline to historicallylow levels. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 2.9 billion (0.7 percent) in March, to about NIS 412 billion at the end of the month. The increase derived from net debt raised and the increase in the CPI. In April, new mortgages taken out totaled about NIS 4 billion. The risk characteristics of new mortgages: the loan to value ratio, the payment to income ratio, the share of mortgages considered risky, and the share of mortgages granted at variable rate interest: declined in April, continuing their decline in 2013. In April, the interest rate on new mortgages on all tracks continued to decline, while the spreads between fixed interest rates and the yields on government bonds were maintained. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by only 0.1 percent in April. In the 12 monthsending in April, this component increased by 2.3 percent, compared with 3.2 percent over the 12 months ending in March. Home prices, which are measured in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased by 0.4 percent in February-March. Overthe 12 months ending in March, home prices increased by 7.1 percent, compared with an increase of 6.9 percent in the 12 months ended in February. In recent months a moderation in building starts is becoming apparent. In the 12 months ended in February, there were 42,500 building starts and 43,000 completions, marking the first time since 2007 that the annual quantity of building completions was greater than the number of starts. The global economy: Data which became available this month indicate that the global economy continues to recover, though apparently at a more moderate rate than previously assessed. This month, the OECD revised its 2014 global growth forecast downward by 0.2 percent, and the world trade forecast by 0.4 percent, with a slight upward revision of its 2015 projections. The US economy grew by only 0.1 percent in the first quarter, comparedwith the fourth quarter. Industrial production contracted by 0.6 percent in April. Personal consumption expenditure increased by 0.9 percent in March, and indicators from the credit market point to improved household economic security. A positive trend continued in the employment market, with a sharp increase of 288,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, and a decline in the unemployment rate to 6.3 percent. In the real estate market, there was a recovery in housing starts and in home prices, but in contrast there was a decline in demand for mortgages and in indices of contractor activity. Inflation surprised to the upside, but part of that is attributed to a drought in the first quarter which led to higher food prices. The Federal Reserve continues its tapering process as expected, and there is no change in the assessments that the federal funds rate will begin to be increased in the second half of 2015, after the Fed Chair noted that the labor market, despite its improvement, is far from satisfactory. In Europe, as well. GDP growth of 0.2 percent growth in the first quarter, compared with the fourth quarter, was disappointing. It derived primarily from a lack of growth in France andnegative growth in the Netherlands and in Italy, which were offset by growth of 0.8 percent in Germany. In contrast, the purchasing managers index declined in Germany and increased in the other countries, so that the overallindex for the eurozone remained unchanged. The credit survey indicates growth in demand for commercial and consumer credit, but actual data, according to which commercial credit contracted by 3.1 percent in the past year, point to a supply constraint on credit, likely affected by banking system stress tests. Inflation remains low, and the ECB announced its preparedness totake additional accommodative steps in June. In Japan, there was relatively high first quarter growth of 1.5 percent (in quarterly terms), against the background of household expenditures brought forward ahead of the VAT increase in April. In the second quarter, growth is expected to be negative. The OECD growth forecast for China in 2014 was reduced by 0.8 percent, to 7.4 percent, against the background of the deterioration in financial conditions and a slowdown in the real estate market. The weakness in emerging markets and in China continues, serving as the main risk to global growth. Oil and metals prices remained unchanged this month, while agricultural commodity prices declined slightly. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for June 2014 unchanged at 0.75 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: The CPI increased by only 0.1 percent in April, markedly lower thanexpectations, and the rate of inflation over the previous 12 months was 1 percent, the lower bound of the target range."
Hungary,2014-05-27,"At its meeting on 27 May, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 10 basis points from 2.50% to 2.40%, with effect from 28 May 2014. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening, output remains below potential and is likely to approach that level in the course of next year. With employment rising, the unemployment rate is falling, but still exceeds its long-term level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over the medium term. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation capturing the medium-term outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy, reflecting the effects of weak domestic demand and low inflation in external markets. The persistently low inflation environment may provide a firmer anchor for inflation expectations. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact, but demand-side disinflationary pressures are weakening as activity gathers pace. Data available since the Council's latest interest rate decision show that economic growth continued, as reflected in the 2014 Q1 preliminary GDP release as well as monthly data on industrial output, retail sales and the performance of construction. Growth is expected to pick up gradually in the quarters ahead and to return to a more balanced structure, with domestic demand likely to make an increasing contribution. Along with the Government's infrastructure projects using EU funding and rising corporate investment due to the Funding for Growth Scheme, the recovery in household consumption is likely to be gradual. The expansion in real incomes is expected to be partly offset by the ongoing reduction in debts accumulated in the years prior to the crisis and the slow easing in tight credit conditions. According to labour market data for March, demand for labour increased and unemployment fell, which may point to a tighter labour market going forward. Global investor sentiment has been supportive in the past month, but future developments are surrounded by uncertainty due to the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Domestic risk premia on balance fell and the forint exchange rate appreciated steadily in the past month. Hungary's persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt are reducing its vulnerability. The announcement by the MNB about its programme of self-financing may have also contributed to the improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy. In the Council's judgement, a cautious approach to policy is warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. In the Council's judgement, there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the policy horizon; however, achieving price stability in the medium term points in the direction of monetary easing. The improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy provided scope for a further cautious reduction in interest rates. The Monetary Council will decide on the need and possibility of reducing the base rate further after a comprehensive assessment of the macroeconomic outlook and developments in perceptions of the risks about the economy and in view of the baseline projection and alternative scenarios in the June issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation."
Egypt,2014-05-29,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release May 29, 2014 In its meeting held on May 29, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 825 percent, 925 percent, and 875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 875 percen. Headline CPI increased by 060 percent (m/m) in April compared to an increase of 068 percent (m/m) in March, while the annual rate decreased to 887 percent in April down from 982 percent recorded in the previous month, on the back of favorable base effec. While monthly developments in headline inflation have been largely driven by higher prices of several food items since the beginning of 2014. April marks the first month during which food prices have been relatively mute. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 025 percent (m/m) in April following an increase of 070 percent in March, while the annual rate decreased to 911 percent in April down from 990 in March on the back of favorable base effect from last yea. Upside risks to the inflation outlook continue to be contained as the possibility of a sharp rebound in international food prices is unlikely in light of recent global development. Meanwhile real GDP picked up slightly in 2013/2014 Q2, growing by 14 percent compared to the 104 percent recorded in the quarter ending September 201. This brought the annual growth for the first half of 2013/2014 to a feeble 12 percent compared to the growth rate of 21 percent recorded in 2012/201. Economic activity remained sluggish in 2013/2014 Q2 on the back of modest growth rates in most of the key sectors, namely manufacturing and construction in addition to the contraction in the tourism and petroleum sector. In the meantime, investment levels remained low given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants since early 2011 and the weak credit growth to the private secto. Looking ahead, downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. The downside risks to domestic GDP combined with the negative output gap since 2011 will limit upside risks to the inflation outlook going forwar. Given the mixed balance of risks surrounding the inflation and the GDP outlooks at this juncture. MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat Sub Governor.

India,2014-06-03,"Second Bi-Monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2014-15 By Dr.Raghuram G Rajan. Governor Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.0 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL); reduce the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks by 50 basis points from 23.0 per cent to 22.5 per cent of their NDTL with effect from the fortnight beginning June 14, 2014; reduce the liquidity provided under the export credit refinance (ECR) facility from 50 per cent of eligible export credit outstanding to 32 per cent with immediate effect; introduce a special term repo facility of 0.25 per cent of NDTL to compensate fully for the reduction in access to liquidity under the ECR with immediate effect; and continue to provide liquidity under 7-day and 14-day term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 9.0 per cent. Assessment 2. Since the first bi-monthly monetary policy statement of April 2014, global activity is evolving at different speeds. A broad-based strengthening of growth is gaining traction in the US and the UK, after a moderation in the first quarter of 2014 due to adverse weather conditions. However, in the euro area, recovery is struggling to gather momentum. The pick-up in sales in Japan in anticipation of the consumption tax hike has been followed by a sharp fall in consumer spending. Growth in coming quarters will depend on all three “arrows” being put in play. Structural constraints continue to impede growth prospects in emerging market economies (EMEs), with concerns about the slowdown in China as its economy rebalances. Financial markets across the world still remain vulnerable to news about the impending normalisation of interest rates in some developed economies, even as some valuations appear frothy.2 3. Lead indicators point to continuing sluggishness in domestic economic activity in the first quarter of 2014-15. The outlook for agriculture is clouded by the meteorological department's forecasts of a delay in the onset of the south-west monsoon with a 60 per cent chance of the occurrence of El Nino. The ongoing contraction in the production of consumer durables and capital goods, coupled with moderation in corporate sales and non-oil non-gold imports, is indicative of continuing weakness in both consumption and investment demand. The decisive election result, together with improved sentiment should, however, create a conducive environment for comprehensive policy actions and a revival in aggregate demand as well as a gradual recovery of growth during the course of the year. Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) increased for the second consecutive month in April, pushed up by a sharp spike in food inflation, especially in the prices of fruits, vegetables, sugar, pulses and milk. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has moderated gradually since September 2013 although it is still elevated. For the year 2013-14 as a whole. India's current account deficit (CAD) narrowed sharply to 1.7 per cent of GDP, primarily on account of a decline in gold imports, although other non-oil imports also contracted with the weakening of domestic demand, and there was some pick-up in exports. In April 2014, the trade deficit narrowed sharply due to resumption of export growth after two consecutive months of decline, and the ongoing shrinking of import demand. Robust inflows of portfolio investment, supported by foreign direct investment and external commercial borrowings, kept external financing conditions comfortable and helped add to reserves. With the unwinding of year-end window dressing, the corresponding decline in the size of excess CRR holding of banks as well as the sharp decline in Government cash balances with the Reserve Bank as a result of Government expenditure, liquidity conditions improved significantly in April and May 2014. The average daily access to liquidity from the LAF and term repos during this period has been close to 1.0 per cent of NDTL. The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor liquidity conditions and will actively manage liquidity to ensure adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors. Policy Stance and Rationale 7. In March and April. CPI headline inflation has risen on the back of a sharp increase in food prices. Some of this price pressure will continue into May, but it is largely seasonal. Moreover. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has been edging down. The risks to the central forecast of 8 per cent CPI inflation by January 2015 remain broadly balanced. Upside risks in the form of a sub-normal/delayed monsoon on account of possible El Nino effects, geo-political tensions and their impact on fuel prices, and uncertainties surrounding the setting of administered prices appear at this stage to be balanced by the possibility of stronger Government action on food supply and better fiscal consolidation as well as the pass through of recent exchange rate appreciation. Accordingly, at this juncture, it is appropriate to leave the policy rate unchanged, and to allow the disinflationary effects of rate increases undertaken during September 2013-January 2014 to mitigate inflationary pressures in the economy.3 8. The Reserve Bank remains committed to keeping the economy on a disinflationary course, taking CPI inflation to 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016. If the economy stays on this course, further policy tightening will not be warranted. On the other hand, if disinflation, adjusting for base effects, is faster than currently anticipated, it will provide headroom for an easing of the policy stance. Contingent upon the desired inflation outcome, the April projection of real GDP growth from 4.7 per cent in 2013-14 to a range of 5 to 6 per cent in 2014-15 is retained with risks evenly balanced around the central estimate of 5.5 per cent (Chart 2). The outlook for the agricultural sector is contingent upon the timely arrival and spread of the monsoon. Easing of domestic supply bottlenecks and progress in the implementation of stalled projects should brighten the outlook for both manufacturing and services. The resumption of export growth is a positive development and as world trade gathers momentum, the prospects for exports should improve further.4 10. In pursuance of the Dr.Urjit R. Patel Committee's recommendation to move away from sector-specific refinance towards a more generalised provision of system liquidity without preferential access to any particular sector or entity, the Reserve Bank has decided to limit access to export credit refinance while compensating fully with a commensurate expansion of the market's access to liquidity through a special term repo facility from the Reserve Bank (equivalent to 0.25 per cent of NDTL). This should improve access to liquidity from the Reserve Bank for the system as a whole without the procedural formalities relating to documentary evidence, authorisation and verification associated with the ECR. This should also improve the transmission of policy impulses across the interest rate spectrum and engender efficiency in cash/treasury management. As the economy recovers, investment demand and the need for credit will pick up. To the extent that this contributes eventually to supply, it is important that banks have the room to finance it. A reduction in the required SLR will give banks more freedom to expand credit to the non-Government sector. However, the Reserve Bank is also cognisant of the significant on-going financing needs of the Government. Therefore, the SLR is reduced by 0.50 per cent of NDTL, with any further change dependent on the likely path of fiscal consolidation 12. With a view to improving the depth and liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market, it has been decided to allow foreign portfolio investors to participate in the domestic exchange traded currency derivatives market to the extent of their underlying exposures plus an additional US$ 10 million. Furthermore, it has also been decided to allow domestic entities similar access to the exchange traded currency derivatives market. Detailed operating guidelines will be issued separately. As a prudential measure, the eligibility limit for foreign exchange remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) had been reduced to US$ 75,000 last year. In view of the recent stability in the foreign exchange market, it has been decided to enhance the eligible limit to US$ 125,000 without end use restrictions except for prohibited foreign exchange transactions such as margin trading, lottery and the like. Operating guidelines will be issued separately. At present, only Indian residents are allowed to take Indian currency notes up to 10,000 out of the country. Non-residents visiting India are not permitted to take out any Indian currency notes while leaving the country. With a view to facilitating travel requirements of non-residents visiting India, it has been decided to allow all residents and non-residents except citizens of Pakistan and Bangladesh to take out Indian currency notes up to 25,000 while leaving the country. Operating guidelines in this regard are being issued separately. The third bi-monthly monetary policy statement is scheduled on Tuesday. August 5, 2014.

Poland,2014-06-03,"Warsaw, 3 June 2014 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 2-3 June 2014 The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 2.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 4.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis;  bill rediscount rate at 2.75% on an annual basis; Growth in global economic activity remains moderate, although the economic situation varies across countries. In the United States, following a contraction in GDP in early 2014, indicators of economic activity have improved over recent months. In the euro area, weak recovery continues and GDP growth in 2014 Q1 was slower than expected. Monetary policy of the major central banks remains expansionary. The European Central Bank has indicated a possibility of further monetary policy easing in the near future. Activity growth remains slow relative to previous performance in the largest emerging market economies, including China and Russia, where it weakened. Moderate growth in global economic activity is conducive to maintaining low inflation in many countries. In recent months, inflation fell to near zero in the Central and Eastern Europe. In Poland. GDP growth in 2014 Q1 accelerated to 3.4% y/y, close to the March projection. An acceleration in economic growth was driven by faster investment growth and a slight acceleration in consumer demand. In April, industrial output growth stabilised, while construction and assembly output decelerated. At the same time, retail sales growth picked up. This was accompanied by moderate acceleration in lending growth, both to companies and households. The recovery has been translating into an improvement of labour market conditions. According to the Labour Force Survey, in 2014 Q1 employment growth in the Polish economy accelerated. This was conducive to a decline in unemployment, yet it remains elevated. Heightened unemployment restricts wage pressure in the economy. In April. CPI inflation fell substantially below the March projection, to 0.3%, i.e. markedly below the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. All core inflation measures also declined. This was accompanied by a further fall in producer prices and decline in inflation expectations. In the opinion of the Council, gradual economic recovery is likely to continue in the coming quarters, while inflationary pressure will remain very low. The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council maintains its assessment that NBP 1/2 interest rates should be kept unchanged until the end of the third quarter of 2014. More comprehensive assessment of monetary policy perspectives and potential adjustment of interest rates will be possible after the Council gets acquainted with incoming information, including the July NBP projection."
Euroarea,2014-06-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Rehn. In pursuing our price stability mandate, today we decided on a combination of measures to provide additional monetary policy accommodation and to support lending to the real economy. This package includes further reductions in the key ECB interest rates, targeted longer-term refinancing operations, preparatory work related to outright purchases of asset-backed securities and a prolongation of fixed rate, full allotment tender procedures. In addition, we have decided to suspend the weekly fine-tuning operation sterilising the liquidity injected under the Securities Markets Programme. The decisions are based on our economic analysis, taking into account the latest macroeconomic projections by Eurosystem staff, and the signals coming from the monetary analysis. Together, the measures will contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to 2%. Inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Looking ahead, the Governing Council is strongly determined to safeguard this anchoring. Concerning our forward guidance, the key ECB interest rates will remain at present levels for an extended period of time in view of the current outlook for inflation. This expectation is further underpinned by our decisions today. Moreover, if required, we will act swiftly with further monetary policy easing. The Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments within its mandate should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation. Let me now briefly describe the individual measures decided today. Further details will be published at 3.30 p.m. on the ECB's website. First, we decided to lower the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by 10 basis points to 0.15% and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 35 basis points to 0.40%. The rate on the deposit facility was lowered by 10 basis points to -0.10%. The negative rate will also apply to reserve holdings in excess of the minimum reserve requirements and certain other deposits held with the Eurosystem. Second, in order to support bank lending to households and non-financial corporations, excluding loans to households for house purchase, we will be conducting a series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). All TLTROs will mature in September 2018, i.e. in around 4 years. Counterparties will be entitled to borrow, initially, 7% of the total amount of their loans to the euro area non-financial private sector, excluding loans to households for house purchase, outstanding on 30 April 2014. Lending to the public sector will not be considered in this calculation. The combined initial entitlement amounts to some €400 billion. To that effect, two successive TLTROs will be conducted in September and December 2014. In addition, from March 2015 to June 2016, all counterparties will be able to borrow, quarterly, up to three times the amount of their net lending to the euro area non-financial private sector, excluding loans to households for house purchase, over a specific period in excess of a specified benchmark. Net lending will be measured in terms of new loans minus redemptions. Loan sales, securitisations and write-downs do not affect the net lending measure. The interest rate on the TLTROs will be fixed over the life of each operation, at the rate on the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations (MROs) prevailing at the time of take-up, plus a fixed spread of 10 basis points. Starting 24 months after each TLTRO, counterparties will have the option to make repayments. A number of provisions will aim to ensure that the funds support the real economy. Those counterparties that have not fulfilled certain conditions regarding the volume of their net lending to the real economy will be required to pay back borrowings in September 2016. In addition, the Governing Council decided to extend the existing eligibility of additional assets as collateral, notably under the additional credit claims framework, at least until September 2018. Third, the Governing Council decided to intensify preparatory work related to outright purchases in the ABS market to enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Under this initiative, the Eurosystem will consider purchasing simple and transparent asset-backed securities with underlying assets consisting of claims against the euro area non-financial private sector, taking into account the desirable changes in the regulatory environment, and will work with other relevant institutions to that effect. Fourth, in line with our forward guidance and our determination to maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation, as well as to contain volatility in money markets, we decided to continue conducting the MROs as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period ending in December 2016. Furthermore, we decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to be allotted before the end of the reserve maintenance period ending in December 2016 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. In addition, we decided to suspend the weekly fine-tuning operation sterilising the liquidity injected under the Securities Markets Programme. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP in the euro area rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of this year. This confirmed the ongoing gradual recovery, while the outcome was somewhat weaker than expected. Most recent survey results signal moderate growth also in the second quarter of 2014. Looking ahead, domestic demand should continue to be supported by a number of factors, including the accommodative monetary policy stance, ongoing improvements in financing conditions working their way through to the real economy, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, and gains in real disposable income resulting from falls in energy prices. At the same time, although labour markets have shown some further signs of improvement, unemployment remains high in the euro area and, overall, unutilised capacity continues to be sizeable. Moreover, the annual rate of change of MFI loans to the private sector remained negative in April and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors are likely to continue to weigh on the pace of the economic recovery. This assessment of a moderate recovery is also reflected in the June 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.0% in 2014, 1.7% in 2015 and 1.8% in 2016. Compared with the March 2014 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for real GDP growth for 2014 has been revised downwards and the projection for 2015 has been revised upwards. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. Geopolitical risks, as well as developments in emerging market economies and global financial markets, may have the potential to affect economic conditions negatively. Other downside risks include weaker than expected domestic demand and insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries, as well as weaker export growth. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.5% in May 2014, after 0.7% in April. On the basis of the information available to us at today's meeting, annual HICP inflation is expected to remain at low levels over the coming months, before increasing only gradually during 2015 and 2016, thereby underpinning the case for today's decisions. Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Looking ahead, the Governing Council is strongly determined to safeguard this anchoring. Our assessment has been supported by the June 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. In the last quarter of 2016, annual HICP inflation is projected to be 1.5%. In comparison with the March 2014 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the projections for inflation for 2014, 2015 and 2016 have been revised downwards. It should be stressed that the projections are conditional on a number of technical assumptions, including exchange rates and oil prices, and that the uncertainty surrounding each projection increases with the length of the projection horizon. The Governing Council sees both upside and downside risks to the outlook for price developments as limited and broadly balanced over the medium term. In this context, we will closely monitor the possible repercussions of geopolitical risks and exchange rate developments. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for April 2014 continue to point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (M3). Annual growth in M3 moderated further to 0.8% in April, from 1.0% in March. The growth of the narrow monetary aggregate M1 moderated to 5.2 % in April, after 5.6% in March. In the recent past, the increase in the MFI net external asset position, reflecting in part the continued interest of international investors in euro area assets, has been the main factor supporting annual M3 growth. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.7% in April 2014, compared with -3.1% in March. Weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.4% in April 2014, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis led the Governing Council to decide on a combination of measures to provide further monetary policy accommodation and to support lending to the real economy. In order to strengthen the economic recovery, banks and policy-makers in the euro area must step up their efforts. Against the background of weak credit growth, the ongoing comprehensive assessment of banks' balance sheets is of key importance. Banks should take full advantage of this exercise to improve their capital and solvency position, thereby contributing to overcome any existing credit supply restriction that could hamper the recovery. At the same time, policy-makers in the euro area should push ahead in the areas of fiscal policies and structural reforms. As regards fiscal policies, the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections indicate continued progress in restoring sound public finances in the euro area. The aggregate euro area general government deficit is projected to decline gradually from 3.0% of GDP in 2013 to 2.5% of GDP in 2014. For 2015 and 2016, a further decline to 2.3% and 1.9 %, respectively, is projected. General government debt is projected to peak at 93.4% of GDP this year. Thereafter, it is projected to decline, reaching around 91% in 2016. As regards structural reforms, important steps have been taken to increase the competitiveness and the adjustment capacity of countries' labour and product markets, although progress has been uneven and is far from complete. In this context, the Governing Council takes note of the European Commission's recommendations on fiscal and structural policies, published on 2 June 2014, to continue the path of reducing budgetary and macroeconomic imbalances. The recommendation to the Council to abrogate the excessive deficit procedures for four euro area countries indicates continued progress in restoring sound public finances. However, euro area countries should not unravel progress made with fiscal consolidation. A full and consistent implementation of the euro area's macroeconomic surveillance framework, together with the necessary policy actions by euro area countries, will help to raise potential growth, increase the euro area's resilience to shocks and facilitate job creation."
Chile,2014-06-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 12 June 2014 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy meeting at 4% annual. Internationally, incoming information confirms the outlook of recovery of the developed economies, while projections of moderate growth in emerging markets are maintained. External financial conditions continued to improve in the last month. With respect to commodity prices, increased fuel prices stand out, while agricultural and copper prices have declined. Inflation remains bounded in the developed world, which has triggered additional monetary stimulus measures in the Eurozone. Local economic indicators confirm the low dynamism of output and demand. The drop in investment was compounded by a slowdown in private consumption. Despite signs of less dynamism in the labor market, the unemployment rate remains low. May's inflation was 4.7% annually. The y-o-y variation in core inflation measures and nominal wages picked up in the last month. Medium-term inflation expectations remain around 3% annually. The most likely scenario assumes that the rise in inflation — associated with the peso depreciation, among other factors— is a temporary development, which will be monitored with special attention. The Board will consider the possibility of making additional cuts to the monetary policy rate in line with the evolution of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions and its implications on the inflationary outlook. At the same time, the Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2014-06-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to have continued to ease, while economic growth trends in some emerging market countries have weakened somewhat. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance and by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries. In Korea, despite exports having sustained their buoyancy the Committee appraises the economic recovery to have shown signs of slowing, as domestic demand has slackened somewhat due largely to the impact of the Sewol ferry accident. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has shown an uptrend similar to its level of recent years, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for the time being going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will gradually narrow. Consumer price inflation rose from 1.5% the previous month to 1.7% in May, due mainly to the narrowing of the extents of decline in agricultural and petroleum product prices. Core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products fell slightly, from 2.3% to 2.2%. The Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, although it will remain low for the time being. Regarding the housing market, the uptrends of sales and leasehold deposit prices in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and in the rest of the country slowed. In the domestic financial markets, influenced by expectations of continued accommodative monetary policies in major countries and by inflows of foreigners' securities investment funds, stock prices have risen, long-term market interest rates have fallen, and the Korean won has appreciated. Looking ahead, while paying close attention to external risk factors such as shifts in major countries' monetary policies, and closely monitoring the movements in domestic demand following the Sewol ferry accident, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while supporting the continued recovery of economic growth."
Peru,2014-06-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2014 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.0 percent. This level of the reference rate is compatible with an inflation forecast converging to the target range in 2014 and to 2 percent in 2015. The decision of maintaining the monetary policy rate takes into account that: inflation expectations remain anchored within the inflation target range; GDP has been recording lower growth rates than the country's potential level of growth, which is expected to be a temporary situation; recent indicators show mixed signals of recovery in the world economy, and the supply factors that led inflation to increase are becoming more moderate. Inflation in May showed a rate of 0.23 percent and thus inflation in the last 12 months rose from 3.52 percent in April to 3.56 percent in May, as reflected in the price rise of some food products due to seasonal factors. The rate of inflation without food and energy was 0.14 percent. As a result of this, the rate of inflation in the last 12 months accumulated 2.82 percent. Inflation is forecast to remain initially close to the upper band of the target range due to the persistent effect of the supply shocks and to converge thereafter to the 2 percent target. Current and advanced indicators of activity show a temporary weakening in economic activity, with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output due mainly to the lower dynamism observed in investment and exports. The BCRP has continued reducing the rate of required reserves in domestic currency in June, lowering it from 12.0 percent to 11.5 percent with the purpose of supporting the dynamism of credit in soles. This rate reduction is effective as of July. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, and will implement additional monetary easing measures if it is necessary. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 2.80 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for July on its meeting of July 10, 2014."
Russia,2014-06-16,"On 16 June 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to maintain the Bank of Russia key rate at 7.5 percent per annum.In case existing inflation risks materialise, and threats to medium-term inflation targets emerge, the Bank of Russia will continue increasing the key rate.Significant inflation acceleration in February-May 2014 was prompted by a number of unforeseen factors, i.e. the considerable impact of exchange rate dynamics on consumer prices, as well as unfavourable conditions in the markets for some goods. Taking into account that monetary policy influence on the economy is distributed over time, inflation slowing to the 5.0% target in 2014 is unlikely. However, maintaining current monetary policy stance will ensure a slowdown in consumer price inflation to the target levels in the medium term. The annual rate of consumer price growth is estimated at 7.6% as of 9 June 2014. Core inflation increased to 7.0% in May 2014. The main reason for inflation acceleration is the effect of the observed rouble depreciation on prices of a wide range of goods and services. Moreover, there were a number of specific factors affecting the markets for some food items and boosting their prices. Against this backdrop, household inflation expectations rose, which also had an impact on consumer prices. So far the rise of the Bank of Russia key rate has had a small effect on bank lending and deposit rates, as well as on volumes of these operations. In March-April lending and rouble deposit rates slightly increased. However, rouble deposit growth rates continued to decline while lending growth rates, in contrast, kept increasing. The ongoing economic slowdown does not have a considerable restraining effect on consumer price growth since it is caused largely by structural factors. Historically low unemployment rate constrains economic growth potential. Due to demographic trends the impact of this factor will persist in the long run. Utilisation of commercially viable production capacity remains high. Labour productivity growth is sluggish, while fixed capital investment continues to contract because of declining profits in the real sector, limited access to long-term financing in both international and domestic markets, as well as low producer and consumer confidence. Uncertainty about international political situation also hampers production and investment. Besides, weak economic activity in most countries, which are Russia's trading partners, restrains the economic growth in Russia. At the same time, persistently high oil prices have a stabilising effect on the domestic economy and public finance. Consumer demand remains the main driver of economic growth. However, in April there were some signals of its decline following a temporary increase in previous months on the back of price growth expectations. According to the Bank of Russia projections, in 2014 economic growth will slow down to 0.4%. Boost to economy from the observed rouble depreciation will be limited. Amid economic uncertainty and declining producer confidence this year there is a high probability of a reduction in fixed capital investment. The combination of slowdown in real wages growth and a decline in household lending growth rates will have a dampening effect on consumer activity. Net exports will make a positive contribution to economic growth. In the second half of 2014, economic growth is expected to accelerate slightly against the backdrop of alleviated geopolitical tension and improving producer sentiment. Rouble depreciation in late 2013 — early 2014 will continue affecting consumer prices in the coming months. Nevertheless, given the stabilisation in the foreign exchange market in April — early June 2014, the contribution of exchange rate dynamics to inflation will decline. In the second half of the year, lower planned increases in administered prices and tariffs, low demand pressure due to the aggregate output of goods and services remaining below potential, as well as good expected harvest will also facilitate a slowdown in consumer price growth. In turn, lower inflation will contribute to a decline in inflation expectations. Taking into account that the observed acceleration in consumer price growth was prompted by unforeseen factors, while monetary policy influence on the economy is distributed over time, inflation slowing to the target level of 5.0% in 2014 is unlikely. However, maintaining current monetary policy stance will ensure a slowdown in consumer price inflation to the target levels in the medium term. Still, the risk of inflation exceeding the target remains high not only in the short term but also in the medium term. That risk is related to rouble exchange rate dynamics affected by, inter alia, monetary policy measures of the foreign central banks and geopolitical situation. Other sources of risk are inflation expectations dynamics, conditions in the food commodities markets as well as a possible revision of planned changes in administered prices. If these risks materialise and it puts medium-term inflation targets under threat, the Bank of Russia will continue increasing the key rate. The next meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors on the key rate is scheduled for25 July 2014. The press-release on the Bank of Russia Board of Directors' decision is to be published at 13:30. Moscow time. Interest rates on the Bank of Russia major operations1.

Georgia,2014-06-18,"18.06.14 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate unchanged at 4.00%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on June 18, 2014 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 4 percent. At a February meeting the MPC started a gradual exit from accommodative monetary policy. The speed of the exit depends on the rate of recovery of economic activity and aggregate demand. National Bank still considers the exit out of accommodative policy necessary. However, the recent forecasts suggest that the process will take more time than originally planned. Hence, in order to ensure that inflation reaches its target in the medium term, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this stage. The NBG forecasts indicate a gradual increase in inflation and it is expected to reach its 5-6% target value in the second half of 2014. Annual inflation in May 2014 was 2.4%. The recent period has shown a decreasing trend in export growth, indicating the weakening in external demand. One should also emphasize the low growth of credit activity, reflected in insufficient growth of domestic demand. Economic revival at a less than expected rate is the main risk factor for achieving the target inflation. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets both domestically and abroad and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure the price stability. The dynamics of further changes in monetary policy will depend on the dynamics of expected inflation, tendencies in economic growth, global and regional economic environment. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on August 13, 2014."
Philippines,2014-06-18,"Statement by BSP Governor Amando M Tetangco. Jr. At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy rates at3.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 5.5 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs and RPs were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were left unchanged as well. At the same time, the Monetary Board decided to raise the interest rate on the Special Deposit Account (SDA) facility by 25 basis points from 2.0 percent to 2.25 percent across all tenors effective immediately. The Monetary Board's decision to maintain the policy rates at their current levels is based on its assessment that the future inflation path is likely to stay within target over the policy horizon. Although the latest baseline inflation forecasts have risen due to the higher inflation outturn in May and the inclusion of the potential impact of El Niño on food and utility prices, inflation is projected to settle within the upper half of the target ranges of 4±1 percent for 2014 and 3±1 percent for 2015. Moreover, inflation expectations continue to be within the target bands for 2014 and 2015. Meanwhile, the balance of risks to the inflation outlook remains tilted toward the upside, with potential price pressures emanating from the possible uptick in food prices as a result of changing weather conditions, and pending petitions for adjustments in power rates. At the same time, the Monetary Board decided to adjust the SDA rate to counter risks to price and financial stability that could emanate from ample liquidity, noting that a modest upward adjustment in interest rates would be prudent amid robust credit growth. The Monetary Board believes that solid domestic growth prospects allow some scope for a measured adjustment in the SDA rate to ensure that monetary and credit conditions continue to be appropriate. Going forward, the BSP will remain vigilant against a potential build-up in inflation expectations and financial imbalances. The BSP stands ready to undertake further policy actions as necessary to safeguard price and financial stability."
Thailand,2014-06-18,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 18 June 2014 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 18 June 2014 as follows. The global economic recovery, led by major economies, retained its momentum. The US continued to grow on the back of stronger labour and housing markets. Recovery in the euro area and Japan continued at a moderate pace. In China, risks in the financial sectors subsided, while the downside risks to growth diminished in the short term. Asian economies remained stable, with exports partially offsetting slowing domestic demand. The Thai economy contracted in the first quarter of 2014 as political uncertainties weighed on domestic demand and tourism. Moderate recovery in exports of goods could not compensate for falling domestic demand. Following a significant reduction of political uncertainties, the economy should benefit from improving public and private spending. slow recovery in exports of goods and tourism however pose downside risks to growth. Meanwhile inflationary pressure has edged higher. In the committee's view, the economic recovery should pick up pace given reduced political uncertainties and a resumption of functioning public policy management. More active fiscal policy and prevailing monetary policy accommodation should lend support to a sustained economic recovery. The committee thus voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 200 percent per annum. The MPC will closely monitor economic and financial developments, and will pursue appropriate policy to ensure a sustained recovery as well as long‐term financial stability."
United States,2014-06-18,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indicates that growth in economic activity has rebounded in recent months. Labor market indicators generally showed further improvement. The unemployment rate, though lower, remains elevated. Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment resumed its advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in July, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $15 billion per month rather than $20 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $20 billion per month rather than $25 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

Israel,2014-06-23,"The CPI increased by 0.1 percent in May. Inflation measured over the preceding 12 months is at the lower bound of the target range, but is expected to decline below the lower bound in the coming months. With that, 1-year expectations from all sources are within the target range, and expectations for longer terms are around the midpoint of the target. The picture of real activity seen in the data and indicators which became available this month points to the economy continuing to grow at a moderate rate, similar to that of the second half of 2013. National Accounts data for the first quarter were revised upward, but there are signs of moderation in the growth of private consumption, and the virtual standstill in goods exports continues against the background of moderation in world trade. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.2 percent, and most indices of confidence and expectations improved this month. In the past month, the shekel strengthened by 1.3 percent against the dollar and by 1.4 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel strengthened by about 1.4 percent this month, and by about 1.2 percent for the year to date. The World Bank reduced its 2014 global growth forecast this month, primarily against the background of first quarter data in the US. The ECB adopted several accommodative monetary measures this month, while in the US the tapering process continues, and in the UK, the Bank of England provided a first indication that it is likely that with the recovery, there will be an increase in the interest rate by the end of 2014. Home prices continued to increase in March-April, and their annual rate of increase rose above 8 percent. The rate of new mortgages taken out remained elevated, while risk characteristics of new mortgages remainedstable after they declined due to steps taken by the Supervisor of Banks. In the first quarter of the year, there was a slowdown in building starts and completions, as well as in the number of transactions. Notwithstanding aslight increase this month, corporate bond spreads have been at a low level for a long time. To view this press release as a Word document. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for July 2014 will be published on July 7, 2014. The decision regarding the interest rate for August 2014 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. July 28, 2014. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May increased by 0.1 percent, slightly lower than forecasters' projections for an increase of 0.2 percent, on average. There were marked increases in the housing component, the education, culture, and entertainment component, andthe furniture component, while the clothing and footwear component declined notably. The inflation rate over the preceding 12 months was 1.0 percent: the lower bound of the inflation target range: as it was in the previous month. The main components that supported inflation were housing and energy, which together contributed about 0.9 percent to the increase in the CPI over the past year. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings increased slightly to 1.4 percent on average. Inflation expectations for the coming year derived from the capital market increased to 1.6 percent, though in the recent period there has been a difficulty in calculating 1-year expectations due to the lack of CPI-indexed bond series for that range. Expectations for the next 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates declined to 1.1 percent. Inflation as measured over the preceding 12 months is expected to be below the lower bound of the target range for several months, afterthe June 2013 CPI reading, which increased sharply due to the VAT increasethat month, is taken out of the calculation. Inflation expectations for medium terms increased slightly, after a decline of about 30 basis points at the end of the previous month, while longer term expectations remained stable at around 2.2 percent. Forecasters' projections regarding the Bank of Israel interest rate, and assessments reflected in the Telbor and makam yield curves, still indicate a probability of one interest rate reduction in the next three months, though there was a slight decline in that probability compared with the previous month. Real economic activity: There was a revision upward in NationalAccounts data in the second estimate for the first quarter (seasonally adjusted, annual terms): GDP grew by 2.7 percent (compared with 2.1 percent in the first estimate), business sector product increased by 1.5 percent (compared with 0.4 percent), private consumption declined by 0.6 percent (compared with decline of 2 percent), and goods and services exports (excluding diamonds and startups) increased by 11 percent (compared with a decline of 4.4 percent). Foreign trade data for May indicate a virtual standstill in goods exports, with a slight improvement in high technology exports and a deterioration in exports by low technology industries; this standstill is in line with that of world trade, as measured by several indices. In thecurrent account of the balance of payments (seasonally adjusted) there wasa relatively large surplus in the first quarter of $3.5 billion, but the goods and services account (surplus exports) contributed only $0.7 billion to the increase in the surplus relative to the fourth quarter. Goods imports (excluding ships and aircraft, diamonds, and fuels) increased in May by 2 percent (seasonally adjusted): with an increase in imports of consumer goods and raw materials, and a decline in imports of capital goods: though they have been stable over time. In April, supermarket chain turnover improved, which may indicate that the decline in consumption in the first quarter is not developing into a trend. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.2 percent in May. Indices of consumer confidence and of expectations of activity continue to indicate a positive picture: the Purchasing Managers Index increased in May to 55.6 points, signaling, for the second consecutive month, an expansion in activity; the Consumer Confidence indices compiled by Bank Hapoalim and by the Central Bureau of Statistics showed slight improvement in May. The Climate Index, based on the Business Tendency Survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics, has been stable in recent months, and indicates a monthly growth rate of 0.27 percent. The labor market: Labor Force Survey data for March-April indicate a halt in the trend of improvement in the employment situation among the principal working ages (25-64): the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage point in April to 5.2 percent, and the employment rate declined by 0.2 percentage points to 75.4 percent. With that, the overall unemployment rate remained stable at 5.7 percent, and the employment rate increased by 0.1 percentage point to 60.4 percent, so that in the overall population the improvement continued. The number of employed persons declined by about 6,700 (0.2 percent) in March, spread across most industries. Over the 12 months ending in March, the number of employee posts increased by 3.3 percent in public services and by 1.4 percent in the business sector, and the gap between the two sectors continues to narrow. Nominal wages declined by 0.1 percent, and real wages remained unchanged, in January-March, compared to the preceding three months (October-December,seasonally adjusted data). Health tax receipts by the National Insurance Institute, which provide an indication of total wage payments in the economy, were 4.9 percent higher in April-May, on a nominal basis, than in the corresponding two months of the previous year. Budget data: Since the beginning of 2014, the surplus in the government's domestic activity (excluding net credit) was NIS 1.9 billion, which is about NIS 3.3 billion above the seasonal path consistent with meeting the deficit target for 2014, mainly due to underspending and to nonrecurring revenues received in the beginning of the year. Tax revenues inMay were 10.5 percent greater in real terms than in May last year (excluding one-time revenues in May 2013). Gross domestic VAT receipts, net of legislative changes, were 2.5 percent greater in real terms in April-May than in the corresponding period of last year. Domestic expenditures (excluding credit) in January-May were 3.5 percent higher, in nominal terms, than in the corresponding period of the year before, reflecting, as noted, underspending relative to the seasonal path. The Research Department staff forecast: This month the ResearchDepartment updated its macroeconomic forecast. A notice about the updated forecast is being published concurrently with this release. According to the revised forecast, the inflation rate over the coming four quarters (until the second quarter of 2015) will be 1.6 percent. The Bank ofIsrael interest rate is expected, according to the Research Department forecast, to be 0.75 percent by the end of 2014, and is expected to increase during 2015 so that it is 1.5 percent at the end of that year. GDP in 2014 is projected to grow by 2.9 percent (3.1 percent in the previous forecast), and excluding the effect of natural gas production, growth is expected to be 2.6 percent (2.8 percent in the previous forecast). In 2015. GDP is expected to grow by 3 percent, similar to the previous forecast. Natural gas production is expected to stabilize and thus is not expected to contribute to growth in that year. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on May 25, 2014, through June 20, 2014, the shekel strengthened by 1.3 percent against the dollar and by 1.4 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel strengthened by about 1.4 percent this month. For the year to date, the effective exchange rate has strengthened by about 1.2 percent. On global markets the dollar traded mixed this month. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on May 25, 2014, through June 20, 2014, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increasedby 0.2 percent, lower than the trend of increase on most markets worldwide. With that, for the year to date, the return on the index has been very similar to that in major markets such as the US and Europe. Both the unindexed and CPI-indexed yield curves of government bonds flattened this month, similar to the trend worldwide, with yields increasing by up to 10 basis points for terms of up to 5 years, and yields declining by a similar amount on longer terms. The yield on 10-year unindexed bonds declined by about 10 basis points, to 2.86 percent. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and corresponding 10-year US Treasury securities narrowed to 25 basis points. Makam yields increased by about 6 basis points along the entire curve, and the 1-year yield is 0.61 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread declined slightly, to around 78 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in May, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 19.6 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 7.2 percent. Developments in the credit markets: Total outstanding debt of the business sector increased by about NIS 4.4 billion (0.6 percent) in April, to NIS 780 billion, primarily as a result of an increase in bank credit.In May, the nonfinancial business sector issued bonds totaling NIS 11.7 billion, primarily due to a large issue by a company in the energy industry, and notwithstanding a slight increase this month, spreads have been at the low level for a long time. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 0.9 billion (0.2 percent) in April, to about NIS 414 billion at the end of the month, as a result of a NIS 1.6 billion increase in housing credit and a decline of NIS 0.7 billion in nonhousing credit. In May, new mortgages taken out totaled about NIS 4.5 billion, so that monthly new mortgage volume is stable at its elevated level, while risk characteristics of new mortgages remained stable after they declined due to steps taken by the Supervisor of Banks. The interest rate on new mortgages taken out in May was similarto that of April, except on fixed interest rate. CPI-indexed loans, on which it declined by 12 basis points against the background of a similar decline in government bond yields. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.3 percent in May. In the 12 months endingin May, this component increased by 2.3 percent, a similar increase to that for the 12 months ending in April. Home prices, which are measured in theCentral Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased by 0.7 percent in March-April, and data from previous months were revised upward. Over the 12 months ending in April, homeprices increased by 8.3 percent, compared with an increase of 7.6 percent in the 12 months ended in March. In recent months, a moderation in buildingstarts is becoming apparent. In the 12 months ended in March, there were 43,400 building starts and 42,400 building completions, but first quarter data were lower than in preceding quarters. The number of transactions, afterincreasing in the final quarter of 2013, declined in the first quarter of 2014. The global economy: After the IMF and the OECD revised their 2014 growth forecasts in previous months, the World Bank revised its forecastthis month, from 3.2 percent to 2.8 percent, against the background of a lowered growth forecast for the US, primarily due to first quarter data. Projected growth in world trade was reduced from 4.6 percent to 4.1 percent, but the 2015 forecasts remained essentially unchanged. This month, the ECB adopted several accommodative monetary measures: the base interest rate was reduced from 0.25 percent to 0.15 percent, and thus the interest rate on commercial banks' deposits (for deposits not made due to regulatory reserve requirements) declined to a negative level (-0.1 percent), and the bank launched a new program, under which banks will be able to borrowat a fixed rate of interest for terms of 4 years in order to encourage providing loans to the business sector, and announced that it will examine thepossibility of carrying out an asset-backed security purchase program. Following these steps, the trend of decline in yields on bonds of countries atEurope's periphery continued, primarily in long-term bonds, and the euro weakened only moderately against the dollar. Macro data which were published this month in Europe indicate continued moderate growth, and the ECB revised downward its growth and inflation forecasts for 2014. First quarter growth data in the US were revised sharply downward, from 0.1 percent to a rate of -1.0 percent, and the Fed's forecast for 2014 was reduced from 2.9 percent to 2.2 percent, while the 2015 and 2016 projections remained unchanged. The tapering process continues as expected and the federalfunds rate is still only expected to be raised in 2015. Macro data in the US this month were mixed. In the labor market, the number of jobs returned,for the first time, to the level prior to the crisis, but did not keep pace with the increase in the working-age population, and thus the labor forceparticipation rate remains at a very low level. In Japan, first quarter data indicate that growth was stronger than assessments to date, but at the same time it appears that the VAT increase negatively impacted second quarter activity to a greater degree than expected. In the UK, the Bank of England gave the first indications that it is likely that with the recovery, there would be an increase in the interest rate at the end of 2014. In emergingmarkets, concerns over the effects of the tapering process eased and some optimism was seen in light of the ECB's steps. With that, the WorldBank's forecast for their growth in 2014 was reduced to 4.8 percent, from 5.3 percent. In China, mostly positive data were published this month, and authorities are taking various steps in order to attempt to guide credit market developments. The price of a barrel of oil increased by 3.4 percent this month, against the background of tension in Iraq, and prices of metals and agricultural commodities declined. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for July 2014 unchanged at 0.75 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: The CPI increased by 0.1 percent in May. The World Bank reduced its 2014 global growth forecast this month, primarily against the background of first quarter data in the US. The ECB adopted several accommodative monetary measures this month, while in the US the tapering process continues, and in the UK, the Bank of England provided a first indication that it is likely that with the recovery, there will be an increase in the interest rate by the end of 2014. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for July 2014 will be published on July 7, 2014."
Armenia,2014-06-24,"Press Release 24.06.2014 Interest rate lowered, to 7.00 percent In the June 24, 2014 Meeting, the Board of the CBA decided to lower the Refinancing Rate of the CBA by 0.25 pp to 7.00 percent. There was 0.8 percent of deflation in May of 2014, in relation to an unchanged price level recorded in the same month of the previous year, with the 12-month inflation of 3.6 percent in late May. In the coming months, the Board considers, the inflation rate will keep on easing as the impact of energy prices, increased in July 2013, phases out, and it will further pace down the lower bound of the confidence band most probably during the third quarter. The Board admits that uncertainties in the external sector in connection with global economic outlook and growth perspectives in trade partners are persisting amidst geopolitical developments even though inflationary pressures from the external sector are not discernable yet. The Board estimates that, based on the first half 2014 results, the economic growth remains within the projection. Relative sluggishness in industry and a slow pace with which construction recovers were offset by higher-than-expected growth in agriculture and services. An expansionary fiscal policy expected from the second half of 2014 as well as the monetary conditions which the CBA has eased will lead to a broadening aggregate demand and rebounding inflation rates. As a result, in the fourth quarter the 12-month inflation rate will increase and rest within the lower bound of the band by the end of the year. In such a situation, the Board finds it reasonable to continue easing the monetary conditions by cutting the refinancing rate. The Board agrees that future economic developments in both external and domestic environments may prompt the CBA to adjust the directions of the monetary policy, while attempting to attain the inflation target in the medium run. More information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Interest Rate Minutes) due on July 4th, 2014. Press Service of the Central Bank."
Turkiye,2014-06-24,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 12 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been kept at 11.5 percent, and borrowing rate has been kept at 8 percent. b) One-week repo rate has been reduced from 9.5 percent to 8.75 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been kept at 13.5 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. In line with these developments, recent data indicate to a modest course in private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, with the help of the recovery in foreign demand, exports contribute positively to economic growth. The Committee expects that such a demand composition will support disinflation and will lead to a significant improvement in the current account balance in 2014. The adverse impact of exchange rate developments since mid-2013 on annual inflation will gradually taper off. With the contribution of base effects, inflation is expected to decline markedly starting from this month. In light of these assessments and the recent improvement in global liquidity conditions, the Committee decided to deliver a measured cut in the one-week repo rate. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Czech Republic,2014-06-26,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna, is unchanged.. This decision is based on the message of the current forecast and on an assessment of newly available information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. The forecast expects market interest rates to be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate to stay close to CZK 27 to the euro until the start of next year. According to the forecast, however, the return to conventional monetary policy will not imply appreciation of the exchange rate to the level recorded before the CNB started intervening, because the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to the price level and other nominal variables. New data point to a slightly anti-inflationary balance of risks to the current forecast and, overall, they further increase the need for a later exit from the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument. In line with this, the Bank Board stated at its meeting today that the Czech National Bank would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2015 Q2, and it did not rule out a further shift of the exit from this regime. At the start of this year, annual headline inflation dropped sharply in line with the forecast, reaching very low  albeit positive  levels and then remaining almost unchanged until April. Thereafter, inflation increased in May in line with expectations. The slight downward deviation from the forecast so far in Q2 is due chiefly to lower-than-expected food price inflation. It still holds true that the weakened exchange rate is passing through into inflation in line with expectations. Adjusted for this effect, inflation would be deep in negative territory. Core inflation, also called adjusted inflation excluding fuels, has been in positive territory in line with the forecast since April 2014 following many years of decline. In May it was slightly higher than expected. In the months ahead, however, headline inflation will probably still be lower than expected by the forecast. This will be due to significantly more subdued inflation abroad coupled with mostly non-fundamental factors leading to lower-than-forecasted food prices. Near-zero annual inflation can be expected in the next few months, with slightly negative figures even being possible. At the same time, the outlook for administrative inflation factors in 2015 has been reduced, mainly because of the government's decision to abolish most of the remaining fees in health care and possibly to make other changes in this area. Even so, we expect inflation in 2015 to be close to the 2% target after the aforementioned short-term effects fade out. In line with the message of the forecast, annual growth in economic activity picked up pace significantly, reaching 2.5%. All components of GDP except changes in inventories grew slightly faster than forecasted. The new data thus confirm that the anti-inflationary effect of the domestic economy is weakening. New information on developments abroad obtained from market outlooks and the June Consensus Forecasts survey shifts the outlook for consumer prices and especially producer prices in the euro area slightly downwards. The outlook for economic growth abroad is unchanged. The market outlook for foreign rates has shifted slightly downwards in response to the decrease in key European Central Bank interest rates and additional measures taken by the ECB. Expected oil prices have been revised moderately upwards in both 2014 and 2015. As regards euro and koruna prices of oil, however, the increase in the dollar price of oil is roughly offset by a shift in the path of the outlook for the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar towards a stronger euro compared to the assumptions of the forecast. Domestic wage growth accelerated significantly in Q1 in both the business and non-business sectors. In the business sector, the pick-up in annual wage growth in line with the forecast was partly due to the wage optimisation effect observed in late 2012 and early 2013. At the same time, the unexpected drop in wages at the close of 2013 was offset to a greater extent than forecasted. Thus, wage growth in the business sector was stronger overall compared to the forecast. Clear signs of a positive turnaround are visible in the labour market, broadly in line with expectations and in the context of a growing economy. In addition to wage growth, this is evidenced by continuing growth in employment, a decline in both the seasonally adjusted share of unemployed persons and the general unemployment rate, and an earlier-than-forecasted halt in the decrease in the average length of employment. Newly available monthly indicators from the real economy are signalling a continued economic recovery in Q2. Industrial production and construction output are rising noticeably, as are retail sales. This indicates that the increase in consumption and investment seen in the last two quarters will be of a longer-lasting nature. In the rest of 2014, the evolution of the domestic economy and the labour market will thus probably lead to fulfilment of the current forecast, which may even be slightly exceeded by some indicators. Producer prices are recovering gradually, influenced by the weakening of the koruna. Prices in manufacturing returned to slightly positive levels back in December 2013 and their growth is accelerating slowly. However, the year-on-year change in prices in industry as a whole is still slightly negative owing to a sizeable decrease in energy prices. Prices of construction work returned to modest growth in April and prices of market services did the same in May. The year-on-year decline in agricultural producer prices is moderating gradually, so its continued dampening effect on food price inflation is weakening gradually. To sum up, annual GDP growth was only slightly below the forecast in Q1. By contrast, quarterly economic growth slightly exceeded our expectations. Inflation went up in May, but less markedly than forecasted. On the other hand, average wage growth in Q1 was stronger than expected. As expected in the forecast, the seasonally adjusted share of unemployed persons fell slightly below 8% in Q2."
Romania,2014-07-01,"In its meeting of July 1, 2014, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR is restating that the adequate use of its available tools amid a close monitoring of domestic and global economic developments is aimed at ensuring price stability over the medium term and financial stability. The analysis of the latest macroeconomic data shows the annual inflation rate recording low levels, following in the short run a lower path than previously projected, under the impact of one-off factors (developments in volatile prices, particularly volatile food prices, the nominal appreciation of the local currency) and amid the persistent negative output gap and improved inflation expectations. The consolidation of this path in the medium term is still uncertain. The annual inflation rate fell to a historic low of 0.94 percent in May 2014 from 1.21 percent in the previous month. At the same time, the average annual inflation rate came in at 2.1 percent in May 2014 compared to 2.5 percent in April, while the average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices  which is relevant for ensuring comparability at European level and assessing convergence with the European Union  continued to decrease, reaching 1.8 percent in May versus 2.1 percent in April. Loans to the private sector further recorded a negative annual growth rate on the back of divergent developments in its components. Thus, it is worth noting the faster positive dynamics of leu-denominated loans, fostered also by the lower interest rates on new loans, reflecting the successive monetary policy rate cuts. At the same time, mention should be made of the persistent contraction in foreign currency-denominated loans whose share in total loans narrowed to 58.6 percent from 62.4 percent in June 2013. The gradual recovery of saving continued, the consolidation of this trend in the medium run being important in view of the faster cross-border deleveraging and the need to ensure stable financing sources for the resumption of lending. The improved perception of investors and rating agencies on the Romanian economy, due to the favourable developments witnessed by its fundamentals, has led to an increase in capital inflows, as also reflected in the domestic currency appreciation. International reserves have posted adequate levels, while most of the IMF loans taken in 2009-2010 have been repaid. At the same time, on the money market, the net liquidity surplus has been on the rise and interbank rates have run at levels below the monetary policy rate. These developments and the inflation outlook enable the central bank to adjust the monetary policy stance, also via the programme of gradual, medium-term alignment of minimum reserve requirement ratios to European standards, while effectively anchoring medium-term inflation expectations and closely monitoring domestic and external developments. In today's meeting, based on currently available data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 3.5 percent per annum and to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system. The NBR Board has also decided to lower the minimum reserve requirement ratio on foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 16 percent from 18 percent starting with the July 24-August 23, 2014 maintenance period, while keeping the ratio on leu-denominated liabilities unchanged at 12 percent. The prudent monetary policy stance and the proper dosage of its toolkit, in line with domestic and external developments, may sustainably ensure medium-term price stability in accordance with the multiannual inflation target, along with paving the way for balanced and lasting economic growth and for consolidating convergence with the European Union. In this context, the implementation of the structural reform and policy mix agreed under the external financing arrangements with the international institutions, together with balanced social and political developments during the 2014 election year, is likely to consolidate the stability of the Romanian economy, thereby enhancing its resilience to external shocks. The NBR is restating that the adequate use of all its available tools, amid a close monitoring of domestic and global economic developments, will ensure the achievement of the overriding objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term and financial stability. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for August 4, 2014, when the new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Poland,2014-07-02,"Warsaw, 2 July 2014 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 1-2 July 2014 The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 2.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 4.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis;  bill rediscount rate at 2.75% on an annual basis. Growth in global economic activity remains moderate, although the economic situation varies across countries. In the United States, following a contraction in GDP in early 2014, indicators of economic activity have improved over recent months. In the euro area, weak recovery continues. Activity growth in major emerging economies remains slow as for these countries. Moderate growth in global economic activity is conducive to maintaining low inflation in many economies, including the euro area and Central and Eastern European countries. Monetary policy of the major central banks remains expansionary. In June, the European Central Bank decreased interest rates and announced additional liquidity providing operations to banks in order to stimulate lending. In Poland, a gradual economic recovery continues. Nonetheless. May data show that annual growth in industrial output, construction and assembly output as well as in retail sales was slower than in the preceding months. At the same time, a recent decline in some business climate indices points to a possible slowdown in economic recovery. The economic recovery is accompanied by a moderate acceleration in lending growth, both to companies and households. Labour market conditions are improving gradually. Corporate sector data for May indicate a stabilization of employment and a slight acceleration in wage growth. This was accompanied by a decline in unemployment rate, which however remains at an elevated level. In May. CPI inflation was lower than expected and stood at 0.2%, remaining markedly below the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. At the same time, all core inflation measures remained very low. This was accompanied by a further fall in producer prices and a decline in inflation expectations of both companies and households. The Council got acquainted with the inflation and GDP projection prepared by the Economic Institute, which is one of the inputs to the Council's decisions on the NBP interest rates. In line with the July projection based on the NECMOD model  prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 13 June 2014 (projection cut-off date)  there is a 50-percent probability of inflation running in the range of -0.1-0.4% in 2014 (as compared to 0.8-1.4% in the March projection), 0.5-2.1% in 2015 (as against 1.0-2.6%) and 1.3-3.1% in 2016 (as against 1.6- 3.3%). At the same time, the annual GDP growth  in line with the July projection  will be, with a 50-percent probability, in the range of 3.2-4.1% in 2014 (as compared to 2.9-4.2% in the March projection), 2.6-4.5% in 2015 (as against 2.7-4.8%) and 2.3-4.5% in 2016 (as against 2.3-4.8%). In the opinion of the Council, in the coming months inflation will remain very low and may temporarily fall below zero. In the following quarters, the ongoing economic recovery and improvement in the labour market should support a gradual increase in inflation and its approaching the target in the projection horizon. This assessment is supported by the July projection of inflation and GDP. Nonetheless, uncertainty persists over the scale of further acceleration of economic growth and the prospects of inflation returning to the target. The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council decisions in the coming months will depend on the incoming information, which impacts the assessment of the outlook for economic growth and inflation in the medium term."
Euroarea,2014-07-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The latest information signals that the euro area economy continued its moderate recovery in the second quarter, with low rates of inflation and subdued monetary and credit growth. At the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. The combination of monetary policy measures decided last month has already led to a further easing of the monetary policy stance. The monetary operations to take place over the coming months will add to this accommodation and will support bank lending. As our measures work their way through to the economy, they will contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to 2%. Concerning our forward guidance, the key ECB interest rates will remain at present levels for an extended period of time in view of the current outlook for inflation. Moreover, the Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to also using unconventional instruments within its mandate, should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation. We are strongly determined to safeguard the firm anchoring of inflation expectations over the medium to long term. As a follow-up to the decisions taken in early June, the Governing Council today also decided on specific modalities for the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). The aim of the TLTROs is to enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism by supporting lending to the real economy. A press release on the modalities for the TLTROs will be published today at 3.30 p.m. As announced last month, we have also started to intensify preparatory work related to outright purchases in the ABS market to enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP in the euro area rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of this year. Economic indicators, including survey results available up to June, signal a continuation of the very gradual recovery in the second quarter of 2014. Looking ahead, domestic demand should be supported by a number of factors, including the further accommodation in the monetary policy stance and the ongoing improvements in financing conditions. In addition, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, as well as gains in real disposable income, should make a positive contribution to economic growth. Furthermore, demand for exports should benefit from the ongoing global recovery. However, although labour markets have shown some further signs of improvement, unemployment remains high in the euro area and, overall, unutilised capacity continues to be sizeable. Moreover, the annual rate of change of MFI loans to the private sector remained negative in May and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors are likely to continue to dampen the pace of the economic recovery. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside. In particular, geopolitical risks, as well as developments in emerging market economies and global financial markets, may have the potential to affect economic conditions negatively, including through effects on energy prices and global demand for euro area products. A further downside risk relates to insufficient structural reforms in euro area countries, as well as weaker than expected domestic demand. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.5% in June 2014, unchanged from May. Among the main components, services price inflation increased from 1.1% in May to 1.3% in June, while food price inflation fell from 0.1% to -0.2%. On the basis of current information, annual HICP inflation is expected to remain at low levels over the coming months, before increasing gradually during 2015 and 2016. Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. The Governing Council sees both upside and downside risks to the outlook for price developments as limited and broadly balanced over the medium term. In this context, we will closely monitor the possible repercussions of geopolitical risks and exchange rate developments. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for May 2014 continue to point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (M3). Annual growth in M3 was 1.0% in May, compared with 0.7% in April. The growth of the narrow monetary aggregate M1 moderated to 5.0 % in May, after 5.2% in April. The increase in the MFI net external asset position, reflecting in part the continued interest of international investors in euro area assets, has recently been an important factor supporting annual M3 growth. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.5% in May 2014, compared with -2.8% in April. Lending to non-financial corporations continues to be weak, reflecting the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.5% in May 2014, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. Against the background of weak credit growth, the ongoing comprehensive assessment of banks' balance sheets is of key importance. Banks should take full advantage of this exercise to improve their capital and solvency position, thereby supporting the scope for credit expansion during the next stages of the recovery. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that the current low level of inflation should be followed by a gradual upward movement in HICP inflation rates towards levels closer to 2%. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. As regards fiscal policies, substantial fiscal consolidation in recent years has contributed to reducing budgetary imbalances. Important structural reforms have increased competitiveness and the adjustment capacity of countries' labour and product markets. To strengthen the foundations for sustainable growth and sound public finances, euro area countries should not unravel the progress made with fiscal consolidation, in line with the Stability and Growth Pact, and should proceed with structural reforms in the coming years. Fiscal consolidation should be designed in a growth-friendly manner, and structural reforms should focus on fostering private investment and job creation. A full and consistent implementation of the euro area's existing fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance framework is key to bringing down high public debt ratios, to raising potential growth and to increasing the euro area's resilience to shocks. Finally. I wish to inform you that the Governing Council today announces that the frequency of our monetary policy meetings will change to a six-week cycle, from January 2015. The reserve maintenance periods will be extended to six weeks to match the new schedule. Moreover, we announce our commitment to publish regular accounts of the monetary policy meetings, which is intended to start with the January 2015 meeting. A press release providing more details will be published today at 3.30 p.m."
South Korea,2014-07-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to have continued to ease, while trends of economic growth in emerging market countries have differed from country to country. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance and by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries. In Korea, despite exports having maintained their buoyancy the Committee appraises economic growth to have slowed somewhat, as domestic demand has slackened due largely to the impacts of the Sewol ferry accident. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has shown an uptrend similar to its level of recent years, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will gradually narrow going forward, although its pace of narrowing will be moderate. Consumer price inflation registered 1.7% in June, as in May, even despite a narrowing of the extent of decline in agricultural product prices as the decline in petroleum product prices accelerated. Core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products fell slightly, from 2.2% to 2.1%. The Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, although inflationary pressures appear to be somewhat weaker than previously expected. Housing prices in the country excluding Seoul and its surrounding areas showed a slight upward movement, while leasehold-deposit prices both in Seoul and its surrounding areas and in the rest of the country continued their modest uptrends. In the domestic financial markets, influenced by improvements in economic indicators in and the accommodative monetary policy stances of major countries, as well as by inflows of foreigners' securities investment funds, stock prices have risen, long-term market interest rates have fallen, and the Korean won has appreciated. Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while supporting the recovery of economic growth. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as shifts in major countries' monetary policies, as well as the possibility of a delay in the domestic demand recovery influenced for example by the Sewol ferry accident."
Malaysia,2014-07-10,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to raise the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent. The floor and ceiling rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly raised to 3.00 percent and 3.50 percent respectively. After moderating in the first quarter, the global economy has resumed its path of gradual recovery. Economic activity in the major advanced economies continues to expand at a modest pace. In Asia, the better external environment is supporting growth amid continued expansion in domestic demand. In this environment, international financial markets have remained relatively stable. For Malaysia, latest indicators point to continued strength in exports and private sector activity. Going forward, the overall growth momentum is expected to be sustained. Exports will continue to benefit from the recovery in the advanced economies and from regional demand. Investment activity is projected to remain robust, led by the private sector. Private consumption will be supported by stable income growth and favourable labour market conditions. The prospects are therefore for the Malaysian economy to remain firmly on a steady growth path. Inflation has been relatively stable as the effects of the price adjustments for utilities and energy continue to moderate. Demand driven inflation remains contained. Looking ahead, inflation is, however, expected to remain above its long-run average due to the higher domestic cost factors. Amid the firm growth prospects and with inflation remaining above its long-run average, the MPC decided to adjust the degree of monetary accommodation. This normalisation of monetary conditions also aims to mitigate the risk of broader economic and financial imbalances that could undermine the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy. At the new level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains supportive of the economy. Further review of the degree of monetary accommodation will depend on the MPC's assessment of the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. At the same time, the MPC will also continue to monitor for risks of destabilising financial imbalances. Bank Negara Malaysia 10 July 2014."
Thailand,2014-07-14,"Outcome of the Joint Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 14 July 2014 The Bank of Thailand announced the outcome of the first joint meeting of MPC and FIPC for 2014 as follows. The Committees viewed that the recent economic slowdown has had some impact on the Thai financial and economic stability. Corporate and household income decreased, while the quality of consumer loan deteriorated slightly. However the impact has neither been widespread nor developed into systemic risk. As the recent change in the political situations has improved private sector's confidence, the Thai economy is expected to recover in the periods ahead from public and private spending. Nevertheless tourism has been affected as Asian tourists, who have recently increased their share in the Thai tourism industry, are more sensitive to political situations. The Thai banking system remained sound, with good performance and high level of capital and loan loss provision, enabling it to withstand the economic risk. Despite a slight slowdown in credit growth in tandem with the current economic condition, credits continued to expand to support the real economy. Looking forward, even though the more unambiguous political situations have contributed positively to the Thai economic and financial stability, the clarity and pace of policy implementation need to be monitored. Furthermore the committees viewed that one of the important long-term risk to economic and financial stability stems from fiscal imbalance between revenues and expenditures, as well as the non-budgetary fiscal activities, which have continued to increase. Therefore a structural reform is critical to maintaining fiscal sustainability."
Chile,2014-07-15,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 15 July 2014 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 3.75% (annual). Internationally, incoming information confirms the outlook of recovery of the developed economies, particularly the United States, while growth forecasts for emerging markets have deteriorated. External financial conditions have remained favorable. With respect to commodity prices, an increase in the copper price stands out, while agricultural prices have declined. Higher inflation in Latin America contrasts with the low inflation rates that still prevail in developed economies. Local economic indicators show that the pace of expansion of output and demand has slowed further. The drop in investment was compounded by a slowdown in private consumption. Despite signs of less dynamism in the labor market, the unemployment rate remains low. In June, headline inflation reached 4.3% annually and core inflation measures declined. Y-o-y growth in nominal wages accelerated. Medium-term inflation expectations remained around 3% annually. The most likely scenario continues to consider that inflation will stay above the upper bound of the tolerance range still for some months, and then return to the target. This evolution will continue to be monitored with special attention. The Board will consider the possibility of making additional cuts to the monetary policy rate in line with the evolution of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions and its implications on the inflationary outlook. At the same time, the Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2014-07-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2014 BCRP LOWERED THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE TO 3.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to lower the monetary policy reference rate to 3.75 percent. This level of the reference rate is compatible with an inflation forecast according to which inflation will converge to the target range in 2014 and to 2.0 percent in 2015. The decision of lowering the monetary policy rate takes into account that: inflation expectations remain anchored within the inflation target range; GDP continues to show lower growth rates than the country's potential level of growth, which is expected to be a temporary situation; recent indicators show mixed signals of recovery in the world economy, and the supply factors that led inflation to increase are becoming more moderate. Based on the current information available, this decision does not imply that the BCRP has initiated a sequence of cuts in the policy interest rate. Inflation in June showed a rate of 0.16 percent, as a result of which inflation in the last 12 months fell from 3.56 percent in May to 3.45 percent in June, which reflected a moderation in the supply factors that rose inflation in the previous months. The rate of inflation without food and energy was 0.11 percent, as a result of which the rate of inflation in the last 12 months fell from 2.82 percent in May to 2.77 percent in June. Inflation is forecast to remain initially close to the upper band of the target range due to the persistent effect of the supply shocks and to converge thereafter to the 2 percent target. Current and advanced indicators of activity continue to show a weaker economic cycle than the one expected, with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output due mainly to the lower dynamism observed in investment and exports. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, and will implement additional monetary easing measures if it is necessary. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 2.55 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.55 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.55 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for August on its meeting of August 7, 2014."
Ukraine,2014-07-16,"Having analyzed the behavior of macroeconomic and monetary indicators in the January to June period, the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine pointed to an acceleration in inflation price growth in Ukraine  in June, annual CPI inflation picked up to 12.0%, compared to 0.5% in January. The rally in consumer prices driven by the hryvnia devaluation, the launch of economic reforms pushing up administered prices and tariffs, and ongoing tensions in the east of Ukraine was anticipated. An upward movement in price levels was taken into account when the stabilization program supported by a new Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF was being devised. Certain measures under this program might put some upward pressure on consumer prices in the short run. However, an ultimate goal of the economic reform program is to set Ukraine's economy on a path to sustainable growth, restore stability in the financial system, thus delivering price stability in the mid term. Despite the acceleration in inflation price growth, the money market saw some positive signs indicating a gradual improvement of market expectations that under present conditions are the key factors behind the stability of Ukraine's national currency. These developments were corroborated, among other things, by dominance of net supply of foreign currency seen in the foreign exchange market in the past three months. Overall, in the second quarter of 2014, net supply of foreign currency amounted to USD 0.5 billion, compared to the net demand for foreign currency of USD 1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2014. The move has helped redress imbalances in the interbank foreign exchange market. A 3.3% increase (or UAH 7.1 billion) in the stock of national currency household deposits seen in June points to an improvement in market expectations. The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine is resolute in its determination to ensure fulfillment of its top priority function prescribed by law of achieving and maintaining price stability in the mid term. In view of the above, the macroeconomic forecast and current inflation risks, it is necessary to take additional measures to enhance the intrinsic value of the hryvnia by employing interest rate changes. The above said, coupled with other NBU stabilization measures supported by financial resources provided by the international community will help improve the banks' funding base. Ukraine's money market conditions and market players' expectations. In its turn, it will help put the economy firmly on the path to growth and restore stability in the financial system. In view of the above, pursuant to Articles 6 and 25 of the Law of Ukraine “On the National Bank of Ukraine”. Regulation on the NBU Interest Rate Policy approved by NBU Board Resolution No. 389 dated August 18, 2004 (amended), on July 15, 2014, the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine passed Resolution No. 417 ""On the Money Market Adjustment"", which, inter alia, envisages that the discount rate should be set at 12.5%, effective from July 17, 2014. The discount rate was last changed on April 15, 2014, when it was set at 9.5% per annum. The discount rate is the base rate for the National Bank of Ukraine's other rates. The discount rate serves as a benchmark for measuring the price of money. By changing the discount rate the National Bank of Ukraine sends a signal to market participants about the stance of the monetary policy and signals that it is resolute in its efforts to exercise its main function in ensuring the hryvnia stability."
Egypt,2014-07-17,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release July 17, 2014 In its meeting held on July 17, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation by 100 basis points to 925 percent, 1025 percent, and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also raised by 100 basis points to 975 percen. Headline CPI increased by 084 percent (m/m) in June compared to a decline of 073 percent (m/m) in May while the annual rate remained broadly unchanged at 820 percent in Jun. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 068 percent (m/m) in June compared to a decline of 023 percent in May, while the annual rate decreased to 876 percent in June down from 886 percent in May on the back of favorable base effect from last yea. The quarter ending June 2014 has witnessed a notable slowdown in the prices of several food items which have been reflected in the tame monthly growth rates of both headline and core inflatio. Moreover as the possibility of a sharp rebound in international food prices is unlikely in light of recent global developments, upside risks to the inflation outlook from imported inflation continue to be containe. Meanwhile real GDP picked up slightly in 2013/2014 Q3, growing by 250 percent compared to the 104 and 144 percent recorded in the previous two quarters, respectivel. This brought the annual growth for the first nine months of 2013/2014 to 165 percent compared to the growth rate of 231 percent during the corresponding period of 2012/201. The slight pickup in economic activity during 2013/2014 Q3 came on the back of the pickup in the growth rates in the two key sectors, namely manufacturing and construction, despite the contraction witnessed in the tourism and petroleum sector. In the meantime, investment levels continue to be low despite the relative improvement witnessed in the annual growth rate, which registered 250 percent after six quarters of contractio. Looking ahead, downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. The government has revised up the prices of several regulated items within the CPI basket including fuel, electricity, and tobacco as part of the 2014/2015 fiscal consolidation pla. While the fiscal consolidation will improve the fiscal sustainability over the medium-term, a relative price increase is inevitabl. The direct first round effect of these price adjustments will lead to a level shift up in the headline CPI for July 2014, while the indirect and second round effects could be reflected in both the headline and core inflation rates during the quarter ending September 2014 at varying degrees, which pose an upside risk to the inflation outloo. Therefore while the MPC acknowledges the favorable medium- term effect of the fiscal measures, it is mindful to the importance of anchoring inflation expectation. Against this background and given the balance of risks, the MPC judges that a preemptive rate hike is warranted to anchor inflation expectations and hence limit a generalized price increase, which is detrimental to the economy over the medium-ter. However the MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter.

Turkiye,2014-07-17,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 12 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been kept at 11.5 percent, and borrowing rate has been reduced from 8 percent to 7.50 percent. b) One-week repo rate has been reduced from 8.75 percent to 8.25 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been kept at 13.5 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. In line with these developments, recent data point to a modest course in private final domestic demand. Meanwhile, with the help of the recovery in foreign demand, exports contribute positively to economic growth. The Committee expects that such a demand composition will support disinflation and will lead to a significant improvement in the current account balance in 2014. The adverse impact of exchange rate developments since mid-2013 on annual inflation is gradually tapering off. Recently, elevated food prices have been the main factor limiting the pace of decline in inflation. In light of these assessments and the recent improvement in global liquidity conditions, the Committee decided to deliver a measured cut in the one-week repo rate. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2014-07-17,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 17 July 2014 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the economic growth outlook has deteriorated against the backdrop of protracted strike action in the mining and manufacturing sectors. The economy contracted in the first quarter of 2014, and the growth outlook for the rest of the year remains subdued amid low business confidence. Compounding the MPC's policy dilemma, inflation has breached the upper end of the target range, driven primarily by the exchange rate depreciation and rising food prices, while a possible wage-price spiral resulting from recent wage settlements and wage demands considerably in excess of inflation and productivity growth have added to the upside risk to the inflation outlook. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 6,6 per cent in May, up from 6,0 per cent and 6,1. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 6,6 per cent in May, up from 6,0 per cent and 6,1 2 per cent in March and April 2014 respectively. The main driver of this marked acceleration was food and non-alcoholic beverage price inflation which measured 8,8 per cent in May compared with 7,0 per cent and 7,8 per cent in the previous two months. This category contributed 1,3 percentage points to the headline CPI outcome, compared with a recent low of 0,5 percentage points in December 2013. The categories of food, housing utilities and transport together accounted for 4,2 percentage points of the inflation outcome in May, compared with 3,7 percentage points in the previous month. The transport index increased at an annual rate of 8,9 per cent, from 6,8 per cent in April, despite a 15c per litre decline in the petrol price in May. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, remained unchanged at 5,5 per cent for the third consecutive month. Administered price inflation excluding petrol was unchanged from the previous month at 6,5 per cent. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods moderated slightly from 8,8 per cent in April to 8,7 per cent in May, driven in part by lower agricultural product inflation. The marginal improvement in the Bank's forecast of headline inflation at the previous meeting has been more or less reversed, as recent food price developments surprised on the upside. Inflation is now expected to average 6,3 per cent in 2014, compared with 6,2 per cent previously, with the quarterly peak of 6,6 per cent (previously 6,5 per cent) still expected in the fourth quarter, following a slight moderation in the third quarter. The forecast average inflation for 2015 increased to 5,9 per cent from 5,8 per cent, while the forecast for 2016. The forecast average inflation for 2015 increased to 5,9 per cent from 5,8 per cent, while the forecast for 2016 3 increased marginally to 5,6 per cent, and to 5,5 per cent in the final quarter of that year. Inflation is still expected to return to within the target band during the second quarter of 2015, provided that there are no further shocks to the system, particularly from possible higher tariff increases being granted to Eskom by Nersa from 2015. The forecast for core inflation is unchanged. This measure is expected to average 5,6 per cent and 5,7 per cent in 2014 and 2015 respectively, moderating to 5,5 per cent in 2016, with the moderate upward pressure coming from the lagged effects of the exchange rate depreciation rather than evidence of strong domestic demand pressures. As before, the MPC sees the risks to the headline inflation forecast to be skewed to the upside. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University have remained anchored at the upper end of the target band. The average inflation expectation of analysts, business people and trade union officials for this year and next year has remained unchanged for six consecutive quarters at 6,1 per cent for both years, declining to 5,9 per cent in 2016. Within these categories, the largest change was by business people for 2016, where expectations increased from 6,2 per cent in the previous survey to 6,4 per cent. However, their expectation for 2015 moderated slightly. Inflation expectations of households for 2014 declined from 6,7 per cent in the first quarter to 6,3 per cent in the second quarter. 4 The Reuters survey of inflation expectations of economic analysts conducted in May is more or less unchanged since the previous survey, with a slight upward shift. The outcome of the survey shows a divergence of views among analysts as to whether inflation will peak in the second or fourth quarter of 2014. On average, the expectation is for inflation to peak in the second quarter, at an average of 6,4 per cent, and to return to within the target range in the first quarter of 2015. According to the survey, annual inflation is expected to average 6,2 per cent in 2014, and 5,7 per cent and 5,5 per cent in the subsequent two years respectively. The global economy continues to exhibit mixed signals regarding the economic growth outlook. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, consensus forecasts for growth in 2014 have been revised down for the US and the Eurozone, but those for Japan and the UK have been revised upwards. The earlier optimism that the US would grow at around 3 per cent in 2014 has been moderated following the 2,9 per cent annualised contraction in the first quarter, partly a result of severe weather conditions and a decline in expenditure on health care. Most analysts now expect US growth to be closer to 2 per cent. This weaker growth is despite larger-than-expected improvements in the unemployment rate. The outlook for the Eurozone has also deteriorated, following weak industrial output in Germany in May, and slowing growth in France and Italy. Real output in Japan is expected to contract in the second quarter following the surge in expenditure in the first quarter in advance of the increase of consumption taxes. The UK recovery, 5 however, appears to be sustained with growth of around 3 per cent expected in 2014. The outlook for emerging markets remains relatively subdued, but some emerging Asian economies have benefited from stronger US growth. The Chinese economy is expected to grow just under 7,5 per cent in 2014, although concerns about the shadow banking system remain. Subdued growth is expected in a number of emerging markets including Brazil. Russia. Thailand and Argentina. Global financial market developments remain dominated by expectations of changes in monetary policy in the advanced economies, amid concerns that the current low interest rate and low volatility environment may encourage excessive risk taking and asset price bubbles. By contrast to a number of emerging market economies, inflation remains benign in the advanced economies, although the risk of deflation in the Eurozone persists. The UK is expected to be the first advanced economy to raise interest rates, but at a moderate pace, while the US is generally not expected to begin the process of normalisation before the third quarter of 2015. However, the tapering of bond purchases by the Fed is expected to continue at a steady pace. This process is fully discounted in the markets, and is expected to be completed later this year. 6 By contrast, the ECB has recently announced a range of new monetary policy measures aimed at stimulating the economy through encouraging bank lending and preventing deflation, while Japanese monetary policy is expected to remain highly stimulatory for some time. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, a number of countries have reduced their policy rates, including the Eurozone. Sweden. Mexico. Hungary and Turkey, while the tightening cycle continued in New Zealand. The exchange rate of the rand continues to pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook. Having appreciated to a level of R10,29 against the US dollar soon after the previous MPC meeting, the rand exchange rate followed a depreciating trend, reaching a new trading range of between R10,60 and R10,80 since the beginning of June. Since the previous meeting the rand has depreciated by 2,6 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The appreciation of the rand in May was in response to more benign global factors as market participants absorbed the forward guidance provided by the central banks in the advanced economies. This contributed to lower risk aversion and renewed flows to emerging markets in general. Since the previous meeting, non-resident net purchases of bonds and equities amounted to R7,2 billion, and R44,2 billion since the beginning of February. Despite these inflows, since early June the rand has largely decoupled from its emerging market peers, and depreciated relative to most currencies, as it reacted to deteriorating domestic fundamentals. These included the negative GDP growth. These included the negative GDP growth 7 rate, the adverse reports from the ratings agencies, and the protracted nature of the platinum and metal workers strikes. The impact of the platinum sector strikes on exports began to be felt in April and May, and it is estimated that during these two months the value of platinum group metals (PGM) exports was around R20 billion lower than during the first quarter. This is likely to put pressure on the current account of the balance of payments in the second quarter, following a narrowing of the deficit in the first quarter to 4,5 per cent of GDP. South Africa's growth outlook has deteriorated since the previous meeting of the MPC, compounded by continued labour disruptions. Following a contraction of 0,6 per cent in the first quarter, the outlook for the second quarter is expected to be positive, but subdued, particularly in the light of weak mining and manufacturing data in May. The Bank's latest forecast, which assumes a speedy resolution of the metal workers' strike, sees growth in 2014 at 1,7 per cent, compared with 2,1 per cent previously and 2,8 per cent at the beginning of the year. Growth forecasts for the coming two calendar years have been reduced to 2,9 per cent and 3,2 per cent, from 3,1 per cent and 3,4 per cent respectively. The RMB/BER Business Confidence Index remained low and unchanged at 41 index points in the second quarter of 2014, with a sharp decline particularly evident among manufacturers. The Bank's leading indicator of economic activity declined moderately, reflecting subdued growth expectations. 8 The weak business confidence is mirrored in the 2,6 per cent growth in gross fixed capital formation in the first quarter of 2014. Growth in fixed investment by the private sector, which accounts for about two thirds of gross fixed capital formation, weakened further, from 2,4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2013 to 1,0 per cent in the first quarter of 2014. The mining sector contracted by an annualised 24,7 per cent in the first quarter of 2014, and although mainly driven by the strike-induced decline in PGM output, the contraction was fairly broad-based across the sector. Despite a higher-than- expected performance in April, the data for May show that the outlook for the second quarter is also bleak. In May, the physical volume of mining output declined by (a non-annualised) 3,1 per cent on a month-to-month basis, and by 5,6 per cent on a three-month-to-three month basis, with PGM output declining by 34,1 per cent. While the strike is over and miners are returning to work. PGM production is not expected to normalise for some time, and possible shaft closures could reduce the longer term potential of the sector. The manufacturing sector performance in the first two months of the second quarter has also been disappointing, following the 4,4 per cent contraction in the first quarter. In May, manufacturing output declined by 3,7 per cent on a year-on- year basis, and by 2,0 per cent on a three-month-on-three-month basis. The sector was negatively impacted by electricity supply constraints and the platinum sector strike, while the current strike by metal workers is likely to undermine the. The sector was negatively impacted by electricity supply constraints and the platinum sector strike, while the current strike by metal workers is likely to undermine the 9 outlook for the third quarter. The Kagiso PMI registered a slight improvement in June, measuring 46,6 index points, but has remained below the neutral 50 index point level for three consecutive months. Trends in employment growth are indicative of the weak private sector investment. Although formal non-agricultural employment increased for the third consecutive quarter in the first quarter of 2014, all the gains were in the public sector. While overall employment increased by 42,000 jobs in the year to the end of March, 49,000 jobs were created in the public sector while the private sector shed jobs, particularly in the mining sector where almost 29,000 jobs were lost. Final consumption expenditure by households remains the main driver of GDP growth, but with a declining contribution of 1,2 percentage points in the first quarter of 2014. Growth in household consumption expenditure, which measured 2,6 per cent in 2013, declined to 1,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2014, with a marked moderation in the growth of expenditure on durable goods and a contraction in spending on non-durable goods. Real retail sales growth contracted by 0,8 per cent on a three-month-to-three-month basis in May, and increased at a month-to-month rate of 0,8 per cent. Domestic motor vehicle sales declined by 2,3 per cent on a year-on-year basis, but increased by 4,7 per cent on a month-to-month basis in June. Despite these weak trends, consumer confidence surprised on the upside in the second quarter, with the FNB/BER. Despite these weak trends, consumer confidence surprised on the upside in the second quarter, with the FNB/BER 10 consumer confidence index increasing from -6 to 4 index points, although respondents do not deem the present time as appropriate to buy durable goods. Growth over twelve months in total loans and advances to the private sector measured 8,2 per cent in May 2014, but the divergent trends in bank credit extended to households and the corporate sector have continued. Growth in credit extended to the corporate sector has been steadily increasing since the beginning of the year, measuring 13,3 per cent in May, due in part to renewable energy contracts. By contrast, growth in credit extended to the private sector has continued to trend downwards, to measure 4,3 per cent in May. Twelve-month growth in general loans to households, mainly unsecured lending, declined to 2,8 per cent in May, its lowest growth since February 2005. Mortgage credit extension remained within the 2 to 3 per cent range observed since January 2013, and instalment sale credit and leasing finance also continued to moderate, from growth rates of around 13 per cent in the second half of 2013 to 8,6 per cent in May. These credit extension trends to households reflect a combination of weakening household consumption expenditure, and stricter bank lending criteria for unsecured loans in particular. Household debt to disposable income remains elevated, but declined marginally to 74,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2014. The trend in wage settlements pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook, and these pressures are likely to intensify in the current difficult labour relations environment. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average 11 wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements increased from 7,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 to 8,1 per cent in the second quarter. However, increases over four quarters in nominal unit labour costs in the formal non- agricultural sector, declined from 5,9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2013 to 4,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2014. The MPC is concerned that recent wage settlements in the mining sector and current demands in the metals sector could set a precedent for wage demands more generally. Unless accompanied by higher productivity, such settlements could generate a wage price spiral, and are also likely to have a negative impact on employment trends. While the focus has generally been on wage demands, there is an imperative for attention to also be paid to excessive salaries and bonuses of management and executives. Food prices have been one of the main drivers of inflation since the beginning of the year and have generally surprised on the upside in recent months. There are, however, some tentative indications that we may be near the peak: in May, manufactured food producer price inflation moderated for the first time since October 2013, and measured 8,9 per cent, down from 9,5 per cent in April. Agricultural producer price inflation declined from a recent peak of 13,3 per cent in March, to 6,7 per cent in May reflecting in part the sharp decline in maize prices to export parity price levels. Prices of cereals and other crops declined by 0,8 per cent in May, having reached a recent peak of 27,6 per cent in February. Global food price pressures are also benign, with the year-on-year inflation rates as reflected in the FAO food price index being negative for 12 consecutive. Global food price pressures are also benign, with the year-on-year inflation rates as reflected in the FAO food price index being negative for 12 consecutive 12 months. Apart from weather-related risks, the overall trend in food prices will remain highly sensitive to exchange rate developments. Despite recent geopolitical risks, particularly in the Ukraine and Iraq, international oil prices have remained relatively stable. Apart from a brief spike to a level of around US$115 per barrel in June, the price of Brent crude oil has generally traded in a range of US$105 and US$110 per barrel, and is currently at around US$105 per barrel. Domestic petrol prices have therefore been driven primarily by exchange rate changes. Following the appreciation of the rand in April, the petrol price was reduced by a total of 37 cents per litre in May and June, but this was largely reversed in July when the price increased by 31 cents per litre. Should current trends persist, a further small increase in the petrol price can be expected in August. The MPC remains concerned about weak growth, widening output gap and the negative employment outlook. The strike in the platinum sector contributed to the downward revision of the growth forecast, and the latest forecast has not factored in the possibility of a protracted work stoppage by the metal workers, which would potentially have much wider ramifications because of the direct linkages to other sectors of the economy. This weak growth outlook, however, is not something that monetary policy can ameliorate. The MPC is also increasingly concerned about the inflation outlook, and the further upside risks to the forecast. Although the exchange rate remains a key. Although the exchange rate remains a key 13 factor in this regard, the possibility of a wage-price spiral should wage settlements well in excess of inflation and productivity growth become an economy-wide norm has increased. Although the inflation trajectory has not deteriorated markedly since the previous meeting, upside risks have increased, and it is expected to remain uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range when it does eventually return to within the target. The upside risk factors make this trajectory highly vulnerable to any significant changes in inflation pressures. Although inflation expectations have remained relatively anchored, should inflation persist outside the target band, these expectations risk becoming dislodged. The MPC is, however, cognisant of the fact that the inflation pressures do not reflect excess demand conditions in the economy. Household consumption expenditure remains weak, and credit extension to households is contracting in real terms. However, we do have to be mindful of second-round effects of supply side shocks. The MPC faces an increasingly difficult dilemma of rising inflation and slowing growth. The core mandate of the Bank remains price stability, but at the same time, in achieving this mandate, we have to be mindful of the impact of our actions on economic growth and tread a fine line between acting effectively to address the inflation objective, while not undermining growth unduly. 14 The MPC has decided to continue on its gradual normalisation path and raise the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 5,75 per cent per annum, effective from Friday 18 July. Given the expected inflation trajectory, the real repurchase rate remains slightly negative and well below its longer term neutral level. The monetary policy stance remains supportive of the domestic economy, and, as before, any future moves will be gradual and highly data dependent. We would like to reiterate that monetary policy should not be seen as the growth engine of the economy. The sources of the below par growth performance are largely outside the realms of monetary policy. In the short term, an improvement in the interaction and relationships between management and labour is essential to foster a climate of trust and confidence, and get South Africa back to work. Given that the key headwinds preventing a return to trend growth are structural, there is an urgent need to implement necessary structural reforms, as envisaged in the National Development Plan, in order to achieve higher and more inclusive growth.

Nigeria,2014-07-21,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 96 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. July 21-22, 2014 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on July 21 and 22, 2014 against the backdrop of continuing QE3 tapering by the US Federal Reserve which has resulted in the slowing of inflows to emerging markets and frontier economies; and the attendant uncertainties in the outlook for monetary policy and financial stability in the post- tapering period. The meeting was attended by 10 members. new member. Prof. Dahiru Hassan Balami, whose appointment had recently been confirmed by the Senate, was also in attendance. The Committee deliberated on key external and domestic economic developments and considered the Banking Stability Report since the MPC meeting of May 2014 as well as the outlook for the rest of the year. The global monetary policy environment appears to be further complicated by risks posed by continued currency crisis and fragility in Europe, geo-political tensions in the Middle East and a number of emerging and developing economies. Domestically the policy challenges remain. These include the uptick in inflation, anticipated increased spending towards the general elections and the possible effects of US tapering on the domestic market. International Economic Developments The Committee noted that the rebound in global economic activity strengthened in the first half of 2014; although at levels lower than previously projected. The tapered growth arose mainly from the emerging and developing economies owing to the rising real interest rates and geo-political crisis. On the whole, the effects of the global financial crisis have continued to wane even as the issues of rising income inequality, unemployment and poverty appear to be gaining prominence; engaging the attention of the monetary authorities. These latest projections indicate that the euro area is gradually coming out of recession, as growth projection for 2014 is 2 positive for all member countries albeit with significant variation. Growth is expected to be stronger in the core EU countries while high debt and financial fragmentation continue to weigh on aggregate domestic demand in the peripheral countries. For the entire euro zone, there is a risk of low inflation or outright deflation which could result in higher real interest rates that may constrain output expansion. In the emerging and developing economies, growth is projected at 50 per cent in 2014 from 47 per cent in 2013, buoyed by stronger external demand from the advanced countries. The key downside risks in the developing and emerging economies include: political uncertainty, exchange rate realignment in response to changing fundamentals, further monetary tightening to address emerging currency crisis, and tighter external financing conditions arising from the rapid normalization of the US monetary policy. Inflation is projected to remain subdued in 2014 and 2015, partly reflecting the significant output gaps in the developed economies, weaker domestic demand in developing and emerging economies, and 3 sliding commodity prices, especially fuels and food. In the advanced economies, inflation is currently below target and its return to the long run trend could take a while due to the slow pace of economic recovery. Likely depreciation in currencies, domestic demand pressure, and capacity constraints could pose upside risks to inflation in the emerging market economies. The Committee noted that the stance of monetary policy could diverge across regions over the medium term on account of variations in risks and other challenges confronting various economies. The US is expected to commence tightening by the second half of 2015 as inflation hits the long run target and unemployment rate falls to the threshold level. The euro area and Japan are expected to continue with supportive monetary policy due to low inflation including threat of deflation in some countries, weak recovery, weakness in bank balance sheets, and strong demand for their bonds as a result of low sovereign risk. Majority of the central banks remained cautious with regard to the stance of monetary policy. While most advanced economies are 4 likely to maintain an accommodative stance for monetary policy for the rest of the year to firm up aggregate demand and employment, the major impetus for monetary policy adjustments in the emerging markets and developing economies could come from the effects of the US Fed's tapering of QE3 on their currencies and the financial markets. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported revised growth numbers from 2010 to 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, as part of the GDP rebasing exercise. Accordingly the estimated growth rate for 2013 now stands at 549 per cent, compared with 531 and 421 per cent recorded in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Similarly the revised estimate of 677 per cent for the fourth quarter of 2013 was an improvement over the 517 and 364 per cent in the previous quarter and the corresponding period of 2012, respectively. In the first quarter of 2014, real GDP growth was 621 per cent, which was higher than the corresponding quarter of 2013. In line with the trend, 5 the non-oil sector was the main driver of growth in the first quarter of 2014, recording 821 per cent growth. The key growth drivers in the non-oil sector in the first quarter of 2014 remained industry, agriculture, trade, and services which contributed 177, 126, 126 and 315 per cent, respectively. The oil sector continued to record improvements in performance with its growth rate improving from - 936 and -1140 per cent, respectively, in the fourth and first quarters of 2013, to -660 per cent in the first quarter of 2014. The Committee welcomed the impressive growth performance but noted that the country has the potential to do better with appropriate supportive macroeconomic policies. The Committee, therefore, stressed the imperatives for monetary policy to sustain efforts aimed at supporting non-inflationary growth in key sectors of the economy. The Committee also emphasized the need for government to sustain and deepen tax revenue and enhance efforts aimed at fast-tracking the structural transformation of the economy with a view to making it resilient to adverse shocks as well 6 as creating the necessary platforms for reducing unemployment, income inequality, and poverty in the country. Prices Developments in the aggregate price level suggest an underlying inflationary pressure since January 2014. The year-on-year headline inflation steadily inched up marginally from 79 per cent in April to 80 per cent in May 2014 and further to 82 per cent in June. The up-tick in June was, however, largely attributed to the rise in food inflation which rose from 97 per cent in May 2014 to 98 per cent in June while core inflation, on the other hand, rose from 77 per cent in May 2014 to 81 per cent in June. The Committee noted that all measures of inflation have witnessed progressive upward trend since February 2014 and agreed that this trend should be monitored closely to achieve a reversal. Monetary Credit and Financial Markets' Developments Broad money (M2) rose by 166 per cent in June 2014 over the level at end-December 2013, indicating an annualized growth rate of 331 7 per cent. The annualized growth rate was considerably lower than the growth benchmark of 1552 per cent for fiscal 2014. For the same period, net domestic credit increased by 088 per cent compared with the growth rate of 1539 per cent over the corresponding period of 2013. When annualized, net domestic credit rose by 177 per cent, compared with the growth benchmark of 285 per cent for fiscal 2014. The expansion in aggregate domestic credit was mainly due to the increase in claims on the private sector which increased by 275 per cent in June 2014, which was however, moderated by the contraction in net credit to Government. Meanwhile money market rates remained within the MPR corridor during the review period. The monthly weighted average OBB rate was 1038 per cent in May 2014 but it increased by 14 basis points to 1052 per cent in June. The uncollaterized overnight rate was 1050 per cent in June 2014, compared with 1063 per cent in May 2014. Overall both the OBB and overnight call rates were trading closer to the lower bound of the MPR corridor on account of liquidity surfeit in the banking system. Activities in the capital market were bullish 8 during the period with the All-Share Index (ASI) increasing by 28 per cent from 41,,32919 at end-December 2013 to 42,,48248 at end-June 2014. Market capitalization also moved in the same direction. External Sector Developments All the segments of the foreign exchange market witnessed a considerable degree of stability during the period. The exchange rate at the retail-Dutch Auction System Segment (rDAS) of the market was flat at N15729/US$ in the review period. At the inter- bank market, the selling rate opened at N16220/US$ and closed at N16295, representing a depreciation of N075 or 046 per cent. Conversely at the BDC segment, the exchange rate opened at N16700/US$ and closed at N16800/US$, representing a depreciation of N100 or 06 per cent. Gross official reserves rose to US$4020 billion by 18 July from US$3731 billion at end-June 2014. The increase in reserves was mainly due to increased accretion and moderation in the rate of depletion. The Committee's Consideration The Committee was satisfied with the relative stability in the macroeconomy as reflected in the impressive growth rates, stable consumer prices and exchange rate as well as increased external reserves. It was however concerned about the weak translation of stability to microeconomic gains in employment and access to finance especially by small and medium scale businesses. It therefore, emphasized the need for the MPC decisions to take into account the long run impact on employment level, wealth creation and growth of businesses. The Committee noted the potential of the power sector to stimulate output growth through enhanced investment and the spill-over effect in employment generation if the challenges confronting the sector are effectively and appropriately addressed. Specifically it noted that gas-to-power has remained a binding constraint in reaping the benefits of the recently-concluded power sector reforms; urging for the collective efforts of government, private investors and the banks to resolve. Other pressure points include the 10 underlying pressure from food/core inflation and the risks that could emanate from the likely increase in aggregate spending in the run up to the 2015 general elections. The Committee was also concerned about the implications of the on-going QE3 tapering for inflows and external reserves. The Committee recognized the necessity of sustaining a stable naira exchange even as it has to deal with the delicate balancing of the need for a low interest rate regime. The Committee noted that portfolio flows were not employment generating but were essential in the absence of adequate fiscal buffers. The Committee welcomed the moderation in the rate of depletion in external reserves in recent months, noting that reserves accretion needed to improve much faster to provide a strong and more resilient buffer to fiscal operations. The Committee, however, noted that a gradual reduction in the country's import bills through domestic production of some of the major food imports should be a key element in the overall reserves accretion strategy. It welcomed 11 the decision of the Bank to collaborate with other stakeholders in this regard. The Committee further expressed concern about the liquidity level and the trending uptick in inflation which may not be unconnected with the poor harvest in some agricultural producing areas, particularly in the north eastern and central states of the country. It however, noted that other reform measures could dampen food prices in the short to medium term and restore inflation to a sustainable long-run path. Overall the Committee noted that the policy direction of inflation, exchange rate and interest rate must be seen not only in the context of price and financial stability but also in enhancing the quality of life of Nigerians and promoting employment generation. The Committee's Decisions In view of these developments, the Committee decided by a unanimous vote to retain the current stance of monetary policy with one member voting for an asymmetric corridor around the MPR. Consequently the MPC voted to: 12 Retain the MPR at 12 per cent with a corridor of +/- 200 basis points around the midpoint; Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent; Retain the public sector Cash Reserve Requirement at 750 per cent; and Retain the private sector Cash Reserve Requirement at 150 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 22nd July 2014 13 PERSONAL STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE 10 ADELABU. ADEBAYO Developments in the macroeconomy in the first half of the year remained broadly positive albeit with cautious optimism about the outlook for the remaining period of the year. The revised GDP following the rebasing exercise, as expected, was lower but the estimate of 549 per cent for 2013 could be adjudged robust particularly when cognizance is taken of the weak global economic recovery. Stability in the exchange rate appears strengthened in virtually all the segments of the markets while external reserves witnessed a modest improvement, relative to the position at the last meeting. There are however a number of risks to macro stability over the short to medium term. First the evolving trend in price level should give concern to the monetary authority. Although headline inflation is still largely subdued at 82 per cent in June 2014, there seems to be considerable degree of underlying pressure given that it has 14 consistently trended upwards in the last three months. More importantly, food inflation is projected to rise beyond single digit in the second half of the year thereby posing significant risk to the long term inflation target of the Bank. Apart from structural issues that could impinge on food inflation, the electioneering activities would reach the climax in the second half of 2014 cum early period of 2015. Besides the development in price level has implications for banking system stability. The weighted average deposit rate as at May was 632 per cent, suggesting that depositors earned negative real interest rate which may fuel loss of deposit from the banks with the attendant impact on the banking system stability. As a result, reduction of the policy rate which could further lead to reduction in deposit rate without a concomitant reduction in lending rate may not be appropriate at the moment. Again the relative modest improvement in the external reserves notwithstanding, there has been persistent demand pressure in the foreign exchange market since January. Cumulative net outflow as 15 at end- May 2014 was about US$75 billion as against cumulative net inflow of US$372 billion in the corresponding period of 2013. The prospects in the medium term horizon appear dim with the tighter external financial conditions being a key issue. Unemployment rate in the US fell to an all-time low of 61 per cent in June 2014, a clear evidence of strong recovery process, which informed the Federal Reserve to shift the termination of its asset purchase program to the fourth quarter of 2014 as against the initially planned 2015. Thus appropriate monetary policy measures need to be in put place at least to provide soft landing for the economy during the adjustment period. This said, monetary policy environment is facing a difficult dilemma at this point in time as improvement in the macroeconomy has not sufficiently translated to impressive socio economic indicators. For example, statistics on unemployment rate revealed that it has virtually been trending upwards since 2009, reaching 2470 per cent in 2013 against the 5-year (2009-13) average of 2336 per cent. In the light of daunting challenges of high unemployment and poverty 16 confronting the economy, an accommodating monetary policy that would foster inclusive growth and poverty reduction is desirable. It is imperative, however, to bring to bear that if stability is not achieved in the short term, the anticipated long term objective of growth, unemployment, and reduction in poverty may remain elusive. It is equally important to recognize the limitations of monetary policy in addressing most of the fundamental problems including building reserve buffers. Some of the issues require active support of the fiscal authority particularly building of external reserves through accretion from oil earnings. Perhaps more importantly, there are a number of deep rooted problems that limit access to finance by real sector operators which could render reduction of policy rates by the central bank ineffective. The problems are mainly due to uncompetitive business environment resulting from poor state of infrastructure, security challenges, and weak institutions. These problems require major structural reforms. To this end. I believe a robust engagement with the fiscal authority is a sine qua non. 17 On the whole, pending the time the necessary building blocks for the resilience of the economy would be put in place, it is worthwhile to maintain stability in the macroeconomy by holding steady the subsisting monetary policy measures. Consequently I vote for retention of MPR at 12%, private sector CRR at 15%, public sector CRR at 75%, and LR at 30%. .0 ALADE. O SARAH Global economic growth forecast have backpedalled due to revision in the first quarter performance of the US. economy. The downward revision in the US. is due to severe winter weather disruptions, subdued consumer spending, construction and industrial activities. In spite of these developments, growth is expected to accelerate as the year progresses and is projected to reach 34 and 40 percent respectively in 2014 and 2015 according to July IMF WEO. In emerging markets, while earlier risks have diminished, there are increased geopolitical risks from the Middle East and euro area. In the domestic environment, the renewed inflationary pressure and expected fiscal spending as the election year approaches poses 18 some concern for monetary policy. Based on the above. I support a hold in policy rate. While there are some downside risks to global growth, the US Economy is showing some impressive momentum. Growth in the United States is showing some momentum with strong consumer confidence index. .S. employers accelerated their hiring last month, adding a robust 288,,000 jobs and helping drive the unemployment rate to 61 percent, the lowest rate since September 2008. This is the fifth straight monthly job gain above 200,,000 jobs in the US, although wages are yet to rise significantly. In the Euro zone, slowing inflation has raised real interest rate which may affect growth in the zone. Countries in the zone are at different stages of economic activities as general confidence is waning. These developments coupled with the effects of the tapering could dampen domestic conditions, thus the need for monetary policy to be proactive and guarded. Headline inflation increased to 82 percent in June compared to 80 percent recorded in May 2014. Headline inflation increased to 82 19 percent in June, suggesting that inflation may be expected to stay elevated in the coming months, due to possible food supply shortage. This is the fourth consecutive month of year-on-year increases in the Headline index since February. Both food and core inflation rose slightly. Food inflation increased from 97 percent in May to 98 percent in June, while core inflation increased from 77 percent in May to 81 percent in June. Staff projection suggests that inflation is expected to exceed the upper bound of the implicit inflation threshold of 9 percent before the end of 2014, although it will still remain in the single digit range. This suggest that even with the anticipated fiscal risk as a result of pre-election and increased security spending, monetary policy cannot ignore the inflationary outlook. Based on this, monetary policy should remain cautious to anticipate the impact of fiscal, security and food supply shocks. While domestic growth has remained strong, some risks to growth are evident. The newly rebased GDP forecast for 2014 GDP remained strong and robust with 2013 fourth quarter growth estimated at 677 percent compared with 517 percent in the 20 preceding quarter. The 2014 first quarter GDP growth rose by 621 percent which is higher than the 445 percent recorded in the corresponding period of 2013, but lower than the 677 percent in last quarter of 2014. The rebased GDP show a more diversified economy that will require a multi-agency coordination for sustaining the growth momentum and achieving inclusive growth. The sustenance of this robust growth rate and the achievement of broad-based growth will require the creation of an environment that is conducive, competitive and attractive to both foreign and domestic investors. Monetary policy must therefore continue to ensure the maintenance of macroeconomic stability. The risk of fiscal expansion in the run up to the general election is very likely. There will be pressure to increase the speed of implement of the budget by both the legislative and the executive as the general election approaches. In addition, the security challenges facing the country will also require additional spending to secure the country and its boarders, while these are legitimate expenses; they are bound to put upward pressure on both inflation and exchange 21 rate. Therefore all efforts should be made to ensure that excess liquidity in the system that is not channeled into productive activities should be sterilized. Thus monetary policy should do all it can to help contain inflationary pressure and lowering rate at this point may be counter-productive. Stability has returned to the Foreign exchange market, though some risks remain. This has been helped by accretion to the foreign reserve and sustained inflow in the local bond market. The risk to this stability will be the impact of the deadline given to the Bureau de change (BDCs) of July 31, 2014 to recapitalize. However the resolve to build buffers would help counter any adverse market reaction to the change. An added risk is the effect of tapering on the economy as advanced economies recovery continues. Therefore global and domestic events should be monitored to avoid downside risk to the Naira exchange rate Money market conditions suggest ample liquidity in the banking system. Rates at the Interbank and Open Buy Back (OBB) rate have 22 remained within the corridor at weighted average rate of 1050 and 1048 percent, respectively, between May, 2014 and July 18, 204. These indicate excess liquidity in the system as banks accessed the Standing Deposit facility (SDF), but were rarely at the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) window since the last MPC in May. In addition, prime lending rate was steady at 165 percent between May and June, suggesting that care must be taken to manage the structural liquidity and the structural impediments to credit growth in the economy. These developments coupled with anticipated upward inflationary pressure would suggest that monetary easing at this time may be counter-productive. While pressure at foreign exchange has eased, there are some downside risks. Inflationary pressure has persisted in the last consecutive four months and the projection is trending upwards. In an election year coupled with fragile and uncertain global environment, macroeconomic stability is very important. Based on these. I vote for a hold on Monetary Policy Rate, the maintenance of 75 percent increase in public sector deposits Cash Reserve 23 Requirement (CRR) and a 15 percent increase in private sector Cash Reserve Requirement. .0 BALAMI. DAHIRU HASSAN On the basis of the review of the macro economic data on the current situation of the economy. I voted to hold the current monetary policy rate of 12 percent, cash reserve ratio of 75 percent for public deposit, and 15 percent for private sector deposit with symmetric corridor of +/-2 percent be maintained. REASONS Global Economy The global economy is fairly establish with favorable growth recovery in the US and Japan with improving employment figures. Although the picture in the Euro zone is weaker with only the Germany economy fairly better. For China, its growth rate at is about 75 percent and largely stable. In Africa the growth remains strong for most of the countries. Some tools to stimulate the European economy are being put in place. Global prices are subdued to the 24 fact that inflation is currently lower than policy goals. The implication of the above is that import inflation is not a problem to the Nigerian economy for now. However progressive tapering of QE3 in the United States of America poses some challenges to the management of exchange rate, foreign reserves and the financial as a whole. The international price for crude oil has been steady. The threats to Nigerian oil revenue exist due to share oil and gas from the US and other countries. Domestic Economy The Nigerian economy has witnessed a robust growth of about 62 percent in 2014 Q1. The prospects for sustaining the growth are high because of stable oil price, and other supporting policies in other sectors of the economy which include agriculture, industrial sectors and energy. However the greatest problems to growth in the economy are: the current insecurity in the north eastern region of Nigeria; high unemployment rate; oil theft and vandalisation of oil and gas infrastructure. On a good note is the high level of robustness 25 of the banking sector in Nigeria; stable prices; exchange rate and financial sector. However the gap between private deposits and lending rate is a source of concern. There are questions that need to be asked and answered as to the consequences of reducing the interest rate in the near future. Although high interest kills businesses, interest cannot be reduced now partly because most banks invest huge sums of money in providing security, power generations, leases of operating premises, as well as inflationary pressures. If interest rate is reduced, the environment may be too harsh for many banks to operate. There may be out flow of FDI which the economy currently needs. CONCLUSION The prospect of growth in Nigeria remains strong; however the growth has to be pro job creation. This would reduce the level of unemployment, inequality and level of poverty in the economy thereby raising the welfare of the people. The stability in the financial sector has been achieved at the expense of strategic sacrifice of monetary policy independence for exchange rate 26 stability at the risk of medium term macro and financial system stability. It is not appropriate to cut the interest rate. .0 DANIEL-NWAOBIA. ANASTASIA The performance of the domestic economy has remained impressive, given the current level of the macroeconomic indicators. For instance the real GDP grew at 621% in the first quarter of 2014; the year-on-year inflation rate, in spite of the rising trend since February, 2014 remained at single digit of 82% in June, driven largely by the rise in food prices. The naira exchange rate at the Retail Dutch Action Spot (rDAS-SPT) segment remained steady at $/N15729 between May 20, 2014 and July 18, 2014, while the external reserves level stood at U$4020 billion as at July 17, 2014, which could cover approximately 7 months of imports. The outlook for domestic output in the coming months is positive, given the various efforts by the Government to enhance domestic output such as: the successful implementation of the Growth Enhancement Scheme (GES) which was designed to guarantee 27 timely supply of inputs to farmers on a sustainable basis; and Government's renewed efforts at curbing crude oil theft, as well as addressing the challenges of the energy sector. Furthermore the continued improvement in global output would have positive impact on Nigeria's oil export and public revenue if government intensifies current effort to curb leakages in the oil sector. However increase in US oil output and export may dampen demand for Nigeria's crude, especially in Europe. Staff estimates project a gradual increase in the inflation rate over the next six months based on: acceleration in food inflation due to seasonal effect of the expected increase in prices and demand for staples; expected growth in reserve money and depreciation in the BDC rate. However the current efforts by the CBN to sanitize the BDC segment of the foreign exchange market could minimize the exchange rate effect on inflation. The year-on-year inflation was projected to remain within single digit in the next six months. 28 The relative stability in the official foreign exchange market is expected to subsist through the third quarter of 2014 with sustained intervention by the CBN. The current effort by the Bank to tackle foreign exchange volatility with increased capitalization of the BDC and curtailing retail currency importation would enhance the stability of the exchange rate in the market. Pressure points to note, however include: sustaining the stability of the naira exchange rate; managing capital flows, especially the volatile portfolio investments and potential reversals as tapering nears its end in September, 2014; high lending rates and wide interest rate spread; election related expenditure in 2014/15 which could heighten the liquidity profile in the economy; and building of fiscal buffers to insure against global shocks. In spite of the concerns expressed above, the current relative impressive performance of the economy as well as the outlook in the near to medium term confirm the effectiveness of the current tight 29 monetary policy stance, particularly in keeping inflation within single digits as well as maintaining stability in the foreign exchange market. It is, therefore advisable to sustain the current policy stance. Consequently I vote as follows: The Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to be retained at the current level of 12% and corridor of +/- 2% for the inter- meeting period. The Private sector CRR should also be retained at 15 per cent, given the current banking system liquidity profile. The current policy on foreign exchange (mid-point and exchange rate band of N155/US$1 +/- 3%) should be retained, while the CBN continues to intervene to stabilize the rates, when necessary. The Federal Government is already making efforts at rebuilding the fiscal buffers required to sustain the stability of the exchange rate. It is my strong belief that the fiscal and monetary authorities will continue to work closely to sustain the macroeconomic and price stability that will engender growth and create jobs. 30 50 GARBA. ABDUL-GANIYU I vote:  to maintain MPR at 12%;  to maintain Private Sector CRR at 15% and Public Sector CRR at 75%  to maintain Liquidity Ratio at 30%  for asymmetric corridor of -5% (Standing Deposit Facility) and +2 (Standing Lending Facility). This implies that I am voting for the same policy set I voted for at the last meeting in May 19-20, 2014. Maintaining MPR. CRR (private). CRR (public) and Liquidity Ratio at current levels takes due cognizance of the trend of key macroeconomic indicators (growth, inflation, unemployment, fiscal deficit and public debt, external reserves, capital flows, money survey, oil price, etc); the economic report and inflation forecast by Bank Staff for the last two quarters of 2014; expectations of economic actors and open economy macroeconomic analysis of Nigeria's current policy regimes. The vote also takes due cognizance of the global economic outlook for 2014 particularly, the risks associated with the US Fed's tapering and, the high likelihood of transition from inflationary to deflationary policy by the US Fed and the Bank of England as price levels begin to rise. 31 In the short term, keeping MPR. CRR on private sector deposit. CRR on public sector deposit. Liquidity Ratio and the SLF rate unchanged offer some relative stability for economic agents to implement their economic plans for 2014. It also provides the MPC with the opportunity to develop forward looking medium term strategy to adapt seamlessly to a post quantitative easing phase and to repair the transmission mechanism of monetary policy which has been weakened by th"
Hungary,2014-07-22,"At its meeting on 22 July 2014, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 20 basis points from 2.30% to 2.10%, with effect from 23 July 2014. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening, output remains below potential and is likely to approach that level in the course of next year. Despite the pick-up in domestic demand, capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungary's export markets. With employment rising, the unemployment rate is falling, but still exceeds its long-term level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Based on the inflation data for June, consumer prices continue to show historically low dynamics. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation capturing the medium-term outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy, reflecting low inflation in external markets, the degree of unused capacity in the economy, subdued wage dynamics, the fall in inflation expectations and the reductions in administered prices, implemented in a series of steps. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact and low inflation is likely to persist for a sustained period. However, domestic demand-side disinflationary pressures are weakening gradually as activity gathers pace, and inflation is likely to reach levels around 3 per cent consistent with price stability at the end of the forecast horizon. Based on data available since the latest interest rate decision, economic growth continued, as reflected in data for industrial production and retail trade. In the Council's judgement, the Hungarian economy returned to a growth path in 2013. Looking ahead, economic growth may continue in a more balanced pattern than previously, with the recovery in domestic demand likely to make a greater contribution. Investment is likely to continue accelerating, reflecting the increasing use of EU funding and the easing in credit constraints also due to the Bank's Funding for Growth Scheme. Household consumption is also likely to grow gradually, mainly as a result of the expected increase in the real value of disposable income and the reduced need for deleveraging. However, propensity to save is expected to remain above levels seen prior to the crisis. Based on labour market data for May, the number of employees, excluding those employed under public employment programmes, remained broadly unchanged relative to the previous month, and the unemployment rate fell. The labour market is expected to become tighter. International investor sentiment was volatile in the past month, mainly reflecting the escalation of geopolitical conflicts and weaker-than-expected European macroeconomic data. Hungarian risk premia remained broadly unchanged in the period and the forint exchange rate depreciated slightly, with country-specific factors playing a role, in addition to external factors. Hungary's persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. The announcement of the Bank's self-financing concept may contribute to an improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the domestic economy. In the Council's judgement, a cautious approach to policy is warranted due to uncertainty about future developments in the global financial environment. In the Council's judgement, there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the monetary policy horizon. In the Council's judgement, it was justified to end the easing cycle because of the need to remove uncertainty about the bottom of the interest rate path, and the medium-term achievement of price stability made it necessary to implement a further 20 basis point reduction in interest rates. The Council judges that the central bank base rate has reached a level which ensures the medium-term achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support for the economy. That means that the two-year easing cycle of a significant cumulative reduction of 490 basis points has ended. Looking ahead, the macroeconomic outlook points in the direction of persistently loose monetary conditions."
Russia,2014-07-25,"On 25 July 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to raise the the Bank of Russia key rate to 8.0 percent per annum. Inflation deceleration in July 2014 has been slower than expected. At the same time, inflation risks have increased due to a combination of factors, including, inter alia, the aggravation of geopolitical tension and its potential impact on the ruble exchange rate dynamics, as well as potential changes in tax and tariff policy. The build-up of these risks will lead to inflation expectations remaining heightened and creates threats of inflation exceeding the target in the coming years. The adopted decision is aimed at slowing the consumer price growth to the 4.0% target level in the medium term. If high inflation risks persist, the Bank of Russia will continue raising the key rate. In June 2014, the year-on-year consumer price growth rate increased to 7.8% and core inflation grew to 7.5%. Meanwhile, inflation expectations stayed elevated. The main reason for inflation acceleration was the effect of the observed ruble depreciation on prices of a wide range of goods and services. Moreover, there were a number of specific factors boosting prices for some food items. July has seen signs of inflation slowdown. However, deceleration in consumer price growth has been slower than expected. The annual consumer price growth rate stood at estimated 7.5% as of 21 July. Inflation deceleration was mainly caused by lower increases in administered prices and utility tariffs. Price growth rates for other goods and services have stabilised as a result of decreasing impact of ruble depreciation seen in January-March 2014 on consumer prices, along with improved conditions in food markets due to, inter alia, the new harvest coming in. Monetary conditions have been tightening since March 2014, inter alia due to geopolitical factors. Interest rates on bank loans and ruble deposits increased. Lending growth slowed down slightly following the acceleration in the previous months. The year-on-year money supply growth rate has decreased which sets conditions for a decline in inflation in the medium term. Over Q2 2014 the moderate recovery of economic activity has been observed. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, the GDP growth rate was close to zero in Q2 following negative figures earlier. Low economic growth rates are largely caused by structural factors. Utilisation of production factors — labor force and commercially viable production capacities — is high. Labour productivity growth is sluggish. Due to the demographic trends labour force shortage will continue to affect economic growth in the long term. Along with structural factors, external political uncertainty has a negative impact on economic activity. Investment demand remains weak amid low business confidence, limited access to long-term financing in both international and domestic markets, and declining profits in the real sector. Besides, consumer activity is cooling. Economic slack in most countries that are Russia's trading partners does not contribute to acceleration in economic growth. At the same time, persistently high oil prices support domestic economy. Under the scenario of no negative shocks, annual inflation will decline in the second half of 2014. The factors of inflation decline are exhausted impact of ruble depreciation seen in January-March 2014 on consumer prices, lower scale of increase in administered prices and tariffs, expected good harvest, as well as subdued aggregate demand with aggregate output of goods and services remaining below potential. At the same time, there is an increased probability of negative trends which may result in inflation acceleration. These shocks include aggravation of geopolitical tension, adjustments in monetary policy of foreign central banks and the potential impact of those factors on national currency exchange rate dynamics, tax and tariff policy changes under discussion. Against this background the adopted decision will set conditions for a decline in annual consumer price growth rates to 6.0-6.5% by the end of 2014 and to the target level of 4.0% in the medium term. If high inflation risks persist, the Bank of Russia will continue raising the key rate. The next meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors on the key rate is scheduled for 12 September 2014. The press-release on the Bank of Russia Board of Directors' decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Israel,2014-07-28,"There was a decline in the inflation environment this month. Inflation measured over the preceding 12 months declined, as expected, to a level of 0.5 percent, below the lower bound of the target range. The CPI excluding the housing component declined by 0.2 percent over that period. Since the April CPI was published, there has been a decline in inflation expectations for all terms, and short-term expectations approached the lower bound of the target range. Indicators of real economic activity which became available this month indicate continued moderate growth, similar to previous quarters. With that, they refer to the period before the deterioration of the security situation; its moderating effect cannot yet be estimated. Weakness continues in goods exports, against the background of the virtual standstill in world trade and the cumulative appreciation, with moderation in high technology exports. Weakness is also apparent in private consumption over recent months. Labor force survey data indicate stability, and the growth in the number of employee posts has halted. The shekel strengthened by 0.8 percent this month in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and has appreciated by about 2 percent for the year to date. The real exchange rate is at a level that weighs on growth in the tradable industries: exports and import substitutes, particularly in light of the virtual standstill in world trade. This month, the IMF again reduced its global growth and world trade forecasts for 2014, while leaving the 2015 projections unchanged. In Europe, against the background of continued low inflation, the ECB reiterated its commitment to accommodative monetary policy for an extended period of time, and in the US the tapering process continues, while the assessment remains that the federal funds target rate will not be increased until the middle of 2015. Home prices continued to increase in April-May, and the rate ofnew mortgages taken out remained elevated, while the risk characteristics of those mortgages continued to decline due to steps taken by the Supervisor of Banks. The number of housing transactions declined sharply. Corporate bond spreads continued to widen, but they are still at a low level. This month, there were net withdrawals from corporate bond mutual funds. To view this press release as a Word document. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June increased by 0.3 percent, slightly above forecasters' projections for an increase of 0.2 percent, on average. There was a relatively large seasonal increase in the clothing and footwear component, and a marked decline in the fruit and vegetables component. The inflation rate over the preceding 12 months was 0.5 percent, and the CPI excluding thehousing component declined by 0.2 percent over that period. The tradable goods components of the CPI declined by 1.2 percent over the past 12 months. The rate of increase in components consisting of nontradable products alsomoderated, and they increased by only 1.4 percent. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for August 2014 will be published on August 11, 2014. The decisionregarding the interest rate for September 2014 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. August 25, 2014. Inflation and interest rate forecasts:A gradual but continued decline can be seen in inflation expectations derived from various sources since the April CPI was published. Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings declined slightly this month, to 1.3 percent on average. Inflation expectations for the coming year derived from the capital market declined to 1.2 percent (seasonally adjusted), and two-year projections declined to 1.5 percent. (In the recent period there has been a difficulty in calculating 1-year expectations because there aren't CPI-indexed bond series for that range.) Expectations for the next 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates declined to 1 percent. Inflation expectations for medium and long terms were virtually unchanged this month, after they declined markedly since the April CPI was published, and expectations for medium terms remained below the midpoint of the inflation target range. Most forecasters are of the opinion that the interest rate will not be reduced in the coming quarter. The makam and Telbor curves indicate some probability of one interest rate reduction in the coming three months. Real economic activity: Data on real economic activity which became available this month refer to the period before the beginning of Operation Protective Edge, and they indicate that the economy continues to grow at a moderate rate, similar to that of previous quarters. It is still too early to tell the economic effects of the security situation, but the effect of security events of similar magnitude in the past decade turned out to be a moderate macroeconomic impact, up to about 0.5 percent of GDP (in the Second Lebanon War). The recovery from previousevents was generally rapid, but the negative impact on some industries, particularly the tourism industry, is liable to last longer. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.1 percent in June: its growth rate was moderated by the trade and services revenue indices and by goodsexports. Against the background of an absence of growth in world trade, goods exports (excluding ships and automobiles and diamonds, in dollar terms)declined by 9 percent in the second quarter, after an increase of 3 percent in the first quarter. This was the result of moderation in high technology and medium-high technology exports, led by declines in exports of pharmaceuticals and chemicals. Goods imports (excluding ships and aircraft, diamonds, and fuels, in dollar terms) remained virtually unchanged in the second quarter. Services exports continued to grow, and they increased by 0.7 percent in April-May compared with the first quarter. Revenue from trade and services industries continued to moderate, declining by 1.3 percent in April-May compared with the first quarter. The various indices ofexpectations this month are based on surveys conducted before Operation Protective Edge began. Consumer confidence indices for June were mixed: those compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics and Bank Hapoalim declined, after increasing in recent months, while the Globes index was stable. The Purchasing Managers Index declined sharply and returned to the range indicating contraction of activity. The labor market: Labor Force Survey data in recent months have indicated stability; among the principal working ages (25-64), in May, the participation rate was 79.6 percent and the employment rate was 75.5 percent, and in April-May they remained virtually unchanged compared with the first quarter. The unemployment rate in May for that age range was 5.2 percent, and its average level over April-May increased slightly after declining in the first quarter. The overall unemployment rate was 5.9 percent in May. The number of employee posts did not increase in February-April compared with the preceding three months (seasonally adjusted data), the result of a 0.4 percent decline in the number of employee posts in the business sector in contrast with an increase of 0.6 percent in the number of employee posts in public services. The job vacancy rate increased by 4 percent in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Nominal and real wages increased by 0.6 percent in February-April, compared to the preceding three months (November-January, seasonally adjusted data). Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of total wage payments in the economy, were 5.3 percent higher in May-June, on a nominal basis, than in the correspondingtwo months of the previous year. Budget data: Since the beginning of 2014, the deficit in the government's domestic activity (excluding net credit) was about NIS 2.3 billion, which is about NIS 4.5 billion smaller than the deficit in the seasonal path consistent with meeting the deficit target for 2014, because the level of expenditure is below the seasonalpath consistent with full performance of the budget: domestic expenditures (excluding credit) in January-June were about NIS 5.8 billion lower than the path. Tax revenues in June were similar, in real terms, to those in June last year (excluding legislative changes and one-time revenues, and excluding extraordinary activities). Gross domestic VAT receipts, net of legislative changes, one-time revenues, and extraordinary activitieswere 0.4 percent lower in real terms in June than in the corresponding month of last year. It is still too early to assess the effects of Operation Protective Edge on the budget, in terms of both direct defense expenditures and the cost of compensation and lost tax revenues. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on June 22, 2014, through July 25, 2014, theshekel strengthened by 0.5 percent against the dollar and by 1.5 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel strengthened by about 0.8 percent this month. For the year to date, the effective exchange rate has strengthened by about 2 percent. On global markets the dollar traded mixed this month. The capital and money markets: No notable effect of the security situation was felt on financial markets. From the monetary policy discussion on June 22, 2014, through July 25, 2014, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by 0.5 percent, similar to the global trend. In the government bond market, the yield curve of CPI-indexed bonds flattened this month, and the unindexed-bond yield curve declined by up to 10 basis points. The yield on 10-year unindexed bonds declined by about 8 basis points, to 2.76 percent. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and corresponding 10-year US Treasury securities widened slightly, to 30 basis points, but still remains at a low level compared with recent years. Makam yields increased slightly along the entire curve, and the 1-year yield is 0.64 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread increased by about 12 basis points, to 90 basis points, after a prolonged decline over the past year. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in June, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public anddemand deposits) increased by 17.3 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 7.7 percent. The credit markets: Total outstanding debt of the business sector increased by about NIS 5.5 billion (0.7 percent) in May, to NIS 786 billion, primarily as a result of net (nonbank) debt raised. In the past two months, a halt can be seen in the trend of decline in business sector debt. In June, the nonfinancial business sector issued bonds totaling about NIS 3.6 billion, compared with a monthly average of NIS 3.1 billion over the past year. Corporate bond market spreads increasedsince June, and for the first time since 2012 there was a monthly negativenet new investment in corporate bond mutual funds. However, it is too early to determine if this is a change in trend. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 3.2 billion (0.8 percent) in May, to about NIS 417 billion. Half of that increase derives from housing debt. In June, new mortgages taken out totaled about NIS 4.6 billion, so that monthly new mortgage volume remained at its elevated level. There was an additional slight decline in risk characteristics of new mortgages due to the steps taken by the Supervisor of Banks. In June, the interest rate on new mortgages taken out declined for all indexation tracks: the average interest rate on new CPI-indexed loans declined by about 0.07 percentage points, and the interest rate on new unindexed loans declined by about 0.02 percentage points. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.3 percent inJune. In the 12 months ending in June, this component increased by 2.3 percent, a similar rate to that of the previous two months. Home prices, whichare measured in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices butare not included in the CPI, increased by 0.5 percent in April-May. Over the 12 months ending in May, home prices increased by 8.8 percent, compared with an increase of 8 percent in the 12 months ended in April. In the 12 months ended in April, there were 45,800 building starts and 41,900 building completions. The number of new homes built through private initiative that remain for sale increased by 5 percent in April-May compared to the first quarter, reaching a historically high level. In April, the number of transactions declined by 25 percent compared to March, and preliminary indications are that this low level was maintained in May as well. The global economy: The IMF again revised its 2014 global growth and global trade forecasts downward: by 0.3 percent. The forecast was reduced for both advanced and developing economies. In contrast, the forecast for 2015 remained unchanged. In May, the first quarter's trend of contraction in world trade continued. Assessments regarding the US are that the negative growth in the first quarter will not affect the GDP growth rate during the rest of the year, which will total 3 percent, so that growth for the full year of 2014 will be about 1.7 percent. The recent positive trend in business activity in the US continues, and is reflected both in data on economic activity and in activity surveys. In the labor market, total nonfarm payroll employment increased by agreater-than-expected 288,000 in June, and the unemployment rate declined to 6.1 percent. With that, salaries are increasing at a moderate pace, and assessments are that the low unemployment rate derives from the fact that many unemployed individuals have stopped looking for work. There are also indications of improvement in personal consumption expenditure and in consumer confidence. Inflation remains below 2 percent, and assessments are that the tapering process will continue as planned, and that the interest rate will only begin to be increased in the middle of 2015. This month, the Federal Reserve Chair emphasized that the interest rate tool is primarily intended to support inflation and employment targets, and less so to support financial stability. Weakness continues in Europe's economy: Manufacturing data were disappointing, the recovery in the employment market is very moderate, and the unemployment rate remains at 11.6 percent with a decline in the number of unemployed persons. Retail sales and consumer confidence indices, which serve as an indication of private consumption, weakened this month, but are still high compared to the period since the beginning of the crisis. Inflation in the eurozone remained low this month. The ECB did not change eurozone monetary policy this month, but repeated its commitment to low interest rates for a prolonged period, and its readiness to make use ofunconventional policy tools. Second quarter data in Japan: high inflation and expectations of negative growth: were affected by the increase in VAT in April, and assessments are that moderate growth will resumeat a later time. Developing economies presented a relatively positive picture this month, against the background of low volatility in the markets andcontinued accommodative policy in Europe and the US. In China, the economygrew by 7.5 percent in annual terms during the second quarter, higher thanexpectations and in line with the target set by authorities. Oil prices declined by 6.1 percent this month, and the commodities index excluding energy declined by 4.1 percent. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to reduce the interest rate for August 2014 by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.5 percent, is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. Concurrently the Bank has decided to narrow the interest rate corridor in the credit window and the commercial bank deposit window from C 2B 10.5 percent to C 2B 10.25 percent. The following are the main considerationsunderlying the decision: There was a decline in the inflation environment this month. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for August 2014 will be published on August 11, 2014.

Mongolia,2014-07-30,"THE BANK OF MONGOLIA MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Monetary policy decision Number: 2014/02 Effective date: 31 July 2014 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) decided to increase its policy interest rate by 1.5 percentage point to 12%, at the recurrent meeting on July 30, 2014. As of June 2014, annual inflation measured by CPI has reached at 14.6% nationwide and 15.1% in Ulaanbaatar city. Thanks to the previous policy measures to stabilize the overall economy and maintain main consumer goods' price stability, direct inflationary impacts and contributions of those goods on headline inflation has significantly been declined by 5.5 times compared to the annual average of 2010-2012. However, foreign direct investments and net foreign assets have been declining for the last 2 years, whilst quasi-fiscal expenditures have been unalleviated. In addition, the measures on increasing foreign exchange inflows and improving balance of payments have still not been sufficient. Therefore, the MPC has made this decision to increase tugrug yield in order to relieve the balance of payments difficulty, curb inflationary pressure, ensure financial stability in the medium and long term, prevent from potential risks in macroeconomic stability, and protect the real income of individuals. The outstanding balance of BOM's program loans, excluding the sustainable mortgage financing program, is expected to decrease by 766 billion tugrug at the end of this year. Therewith, the monetary policy decision shall be more effective along with the implementation of prudent and consolidated fiscal policy, which includes quasi-fiscal expenditures. It has still been crucial to enhance foreign exchange inflows through increasing export proceeds and promoting foreign direct investments, and maintain fiscal stability in order to neutralize the balance of payments pressure and to overcome current economic challenges. Concise minutes of the MPC meeting will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Philippines,2014-07-30,"Statement by BSP Governor Amando M Tetangco. Jr. At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to increase the BSP's key policy rates by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 5.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs and RPs were also raised accordingly. The rate on special deposit accounts (SDA) was left unchanged. Meanwhile, the reserve requirement ratios were also kept steady. The Monetary Board's decision is a preemptive response to signs of inflation pressures and elevated inflation expectations. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that the inflation target could be at risk, as the forecasts have shifted closer toward the higher end of the target range of 3±1 percent for 2015. At the same time, the balance of risks to the inflation outlook continues to be tilted toward the upside, with price pressures emanating from higher food prices, short-term volatility in international oil prices, and pending petitions for adjustments in power rates and transport fares. Moreover, while inflation expectations remain within target, they are seen to be settling toward the upper end of the inflation target range, particularly for 2015. The Monetary Board also sees the increase in policy rates as a preemptive measure in the context of the eventual normalization of monetary policy in some advanced economies. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that an increase in the BSP's policy rates will moderate inflation pressures and arrest potential second-round effects by helping anchor inflation expectations. The Monetary Board noted that the continued favorable outlook for domestic demand allows some scope for a measured adjustment in policy rates without adversely affecting the country's economic growth prospects. Going forward, the BSP will remain vigilant against risks to price and financial stability and stands ready to undertake further policy actions as necessary."
United States,2014-07-30,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that growth in economic activity rebounded in the second quarter. Labor market conditions improved, with the unemployment rate declining further. However, a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources. Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has moved somewhat closer to the Committee's longer-run objective. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat. The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in August, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $10 billion per month rather than $15 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $15 billion per month rather than $20 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Stanley Fischer; Richard W Fisher; Narayana Kocherlakota; Loretta J Mester; Jerome H Powell; and Daniel K Tarullo. Voting against was Charles I Plosser who objected to the guidance indicating that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for ""a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends,"" because such language is time dependent and does not reflect the considerable economic progress that has been made toward the Committee's goals.

Czech Republic,2014-07-31,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. The forecast is based on the assumption of flat market interest rates at their current very low level and the use of the koruna exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument until 2015 Q3. The subsequent return to conventional monetary policy will not imply appreciation of the exchange rate to the level recorded before the CNB started intervening, as the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to prices and other nominal variables. According to the forecast, inflation will gradually increase from its current very low levels and return to the 2% target in 2015 H2. The Bank Board assesses the risks to this outlook as being slightly anti-inflationary and states that the Czech National Bank will not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2016. Turning to the assumptions of the forecast regarding developments abroad, external economic activity should gradually pick up pace this year and the next. By contrast, a modest slowdown is assumed for 2016. Prices of foreign industrial producers are falling markedly this year, reflecting an observed decline in world prices of energy and agricultural commodities coupled with the impacts of the previous lengthy economic downturn and appreciation of the euro against the dollar. Producer prices in the euro area will show weak growth in the longer term only. Consumer prices will also rise only slightly owing to the slowly recovering demand. The very subdued inflation in the euro area and the resulting recent monetary policy easing by the European Central Bank are reflected in a low outlook for three-month euro area interbank interest rates, which should rise slightly in 2016. Overall, the outlook for the euro area has shifted noticeably towards lower inflation and easier monetary policy. The price of Brent crude oil rose temporarily in the previous quarter, shifting the entire outlook upwards. Even according to this outlook, however, oil prices will start falling gradually. The euro is expected to depreciate gradually against the US dollar from its current relatively strong level. The expected modest decline in world prices of energy combined with the evolution of the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar still does not imply significant cost-push inflation pressures. As regard developments in the Czech economy, the current exceptionally low inflation reflects the very subdued inflation in the euro area, a continuing decline in administered prices and slowing food price growth. Core inflation, by contrast, turned positive for the first time in many years and is accelerating further. This is a result of the weakening of the koruna, which supported rapid growth in domestic economic activity and a positive change in the labour market. According to the forecast, headline inflation will start rising gradually in 2014 Q3 and return to the 2% target in 2015 H2. It will then stay close to the target in 2016. The inflationary effect of import prices will fade this year owing to subdued inflation abroad amid a stable exchange rate of the koruna. In the second half of this year, by contrast, the domestic economy will start to contribute to inflation, chiefly as a result of accelerating wage growth. Average inflation will be 0.4% this year and increase to 1.8% next year. Both levels are 0.4 percentage point lower than in the previous forecast. Monetary-policy relevant inflation, i.e. inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, will follow a similar path to headline inflation, but at a slightly lower level. It will thus stay just below the CNB's target at the monetary policy horizon. Following a decline in the previous two years, the Czech economy will grow by almost 3% this year according to the forecast. Economic growth will be fostered by recovering external demand, the easing of the domestic monetary conditions via the weakened exchange rate, and higher government investment. In the following two years, the economy will record similar growth rates as this year, with investment financed from EU funds making a significantly positive contribution in 2015 and a slightly negative contribution in 2016. The economic recovery is already manifesting itself in the labour market in renewed growth in the number of employees converted into full-time equivalents. This growth will rise further. The share of unemployed persons will decline gradually over the entire forecast horizon. Wage growth in the business sector should start to pick up pace significantly in 2014 H2. The forecast expects market interest rates to be flat at their current very low level until 2015 Q3, reflecting the 2W repo rate being left at technical zero and an unchanged money market premium. Market rates are forecasted to increase by around 0.5 percentage point at the end of next year after the exit from the regime of using the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument. Interest rates will then rise further. The forecasts for headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation are lower than in the previous prediction owing to lower outlooks for administered price inflation and net inflation. GDP growth has been revised upwards in 2014, mainly as a result of a faster expected recovery in private investment and stronger household consumption. In 2015, by contrast. GDP growth will be slightly slower compared to the previous forecast on account of less expansionary fiscal policy. The expected growth rate of nominal wages in the business sector this year has shifted higher, reflecting higher wage growth at the start of the year and stronger growth in economic activity. The interest rate path is lower, mainly reflecting a stronger anti-inflationary effect of the external environment and administered prices and a related postponement of the expected exit from the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument."
Romania,2014-08-04,"The NBR examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report which will be presented to the public in a news conference scheduled for August 6, 2014. The analysis of the latest macroeconomic data shows the annual inflation rate remaining on a downward path and temporarily running below the lower bound of the variation band of the flat target. The new projected inflation path is significantly lower than that forecasted in May. Behind this stood one-off factors (the dynamics of volatile food prices, the nominal appreciation of the local currency, the influence of import prices partly reflecting subdued euro area inflation) overlapping with the persistent effects of the negative output gap and the downward adjustment in inflation expectations. The annual inflation rate fell to a new historic low of 0.66 percent in June 2014 from 0.94 percent in the previous month and 1.55 percent in December 2013. At the same time, the average annual inflation rate came in at 1.7 percent in June 2014 compared to 2.1 percent in May. The average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices  which is relevant for ensuring comparability at European level and assessing convergence with the European Union  continued to decrease, reaching 1.5 percent in June versus 1.8 percent in May. Romania thus ranks among the countries meeting the corresponding nominal convergence criterion at EU level. The improvement in economic activity in Romania has further been fostered by the favourable performance of industrial output, fuelled mainly by external demand growth and the gradually rebounding domestic demand, amid a further narrow current account deficit. The international reserves remain in a comfortable zone while a substantial part of the IMF loan under the 2009-2011 arrangement has been repaid. The annual dynamics of total credit to the private sector fell deeper into negative territory, solely on account of the steeper decline in the rate of change of the foreign currency component, whereas the annual pace of increase in real terms of leu-denominated credit gained momentum and peaked at a five-year high in June. Consequently, the share of foreign exchange loans in total credit to the private sector (stocks) continued to narrow to 58 percent at end-June 2014 against 62 percent in June 2013, thus helping consolidate the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which points to the outlook for the annual inflation rate to run at markedly lower readings than previously forecasted, i.e. below the midpoint of the flat target until mid-2015 and in the upper half of the variation band in the latter part of the projection horizon. According to the new projection, the annual inflation rate will be 2.2 percent at end-2014 and 3 percent at end-2015, while the average annual inflation rate is anticipated to stand at 1.4 percent in 2014 and 2.4 percent in 2015. Similarly to the previous assessments, the risks associated with this outlook stem chiefly from external sources, being largely generated by possibly higher volatility of capital flows in Romania following unfavourable developments in investors' risk aversion to the emerging economies. This could materialise amid the recent geopolitical and regional tensions, the ongoing cross-border deleveraging and restructuring of some Eurozone banking groups, as well as in the context of uncertainty surrounding the impact of possible monetary policy stance adjustments by major central banks worldwide. Domestically, the main risks relate to the persistence of uncertainties about the consistent implementation of the set of structural reforms and other measures agreed with international institutions in the context of elections later this year. Against this background, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 3.25 percent per annum from 3.50 percent previously. Hence, starting with 5 August 2014, the interest rate on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard) will fall to an annual 6.25 percent from 6.50 percent and its deposit facility rate will stand at 0.25 percent per annum. The NBR Board has also decided to continue to pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions, reiterating that their harmonisation with European levels over the medium term will carry on gradually, at an appropriate pace and time, conditional on the economic and financial environment domestically and externally. These decisions help attain the overriding objective of preserving medium-term price stability as well as financial stability, together with paving the way for balanced and lasting economic growth. In this context, the consistent implementation of an adequate macroeconomic policy mix, in line with the provisions of the external financing arrangements, and the resumption, by observing prudential rules, of financial intermediation in parallel with an appropriate remuneration of bank deposits, conducive to fostering domestic saving, are pivotal to consolidating favourable prospects for the Romanian economy, thereby enhancing its resilience to external shocks. The NBR monitors closely the domestic and global economic developments so as, by calibrating the monetary policy conduct and making adequate use of its available tools, to maintain medium-term price stability and preserve financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a news conference on 6 August 2014. According to the approved calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 30 September 2014.

India,2014-08-05,"Third Bi-Monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2014-15 By Dr.Raghuram G. Rajan. Governor Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.0 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL); reduce the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks by 50 basis points from 22.5 per cent to 22.0 per cent of their NDTL with effect from the fortnight beginning August 9, 2014; and continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL and liquidity under 7-day and 14-day term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 9.0 per cent. Assessment 2. Since the second bi-monthly monetary policy statement of June 2014, global economic activity has been picking up at a modest space from a sharp slowdown in Q1. Investor risk appetite has buoyed financial markets, partly drawing strength from assurances of continuing monetary policy support in industrial countries. Portfolio flows to emerging market economies (EMEs) have risen strongly. This implies, however, that EMEs remain vulnerable to changes in investor risk appetite driven by any reassessment of the future path of US monetary policy or possible escalation of geopolitical tensions. Sentiment on domestic economic activity appears to be reviving, with incoming data suggesting a firming up of industrial growth and exports. The June round of the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey also points to improvement in business expectations in Q2. Leading indicators of the services sector are mixed, although there are early signs of modest strengthening of corporate sales and business flows. While the initial slow progress of the monsoon and its uneven spatial distribution2 raised serious concerns regarding agricultural production, these have been mitigated, though not entirely dispelled, by the pick-up in the monsoon through much of the country in July. The implementation of government policy actions that have been announced should create a congenial setting for a steady improvement in domestic demand and supply conditions. Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) has eased for the second consecutive month in June, with a broad-based moderation accompanied by deceleration in momentum. Higher prices of vegetables, fruits and protein-based food items were offset by the muted increase in the prices of non-food items, particularly those of household requisites and transport and communication. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel decelerated further, extending the decline that began in September 2013. However, with some continuing uncertainty about the path of the monsoon, it would be premature to conclude that future food inflation, and its spill- over to broader inflation, can be discounted. Liquidity conditions have remained broadly stable, barring episodic tightness on account of movements in the cash balances of the Government maintained with the Reserve Bank. While the system's recourse to liquidity from the LAF, and regular and additional term repos has been around 1.0 per cent of the NDTL of banks, access to the MSF has been minimal and temporary. In order to manage transient liquidity pressures associated with tax outflows and sluggish spending by the Government, the Reserve Bank injected additional liquidity aggregating over 940 billion through nine special term repos of varying maturities during the months of June and July. Despite the reduction in the export credit refinance effected in early June, average utilisation of the facility has only been around 70 per cent of the available limit. The Reserve Bank will review existing liquidity arrangements and continue to monitor and manage liquidity to ensure adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors. With the buoyancy in export performance sustained through Q1, the trade deficit has narrowed from its level a year ago. While oil imports rose in June partly on higher international crude prices, gold import growth picked up in response to some liberalization of import restrictions, and non-oil non-gold import growth has turned positive since May. Turning to external financing, all categories of capital flows have been buoyant. Surges in capital inflows in excess of the current account financing requirement and the repayment of swaps by oil marketing companies have bolstered international reserves. Policy Stance and Rationale 7. The moderation in CPI headline inflation for two consecutive months, despite the seasonal firming up of prices of fruits and vegetables since March, is due to both base effects and the steady deceleration in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. The recent fall in international crude prices, the benign outlook on global non-oil commodity prices and still-subdued corporate pricing power should all support continued disinflation, as should measures undertaken to improve food management. There are, however, upside risks also, in the form of the pass-through of administered price increases, continuing uncertainty over monsoon conditions and their impact on food production, possibly higher oil prices stemming from geo-political concerns and exchange rate movement, and strengthening growth in the face of continuing supply constraints. Accordingly, the upside risks to the target of ensuring CPI inflation at or below 8 per cent by January 2015 remain, although overall risks are more balanced than in June (Chart 1). It is, therefore, appropriate to continue3 maintaining a vigilant monetary policy stance as in June, while leaving the policy rate unchanged. Prospects for reinvigoration of growth have improved modestly. The firming up of export growth should support manufacturing and service sector activity. If the recent pick-up in industrial activity is sustained in an environment conducive to the revival of investment and unlocking of stalled projects, with ongoing fiscal consolidation releasing resources for private enterprise, external demand picking up and international crude prices stabilising, the central estimate of real GDP growth of 5.5 per cent within a likely range of 5 to 6 per cent that was set out in the April projection for 2014-15 can be sustained. On the other hand, if risks relating to the global recovery, the monsoon and geo-political tensions intensify, the balance of risks could tilt to the downside (Chart 2). The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor inflation developments closely, and remains committed to the disinflationary path of taking CPI inflation to 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016. While inflation at around 8 per cent in early 2015 seems likely, it is critical that the disinflationary process is sustained over the medium-term. The balance of risks around the medium-term inflation path, and especially the target of 6 per cent by January 2016, are still to the upside, warranting4 a heightened state of policy preparedness to contain these risks if they materialise. In the months ahead, government actions on food management and to facilitate project completion should improve supply, but as consumer and business confidence pick up, aggregate demand will also strengthen. The Reserve Bank will act as necessary to ensure sustained disinflation. In the second bi-monthly monetary policy statement of June 2014, the Reserve Bank reduced the SLR to 22.5 per cent of NDTL in anticipation of recovery in economic activity. With the Union Budget for 2014-15 renewing commitment to the medium-term fiscal consolidation roadmap and budgeting 4.1 per cent of GDP as the fiscal deficit for the year, space has opened up further for banks to expand credit to the productive sectors in response to its financing needs as growth picks up. Accordingly, the SLR is reduced by a further 0.5 per cent of NDTL. In consonance with the calibrated reduction in the SLR, it is necessary to enhance liquidity in the money and debt markets so that financial intermediation expands apace with a growing economy. Currently, banks are permitted to exceed the limit of 25 per cent of total investments under the held to maturity (HTM) category provided the excess comprises only SLR securities, and banks' total holdings of SLR securities in the HTM category is not more than 24.5 per cent of their NDTL as on the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight. In order to enable banks greater participation in financial markets, this ceiling is being brought down to 24 per cent of NDTL with effect from the fortnight beginning August 9, 2014. The Reserve Bank has taken a number of steps to enhance efficiency, increase entry, speed up resolution, and improve access to financial services, such as modified regulations on long term lending and borrowing, proposals for licensing payment banks and small banks, a framework to deal with stressed assets, actions to further the use of mobile phones in banking, and efforts to simplify know your customer (KYC) norms, among others. The Reserve Bank will continue to carry forward its banking sector reforms agenda. The fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement is scheduled on Tuesday. September 30, 2014."
Thailand,2014-08-06,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 6 August 2014 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 6 August 2014 as follows. The global economy continued to improve steadily. The US economy grew at a firmer pace from accelerating domestic demand and stronger labour market. The euro area and Japan recovered slowly, entailing continued accommodative monetary policy. Growth in China and Asia stabilized on the back of improving exports to major economies. Some central banks in the region have begun to raise policy interest rates in light of domestic developments. The Thai economy showed signs of improvements in the second quarter of 2014, from private spending following the political resolution. Exports recovered modestly, while public spending fell slightly short of previous assessment. In the second half of the year, firmer domestic demand and fiscal policy, particularly public investment, should lend further impetus to growth recovery. Exports of goods and tourism are expected to expand at a subdued pace. Inflationary pressure remains contained. The committee judges that current accommodative monetary policy remains appropriate in supporting economic recovery. The policy stance is deemed consistent with long‐term financial stability, which should complement government's reform efforts to lift the economy's potential growth. The committee thus voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 200 percent per annum."
Euroarea,2014-08-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The available information remains consistent with our assessment of a continued moderate and uneven recovery of the euro area economy, with low rates of inflation and subdued monetary and credit dynamics. At the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. The monetary policy measures decided in early June have led to an easing of the monetary policy stance. This is in line with our forward guidance and adequately reflects the outlook for the euro area economy, as well as the differences in terms of the monetary policy cycle between major advanced economies. The targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) that are to take place over the coming months will enhance our accommodative monetary policy stance. These operations will provide long-term funding at attractive terms and conditions over a period of up to four years for all banks that meet certain benchmarks applicable to their lending to the real economy. This should help to ease funding conditions further and stimulate credit provision to the real economy. As our measures work their way through to the economy they will contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to 2%. As stated previously, and as a follow-up to our decision in early June, we have intensified preparatory work related to outright purchases in the asset-backed securities market to enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Looking ahead, we will maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation. Concerning our forward guidance, the key ECB interest rates will remain at present levels for an extended period of time in view of the current outlook for inflation. Moreover, the Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to also using unconventional instruments within its mandate, should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation. We are strongly determined to safeguard the firm anchoring of inflation expectations over the medium to long term. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. In the first quarter of this year euro area real GDP rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter. With regard to the second quarter, monthly indicators have been somewhat volatile, partly reflecting technical factors. Overall, recent information, including survey data available for July, remains consistent with our expectation of a continued moderate and uneven recovery of the euro area economy. Looking ahead, domestic demand should be supported by a number of factors, including the accommodative monetary policy stance and the ongoing improvements in financial conditions. In addition, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, as well as gains in real disposable income, should make a positive contribution to economic growth. Furthermore, demand for exports should benefit from the ongoing global recovery. However, although labour markets have shown some further signs of improvement, unemployment remains high in the euro area and, overall, unutilised capacity continues to be sizeable. Moreover, the annual rate of change of MFI loans to the private sector remained negative in June and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors are likely to continue to dampen the pace of the economic recovery. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside. In particular, heightened geopolitical risks, as well as developments in emerging market economies and global financial markets, may have the potential to affect economic conditions negatively, including through effects on energy prices and global demand for euro area products. A further downside risk relates to insufficient structural reforms in euro area countries, as well as weaker than expected domestic demand. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.4% in July 2014, after 0.5% in June. This reflects primarily lower energy price inflation, while the other main components of the HICP remained broadly unchanged On the basis of current information, annual HICP inflation is expected to remain at low levels over the coming months, before increasing gradually during 2015 and 2016. Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. The Governing Council sees both upside and downside risks to the outlook for price developments as limited and broadly balanced over the medium term. In this context, we will closely monitor the possible repercussions of heightened geopolitical risks and exchange rate developments. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for June 2014 continue to point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (M3), with annual growth standing at 1.5% in June, compared with 1.0% in May. The growth of the narrow monetary aggregate M1 stood at 5.3% in June, up from 5.0% in May. The increase in the MFI net external asset position, reflecting in part the continued interest of international investors in euro area assets, remained an important factor supporting annual M3 growth. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained negative at -2.3% in June, compared with -2.5% in May and -3.2% in February. Lending to non-financial corporations continues to be weak, reflecting the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. At the same time, in terms of monthly flows, loans to non-financial corporations have shown some signs of a stabilisation over recent months, after recording sizeable negative monthly flows earlier in the year. This is consistent with the results of the bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2014 in which banks reported that credit standards for loans to enterprises had eased in net terms. However, they remain rather tight overall, when seen from a historical perspective. In addition, banks reported an improvement in net loan demand by non-financial corporations and households. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.5% in June, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. Against the background of weak credit growth, the ECB's ongoing comprehensive assessment of banks' balance sheets is of key importance. Banks should take full advantage of this exercise to improve their capital position, thereby supporting the scope for credit expansion during the next stages of the recovery. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that the current low level of inflation should be followed by a gradual upward movement in HICP inflation rates towards levels closer to 2%. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. As regards fiscal policies, comprehensive fiscal consolidation in recent years has contributed to reducing budgetary imbalances. Important structural reforms have increased competitiveness and the adjustment capacity of countries' labour and product markets. These efforts now need to gain momentum to enhance the euro area's growth potential. Structural reforms should focus on fostering private investment and job creation. To restore sound public finances, euro area countries should proceed in line with the Stability and Growth Pact and should not unravel the progress made with fiscal consolidation. Fiscal consolidation should be designed in a growth-friendly way. A full and consistent implementation of the euro area's existing fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance framework is key to bringing down high public debt ratios, to raising potential growth and to increasing the euro area's resilience to shocks."
Georgia,2014-08-13,"13.08.14 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate unchanged at 4% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on August 13, 2014, and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 4%. At its February meeting, the MPC decided to start a gradual exit from the accommodative monetary policy. The speed of this process will depend on both the rate of the revival of economic activity and aggregate demand. However, since February, certain risks have materialized that have caused insufficient growth of both domestic and external demand, thus slowing down the process of inflation reaching its medium term target. The NBG still considers an exit from the accommodative monetary policy necessary. However, recent forecasts suggest that the process will take more time than originally predicted. In order to ensure that inflation reaches its target in the medium term, the committee has thus decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this stage. It should be taken into account that exiting the accommodative monetary policy will not have a limiting effect on the economy, insofar as the policy rate will remain below the neutral level. So long as new information revealed in coming periods does not affect the current forecasts and no new shocks to the economy materialize, the policy rate, along with the revival of economic growth, will gradually approach its neutral level and reach 6% by the end of 2015. According to the NBG forecasts, inflation will gradually reach 4% by the end of 2014, and will reach its target value of 5% in the first half of 2015. Annual inflation in July 2014 was slightly lower than expected at 2.8%. Real GDP growth in the first half of the year was 6%, and was mostly driven by domestic demand. External demand still remains weak, as indicated by low goods export figures in July. Given the present situation in the region, external demand still remains a risk factor. In the event of a further decrease, this will push down both economic growth and inflation. The NBG will continue to monitor developments in the economy and financial markets, both domestically and abroad, and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure price stability. The dynamics of further monetary policy changes will depend on the dynamics of expected inflation, tendencies of economic growth, and the global and regional economic environment. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on September 24, 2014."
Chile,2014-08-14,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 14 August 2014 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 3.50% (annual). Internationally, incoming information confirms the outlook of recovery of the United States, while growth in the Eurozone has lost strength. Growth forecasts for emerging Asia remain stable, while for Latin America they have been revised downward. External financial conditions continue to be favorable, but with some deterioration in recent weeks. Commodity prices have dropped, including those for copper and fuels. Local economic indicators show that the pace of expansion of output and demand has slowed more sharply than expected. The drop in investment has been compounded by a more marked slowdown in private consumption. Despite signs of less dynamism in the labor market, the unemployment rate remains low. In July, headline inflation was 4.5% annually. Twelve-month growth in nominal wages accelerated. Medium-term inflation expectations remain around 3%. The most likely scenario continues to assume that inflation will stay above the upper bound of the tolerance range still for some months, to later return to the target. This evolution will continue to be monitored with special attention. The Board will consider the possibility of making additional cuts to the monetary policy rate in line with the evolution of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions and its implications on the inflationary outlook. At the same time, the Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2014-08-14,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 2.50% to 2.25%. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 2.50% to 2.25%. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that, although the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, the euro area economic recovery still appears weak, while trends of economic growth in emerging market countries have differed from country to country. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around advanced economies, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance, by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries and by geopolitical risks. In Korea, exports have maintained their buoyancy but the Committee judges that improvements in domestic demand, which had contracted due mainly to the impacts of the Sewol ferry accident, have been insufficient, and that the consumption and investment sentiments of economic agents also continue to show sluggishness. On the employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded in line with increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will gradually narrow going forward, although its pace of narrowing will be moderate. Consumer price inflation fell from 1.7% the month before to 1.6% in July, due mainly to increases in the extents of decline in the prices of agricultural and petroleum products. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices rose slightly to 2.2%, from 2.1% in June. The Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, but judges that for the time being inflationary pressures will not be high. Housing prices in the country excluding Seoul and its surrounding areas showed a slight upward movement, while leasehold deposit prices both in Seoul and its surrounding areas and in the rest of the country continued their modest uptrends. In the domestic financial markets, after having risen substantially owing chiefly to the government's announcement of economic policies, stock prices have fallen back somewhat due for example to geopolitical risks. The Korean won has depreciated under the influence of the US dollar's strength globally, and long-term market interest rates have fallen. Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while supporting the recovery of economic growth. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as shifts in major countries' monetary policies, changes in economic agents' sentiment and movements of future economic indicators including the household debt trend, while observing the effects of this month's Base Rate cut and the government's economic policies."
Peru,2014-08-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2014 BCRP MAINTAINED THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 3.75 percent. This level of the reference rate is compatible with an inflation forecast according to which inflation will converge to the target range in 2014 and to 2.0 percent in 2015. This forecast takes into account that: inflation expectations remain anchored within the inflation target range; GDP continues to show lower growth rates than the country's potential level of growth, which is expected to be a temporary situation; recent indicators show signals of recovery in the U.S. economy, and the supply factors that led inflation to increase are moderating at a slower pace than expected. Inflation in July showed a rate of 0.43 percent, as a result of which inflation in the last 12 months fell from 3.45 percent in June to 3.33 percent in July. The rate of inflation excluding food and energy was 0.24 percent, as a result of which the rate of inflation in the last 12 months fell from 2.77 percent in June to 2.73 percent in July. Inflation is forecast to remain initially close to the upper band of the target range due to the persistent effect of the supply shocks and to converge thereafter to the 2 percent target. Current and advanced indicators of activity continue to show a weaker economic cycle than the one expected, with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output due mainly to the lower dynamism observed in investment and exports. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, and will implement additional monetary easing measures if it is necessary. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 2.55 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.55 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.55 percent. The Monetary Program for September will be approved on the Board's meeting of September 11, 2014."
Israel,2014-08-25,"There was an additionaldecline in the inflation environment this month. Inflation measured over the preceding 12 months declined to 0.3 percent, and the decline in inflation expectations for all terms continued. Forecasters' projections for the coming year, and 1-year expectations derived from the capital market,are very near the lower bound of the target range, and expectations derived from banks' internal interest rates declined below the range. Based on the first estimateof second quarter National Accounts data, there was a further slowdown in economic growth, particularly in goods exports, even before the deterioration in the security situation. There was some increase in the growth rate ofbusiness sector product compared to previous quarters. Labor market data indicate a halt to the improvement in employment. Data which have become available so far do not yet allow the assessment of the loss of GDP that will derive from the fighting, which still continues, but it occurs against the background of a slowdown in growth of the economy, and an environment of low economic growth worldwide. In particular, an extended negative impact is expected in tourism, and a negative impact, apparently temporary, in private consumption. The shekel weakened by 1.7 percent this month in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Continued depreciation will support a recovery in exports and in the tradable sector. The shekel has appreciated by about 0.4 percent since the beginning of the year. The global picture continues to indicate limited recovery, with renewed growth in the US and moderation in Europe and Japan. Major central banks are expected to continue accommodative monetary policy for an extended period of time. Home prices increased by 7.7 percent in the previous 12 months, and the rate of new mortgages taken out remains elevated. The uncertainty regarding the application of a zero VATrate on new homes continues to have an impact on housing market activity.</div>. To view this press release as a Word document. The labor market: Data which became available this month continue to indicate a halt in labor market expansion.Labor Force Survey data for the second quarter indicate an increase of 0.2 percentage points in the unemployment rate among the principal working ages (25-64), to 5.3 percent, with a decline in the employment rate by 0.3 percentage points. The overall unemployment rate increased by a similar degree, to 6 percent, and there was no change in the overall employment rate. At the same time, there was a decline in the average weekly work hoursper employed person, from 36.1 hours to 35.5 hours, due to, inter alia</i>, the expansion in part time employment at the expense of full time employment. The number of employee posts declined in March-May by 0.14 percent compared with the preceding three months (December-February, seasonally adjusted data). Nominal wages increased by 0.8 percent, and real wages increased by 0.7 percent, in March-May, compared to the preceding three months (December-February, seasonally adjusted data).Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of total wage payments in the economy, continue to indicate expansion of employment, and were 4.3 percent higher in June-July, on a nominal basis, than in the corresponding period of the previous year. Budget data: Since the beginning of the year, the deficit in the government's domestic activity (excluding net credit) was about NIS 4.7 billion, which is about NIS 2.6 billion smaller than the deficit in the seasonal path consistent with meeting the deficit target for 2014, because the level of expenditure is below the seasonal path consistent with full performance of the budget: domestic expenditures (excluding credit) in January-July were about NIS 5.2 billion lower than the path, despite a deviation of NIS 0.6 billion relative to the expenditure path in July, the result of payments to suppliers in the South being brought forward and of a supplement to the defense budget. Tax revenues in July were lower, by about NIS 1.4 billion, than the seasonal path consistent with the revenue forecast, of which NIS 0.4 billion was the result of deferring the date for tax payments by companies in the South. Indirect taxes declined, and gross domestic VAT receipts, (net of legislative changes and deferred collection due to the fighting) declined by about 0.6 percent, in real terms, compared with July 2013. The government has still not decided what the extent of the addition to the defense budget: in respect of the costs of the operation: will be, and how it will be spread out over the coming years. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on July 27, 2014, through August 22, 2014, the shekel weakened by about 2.7 percent against the dollar and by 1.4 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel weakened by about 1.7 percent this month. For the year to date, the shekel, in terms of the effective exchange rate, has strengthened by about 0.4 percent. The capital and money markets: This month as well, the security situation did not have a notable effect on financial markets. From the monetary policy discussion onJuly 27, 2014, through August 21, 2014, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by 1.2 percent, while the trend on equity markets worldwide was mixed. Yields in the government bond market declined: yields on the unindexed-bondyield curve declined by up to 20 basis points, with the yield on the 10-year unindexed bond declining by about 8 basis points to 2.72 percent. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and corresponding 10-year US Treasury securities narrowed to about 24 basis points, a low level compared with recent years. Makam yields declined along the entire curve, and the 1-year yield is 0.45 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread remained virtually unchanged at 89 basis points, despite Operation Protective Edge. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in July, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 19.0 percent, andthe M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 8.2 percent. The credit markets: Total outstanding debt of the business sector declined by about NIS 8 billion (1.0 percent) inJune, to NIS 777 billion, as a result of a decrease in outstanding bank credit and corporate bonds. In July, the nonfinancial business sector issued about NIS 2.7 billion in bonds, compared with a monthly average of NIS 3.9 billion since the beginning of the year. Net new investment in corporate bond mutual funds, which turned negative after the publication of the July interest rate notice, did not renew in August, and it appears that the interest rate reduction in August led primarily to funds being diverted from money market funds to government bond funds. Bond market spreads declined slightly, after increasing in the previous two months, and their level is still low. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 2.3 billion (0.6 percent) in June, to about NIS 419 billion: the portion of that balancewhich is made up of housing debt increased by about 1.6 percent. In July, new mortgages taken out were at an elevated level of about NIS 5 billion, as most risk characteristics continued to decline to low levels, after declining in previous months as well. In July, the interest rate on new mortgages taken out increased moderately on the indexed tracks: (0.02-0.04 percentage points), and the interest rate on unindexed tracks declined moderately (0.05-0.09 percentage points). The housingmarket: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.9 percent in July. In the 12 months ending in July, this component increased by 2.2 percent, a similar annual rate to that of the previous two months. Home prices, which are measured in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, declined by 0.2 percent in May-June, for the first time in 8 months. Over the 12 months ending in June, home prices increased by 7.7 percent, compared with an increase of 9 percent in the 12 months ended in May. The number of new homes that remain for sale declined by 2.4 percent in June compared with the previous month (seasonally adjusted data). A deferral of Israel Land Authority tenders due to Operation Protective Edge, a closure which preventedthe entrance of Palestinian workers, the shutdown of construction sites in the South due to the fighting, and the uncertainty related to the application of a zero VAT rate on new homes can all possibly negatively impact the increase in supply of homes. The number of housing transactions declined by 13 percent in the second quarter, reaching its lowest level since the trough of 2011. The global economy: The picture arising this month from the global economic data which became available continues to indicate a limited recovery, with accelerated growth in US and further moderation in Europe. The US economy grew by 4 percent (in annual terms) in the secondquarter, a higher rate than forecast, though an increase in inventories explains a large part of the growth. Purchasing manager indices indicate continued growth in the third quarter. In the past half year, nonfarm payrolls have increased to their highest level in more than 8 years, while the average salary continues to increase only moderately. The tapering process is expected to end in October, and the federal funds target rate, according to assessments, is still not expected to be increased before the second half of 2015. Eurozone GDP did not grow in the second quarter (0 percent): GDP in Germany and Italy contracted, and this was offset by positive growthin, among others. Spain and the Netherlands. The unemployment rate declined only moderately, by 0.1 percentage point, to 11.5 percent. The crisis in the Ukraine is negatively impacting sentiment in Europe. Eurozone inflationis not recovering, and in the 12 months ending in July it was 0.4 percent. The ECB emphasized that it is accelerating preparations for the possible operation of a quantitative easing program. The banking system continues to deal with significant challenges, and this month the government of Portugalannounced a rescue plan for one of the country's largest banks. InJapan. April's increase in the VAT rate led to a marked negative impact on economic activity, and GDP contracted by 6.8 percent in the secondquarter. Assessments increased that the Bank of Japan will expand the incentive program it announced earlier this year. Emerging markets presented a mixed picture this month: most of those countries benefited from low market volatility and from the improvement in the US economy. In China, some slowdown is apparent in the third quarter and inflation pressures remain low. In India, the stable recovery continues; in Brazil, the ramifications of political instability on economic activity are seen, and the crisis in the Ukraine has negative effects on Russia's economic situation. The price of a barrel of crude oil declined by about 6 percent this month, and the commodities excluding energy index declined by 2.3 percent. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to reduce the interest rate for September 2014 by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.25 percent, is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent ayear over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends ondevelopments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developmentsin the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitordevelopments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support forthe stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue tokeep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for September 2014 will be published on September 8, 2014. The decisionregarding the interest rate for October 2014 will be published at 16:00 onMonday. September 22, 2014. Inflation data: The Consumer PriceIndex (CPI) for July increased by 0.1 percent, slightly below forecasters' projections for an increase of 0.2 percent, on average. There were significant increases in the fruit and vegetables, housing, and transportand communication components, and marked declines in the clothing and footwear and furniture components. The inflation rate over the preceding 12 months was 0.3 percent, compared with 0.5 percent over the 12 months ended in June. The tradable goods components of the CPI declined by 1.3 percent overthe past 12 months. There was a further decline in the rate of increase incomponents consisting of nontradable products, and they increased by only 1.1 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts:This month, inflation expectations, from all sources and for all ranges, continued to decline. Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings: as well as inflation expectations for the coming year derived from the capital market (seasonally adjusted): declined to 1.1 percent, and two-year projections declined to 1.3 percent. (In the recent period there has been a difficulty in calculating 1-year expectations because there aren't CPI-indexed bond series for that range.) Expectations for the next 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates declined to 0.8 percent, below the lower bound of the inflation target range. Continuing an extended decline since the April CPI waspublished, inflation expectations for medium terms declined by about 0.2 percentage points, to 1.7 percent, and expectations for longer terms declined by about 0.1 percentage points, to 2 percent. According to most forecasters, as well as data from the makam and Telbor curves, the Bank of Israel interest rate is not expected to be reduced in the coming three months. Real economic activity: Data on real economic activity which became available this month indicate moderation in growth of activity even before Operation Protective Edge. Preliminary indicators for July signal further moderation due to the operation, part of which, primarily that related to tourism, is likely to last for a relativelylong time, while moderation related to private consumption is expected to be of a temporary nature, and consumption may compensate for that moderation over time. Based on the first estimate of second quarter National Accounts data. GDP growth slowed to only 1.7 percent (National Accounts data are in annual terms, seasonally adjusted), while growth of business sector product increased to 2.3 percent. The decline in growth is mainly the result of a contraction of 10.1 percent in exports (excluding diamonds and startups),led by goods exports, and by a contraction in investment (1.6 percent, excluding ships and aircraft), primarily in housing. Private consumption increased at a decent rate of 3.1 percent. The Composite State of the Economy Index was unchanged in July, after increasing moderately in previous months, and this deterioration partly reflects the effect of the security situation. Goods exports (excluding ships and aircraft and diamonds) increased by 1.1 percent in July, and their level is similar to the monthly average for the second quarter. Goods imports (excluding diamonds, ships and aircraft, and fuels) declined by 1.8 percent in July. In the first week of July, there was an impressive increase in tourist entries into Israel compared with thecorresponding period of the year before. However, with the beginning of the fighting, there was a sharp turnaround, and overall in July tourist entries were 26 percent lower than in July 2013. Various indicators of retail trade mostly point to a decline in the volume of trade during the fighting, primarily reflecting deferred purchases which are likely to be carried out afterward. As was the case in previous security events, consumer confidence indices apparently were not affected by the security situation: the Globes and the Bank Hapoalim indices increased in July. The Central Bureau of Statistics index continued to decline, but that began in earlier months. The Purchasing Managers Index declined to 46.8 points in July, and has been indicating contraction in manufacturing activity for two months now. The Business Tendency Survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics indicates a decline in business sector activity in July, and the Climate Index derived from thatsurvey declined, reflecting a monthly growth rate of 0.22 percent."
Hungary,2014-08-26,"At its meeting on 26 August 2014, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 2.10%. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening, output remains below potential and is only likely to approach that level in the course of next year. Despite the pick-up in the components of domestic demand, capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungary's export markets. With employment rising, the unemployment rate has been broadly flat since the start of the year, but still exceeds its long-term level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Based on the inflation data for July, consumer prices continue to show historically low dynamics. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation capturing the medium-term outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy, reflecting low inflation in external markets, the degree of unused capacity in the economy, subdued wage dynamics, the fall in inflation expectations and the reductions in administered prices, implemented in a series of steps. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact and low inflation is likely to persist for a sustained period. However, domestic demand-side disinflationary pressures are weakening gradually as activity gathers pace, and inflation is likely to reach levels around 3 per cent consistent with price stability by the end of the forecast horizon. Based on data available since the previous interest rate decision, economic growth continued, in line with the June projection, as reflected in data for industrial production and retail trade. In the Council's judgement, the Hungarian economy returned to a growth path in 2013. Looking ahead, economic growth may continue in a more balanced pattern than previously, with the recovery in domestic demand likely to make a greater contribution. The increasing use of EU funding and the easing in credit constraints also due to the Bank's Funding for Growth Scheme are expected to sustain the recovery in investment. Household consumption is also likely to grow gradually, mainly as a result of the expected increase in the real value of disposable income and the reduced need for deleveraging. However, propensity to save is expected to remain above levels seen prior to the crisis. Based on labour market data for June, the number of employees continued to rise and the unemployment rate was unchanged. International investor sentiment deteriorated somewhat in the past month, mainly reflecting the escalation of geopolitical conflicts and revised expectations of an interest rate increase by the US Federal Reserve. Hungarian risk premia remained broadly unchanged in the period and the forint exchange rate depreciated, mostly along with other currencies of the region. Hungary's persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. The Bank's self-financing programme may contribute to an improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy. In the Council's judgement, a cautious approach to policy is still warranted due to uncertainty about future developments in the global financial environment. In the Council's judgement, there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate in the medium term. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the monetary policy horizon. Looking ahead, therefore, the disinflationary impact of the real economy is likely to diminish and, with current monetary conditions maintained, inflation is likely to move into line with the target over the medium term. The Council judges that, based on available information the current level of the central bank base rate is consistent with the medium-term achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support for the economy. If the assumptions underlying the Bank's projection hold, achieving the medium-term inflation target points in the direction of maintaining current loose monetary conditions for an extended period."
Turkiye,2014-08-27,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been reduced from 12 percent to 11.25 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been reduced from 11.5 to 10,75, and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.5 percent. b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 8.25 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been reduced from 13.5 percent to 12.75 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. In line with these developments, private final domestic demand follows a modest course. The adverse impact of exchange rate developments since mid-2013 on annual inflation is gradually tapering off. However, elevated food prices continue to delay the improvement in the inflation outlook. In this respect, the Committee also evaluated the possible impact of the drought and the geopolitical risks on the inflation outlook. In light of these assessments the Committee decided to maintain the current stance within a more symmetric interest rate corridor. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Egypt,2014-09-01,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release September 1, 2014 In its meeting held on September 1, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 925 percent, 1025 percent, and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 975 percen. Headline CPI accelerated by 351 percent (m/m) in July compared to 084 percent (m/m) in June, while the annual rate jumped to register 1104 percent in July from 820 percent in Jun. In early July, the government launched its fiscal consolidation program, adjusting upwards the prices of several regulated prices including diesel, benzene, electricity and tobacc. The direct effect of these price adjustments explained the bulk of the monthly price development. Moreover increases in the prices of inland transportation, fresh vegetables & fruits and other food items can be partly attributed to the indirect effects of the regulated price adjustments as well as the seasonal effect of Ramada. In the meantime, core CPI increased by 179 percent (m/m) in July compared to 068 percent (m/m) in June, while the annual rate increased to 957 percent in July compared to 876 percent in June and was partially limited by a favorable base effect from the previous yea. While the direct first round effect of the price adjustments have led to a level shift up in the headline CPI in July 2014, higher than anticipated indirect and second round effects pose an upside risk to the inflation outloo. On the other hand, as the possibility of a sharp rebound in international food prices is unlikely in light of recent global developments, upside risks to the inflation outlook from imported inflation continue to be containe. Meanwhile real GDP picked up slightly in 2013/2014 Q3, growing by 250 percent compared to the 104 and 144 percent recorded in the previous two quarters, respectivel. This brought the annual growth for the first nine months of 2013/2014 to 165 percent compared to the growth rate of 231 percent during the corresponding period of 2012/201. The slight pickup in economic activity during 2013/2014 Q3 came on the back of the pickup in the growth rates in the two key sectors, namely manufacturing and construction, despite the contraction witnessed in the tourism and petroleum sector. In the meantime, investment levels continue to be low despite the relative improvement witnessed in the annual growth rate, which registered 250 percent after six quarters of contractio. Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects such as the Suez Canal are expected to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate to anchor inflation expectations and limit a generalized price increase given the lagged transmission of the previous rate hike across the economy and the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlook. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Sub Governor.

Poland,2014-09-03,"Warsaw, 3 September 2014 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 2-3 September 2014 The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 2.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 4.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis;  bill rediscount rate at 2.75% on an annual basis. Growth in global economic activity remains moderate, although the economic situation varies across countries. Following a contraction in GDP in early 2014, economic growth in the United States accelerated significantly in 2014 Q2. Moreover, economic indicators suggest that the recovery will continue in the coming quarters. At the same time, economic growth in the euro area came to a halt in quarterly terms, as GDP in Germany and Italy decreased and France remained in stagnation. Economic activity indicators for the euro area may be pointing to some improvement in economic activity in Q3, though a deterioration in industrial sentiment has been recorded of late. In the largest emerging market economies, economic activity growth remains weak relative to their previous performance. Prices of many agricultural and energy commodities has decreased in recent months. Along with moderate global economic growth, this contributes to low inflation in many countries. In Poland's immediate environment  including in the euro area and the countries in Central and Eastern Europe  inflation remains close to zero. Major central banks continue their expansionary monetary policy. While the Federal Reserve has been reducing the scale of quantitative easing, the European Central Bank intends to expand it. As a result, some central banks in the countries strongly linked with the euro area have recently reduced their interest rates. In Poland, incoming data point to a slowing momentum of economic growth. In 2014 Q2, economic growth was slightly lower than in previous quarter. A decline in GDP growth resulted from a decrease in contribution of net exports below zero and a decline in investment growth. At the same time, a slight acceleration in consumption growth and a significant increase in inventories were conducive to a higher GDP growth rate. According to data for July, the annual growth in industrial production and retail sales remained low, while construction and assembly output growth plunged. Also, some economic activity indicators have recently declined, which may point to a further slowdown in economic activity. As economic growth decelerated in the second quarter, the number of the employed in the economy continued to rise. At the same time, wage growth eased. According to data for July, growth in employment continued in the enterprise sector, while the wage growth stabilized. Expansion in lending to the corporate sector and households in recent months has stabilized at a moderate level. In July, the annual CPI inflation declined and was negative (-0.2%), remaining well below the NBP inflation target (2.5%). The decline in inflation was driven by decline of food prices and lower core inflation, which indicates a lack of demand pressure. Also, a decline in producer prices confirms no cost pressures. It is accompanied by very low inflation expectations of businesses and households. In the opinion of the Council, uncertainty about the outlook for economic activity in Poland has recently increased, which translates into higher uncertainty about the prospects of inflation returning to the target. The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged. If the incoming data confirm weakening of economic activity and an increase in risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term, the Council will start an adjustment of monetary policy."
Euroarea,2014-09-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Katainen. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided today to lower the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by 10 basis points to 0.05% and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 10 basis points to 0.30%. The rate on the deposit facility was lowered by 10 basis points to -0.20%. In addition, the Governing Council decided to start purchasing non-financial private sector assets. The Eurosystem will purchase a broad portfolio of simple and transparent asset-backed securities (ABSs) with underlying assets consisting of claims against the euro area non-financial private sector under an ABS purchase programme (ABSPP). This reflects the role of the ABS market in facilitating new credit flows to the economy and follows the intensification of preparatory work on this matter, as decided by the Governing Council in June. In parallel, the Eurosystem will also purchase a broad portfolio of euro-denominated covered bonds issued by MFIs domiciled in the euro area under a new covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3). Interventions under these programmes will start in October 2014. The detailed modalities of these programmes will be announced after the Governing Council meeting of 2 October 2014. The newly decided measures, together with the targeted longer-term refinancing operations which will be conducted in two weeks, will have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet. These decisions will add to the range of monetary policy measures taken over recent months. In particular, they will support our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates and reflect the fact that there are significant and increasing differences in the monetary policy cycle between major advanced economies. They will further enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and support the provision of credit to the broad economy. In our analysis, we took into account the overall subdued outlook for inflation, the weakening in the euro area's growth momentum over the recent past and the continued subdued monetary and credit dynamics. Today's decisions, together with the other measures in place, have been taken with a view to underpinning the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations, in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. As our measures work their way through to the economy they will contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to 2%. Should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation, the Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following four quarters of moderate expansion, euro area real GDP remained unchanged in the second quarter of this year compared with the previous quarter. While it partly reflected one-off factors, this outcome was weaker than expected. With regard to the third quarter, survey data available up to August indicate a loss in cyclical growth momentum, while remaining consistent with a modest expansion. Domestic demand should be supported by the range of our monetary policy measures, the ongoing improvements in financial conditions, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, and lower energy prices supporting real disposable income. Furthermore, demand for exports should benefit from the global recovery. At the same time, the recovery is likely to continue to be dampened by high unemployment, sizeable unutilised capacity, continued negative MFI loan growth to the private sector, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors. Looking ahead, the key factors and assumptions shaping the outlook for growth need to be monitored closely. These elements are reflected in the September 2014 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP increasing by 0.9% in 2014, 1.6% in 2015 and 1.9% in 2016. Compared with the June 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projections for real GDP growth for 2014 and 2015 have been revised downwards and the projection for 2016 has been revised upwards. The Governing Council sees the risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area on the downside. In particular, the loss in economic momentum may dampen private investment, and heightened geopolitical risks could have a further negative impact on business and consumer confidence. Another downside risk relates to insufficient structural reforms in euro area countries. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.3% in August 2014, after 0.4% in July. This decline reflects primarily lower energy price inflation, while the other main components remained broadly unchanged in aggregate. Inflation rates have now remained low for a considerable period of time. As said, today's decisions, together with the other measures in place, have been taken to underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations, in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. On the basis of current information, annual HICP inflation is expected to remain at low levels over the coming months, before increasing gradually during 2015 and 2016. The September 2014 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual HICP inflation at 0.6% in 2014, 1.1% in 2015 and 1.4% in 2016. In comparison with the June 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for inflation for 2014 has been revised downwards. The Governing Council, taking into account the measures decided today, will continue to closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. In this context, we will focus in particular on the possible repercussions of dampened growth dynamics, geopolitical developments, exchange rate developments and the pass-through of our monetary policy measures. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for July 2014 continue to point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (M3), with annual growth standing at 1.8% in July, compared with 1.6% in June. The growth of the narrow monetary aggregate M1 stood at 5.6% in July, up from 5.4% in June. The increase in the MFI net external asset position, reflecting in part the continued interest of international investors in euro area assets, remained an important factor supporting annual M3 growth. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained negative at -2.2% in July, unchanged compared with the previous month. Lending to non-financial corporations continues to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.5% in July, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. Against the background of weak credit growth, the ECB is finalising the comprehensive assessment of banks' balance sheets, which is of key importance to overcome credit supply constraints. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis led the Governing Council to decide on measures to provide further monetary policy accommodation and to support lending to the real economy. With regard to structural reforms, important steps have been taken in several Member States, while in others such measures still need to be legislated for and implemented. These efforts now clearly need to gain momentum to achieve higher sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. Determined structural reforms in product and labour markets as well as action to improve the business environment are warranted. As regards fiscal policies, comprehensive fiscal consolidation in recent years has contributed to reducing budgetary imbalances. Euro area countries should not unravel the progress made with fiscal consolidation and should proceed in line with the Stability and Growth Pact. The Pact acts as an anchor for confidence, and the existing flexibility within the rules allows the budgetary costs of major structural reforms to be addressed and demand to be supported. There is also leeway to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies. A full and consistent implementation of the euro area's existing fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance framework is key to bringing down high public debt ratios, to raising potential growth and to increasing the euro area's resilience to shocks."
Philippines,2014-09-10,"Statement by BSP Officer-in-Charge Diwa C Guinigundo. At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to increase the BSP's key policy rates by25 basis points to 4.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and6.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDA) were also raised accordingly. Meanwhile, the reserve requirement ratios were left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on the assessment that the inflation target, particularly for 2015, remains at risk. Latest baseline forecasts have shifted closer toward the higher end of the target range of 3±1 percent for 2015, indicating elevated inflation pressures. Moreover, inflation expectations are seen to be settling near the upper end of the inflation target range, particularly for 2015. At the same time, the balance of risks to the inflation outlook continues to lean toward the upside, with price pressures emanating from the possible further increases in food prices as a result of tight domestic supply conditions, as well as from pending petitions for adjustments in utility rates and potential power shortages. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board deemed it necessary to respond with stronger policy action to rein in inflation expectations further and preempt potential second-round effects even as previous monetary responses continue to work their way through the economy. The Monetary Board believes that the continued favorable prospects for domestic demand—as evidenced by the stronger GDP growth in the second quarter—allow some scope for a further adjustment in policy rates. Going forward, the BSP remains prepared to take appropriate policy actions as necessary to ensure the achievement of its price and financial stability objectives."
Chile,2014-09-11,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 11 September 2014 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 3.25% (annual). Internationally, incoming information confirms the outlook of recovery of the United States, and the weakening of Eurozone growth. Growth forecasts for emerging Asia remain stable, while in Latin America there is confirmed weakness in a significant part of the region. External financial conditions continue to be favorable. The prices of a majority of commodities have dropped, while copper's has remained fairly stable. Output, demand and employment indicators continue to reflect the low dynamism of the Chilean economy. Even so, the unemployment rate remains low and the annual growth rate of nominal wages has risen further. In August, headline inflation remained at 4.5% annually. Medium-term inflation expectations remain around 3%, despite an increase for the figure expected for the end of this year. The most likely scenario continues to assume that inflation will stay above the upper bound of the tolerance range still for some months, to later return to the target. This evolution will continue to be monitored with special attention. Domestic credit conditions continue to be favorable in general, partly reflecting the impact of the monetary stimulus. The Board will consider the convenience of introducing further monetary stimulus in line with the evolution of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions and its implications on the inflationary outlook. At the same time, the Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2014-09-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.25% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that, although the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, the economic recovery in the euro area has shown signs of slowing while trends of economic growth in emerging market countries have differed from country to country. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance, by the weakening of economic growth in the euro area and in some emerging market countries, and by geopolitical risks. In Korea, while exports have shown a favorable pattern the Committee judges that domestic demand, after having contracted due mainly to the impacts of the Sewol ferry accident, has improved somewhat, centering around consumption, but that the weak sentiment of economic agents has not clearly recovered. On the employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will gradually narrow going forward, although its pace of narrowing will be moderate. Consumer price inflation fell from 1.6% the month before to 1.4% in August, due mainly to increases in the extents of decline in the prices of agricultural and petroleum products. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices rose slightly to 2.4%, from 2.2% in July, due largely to increases in industrial product prices. The Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, but judges that for the time being inflationary pressures will not be high. In the housing market, the upward trends of both sales and leasehold deposit prices accelerated slightly in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while in the rest of the country their levels of increase seen in the previous month continued. In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have fluctuated considerably as the effects of the government's economic stimulus policies and of geopolitical risks have overlapped. The Korean won, after having appreciated in line for example with the continuation of the current account surplus, has depreciated under the influence of the US dollar's strength globally. Long-term market interest rates have meanwhile fluctuated within a narrow range. Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while supporting the recovery of economic growth. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as shifts in major countries' monetary policies, changes in economic agents' sentiment, and the future movements of economic indicators including the household debt trend, while observing the effects of last month's Base Rate cut and the government's economic policies."
Russia,2014-09-12,"On 12 September 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to maintain the Bank of Russia key rate at 8.0 percent per annum. In August — early September 2014 the year-on-year consumer prices growth rate increased again due to materialisation of inflation risks associated with aggravation of geopolitical tensions, the imposition of external trade restrictions and the impact of these developments on the ruble exchange rate dynamics. As a result, consumer price growth rate is likely to remain exceeding 7% till the end of 2014. In addition to this, the risks related to possible changes in tax and tariff policy persist. According to the Bank of Russia estimates current monetary policy stance will ensure decline in consumer price growth rate to the target of 4% in the medium run. The Bank of Russia will decide whether it is appropriate to change the key rateconsidering the risks for achieving medium-term inflation target taking into account economic development prospects. If inflation expectations remain at the elevated level and the threat of inflation exceeding the target in the medium-term emerge the Bank of Russia may continue raising the key rate. The year-on-year consumer price growth rate stood at an estimated 7.7% as of 8 September. Core inflation rose to 8.0% in August 2014. Higher price growth rates for non-food products excluding petrol amounted to 5.3%. At the same time prices growth for non-food items was observed in certain commodity groups of imported goods and was caused by more prolonged than supposed influence of ruble depreciation at the end of 2013 — in early 2014. Inflation acceleration was provoked, inter alia, by the imposition of external restrictions in early August and developed in spite of lower indexation of administered prices and utility tariffs and lower prices for fruit and vegetables due to the new harvest. Given these circumstances inflation expectations of households and firms increased. Current monetary conditions set the basis for inflation deceleration in the medium run. According to the estimates, the year-on-year the growth rate of money supply decreased from 17.1% on 1 September 2013 to 6.5% on 1 September 2014. Growth of interest rates on household deposits contributes to increase in propensity to save and increase attractiveness of deposits for cash holdings. Given interest rates growth and an increase of requirements to borrowers, lending sees further decrease. At the same time, the lending market adjustment to new market conditions and to the earlier decisions made by the Bank of Russia has not finished yet. Economic activity remains weak. Anaemic economic growth is mostly caused to a significant degree by structural reasons. Utilisation of productive factors — labour force and competitive productive capacities — is high. However, labour productivity growth is sluggish. Due to the long-term demographic trends labour supply decreases. External political uncertainty has an adverse impact on economic activity along with structural factors. Investment activity remains low amid low business confidence and limited access to long-term financing in both international and domestic markets. At the same time the rate of decrease in fixed capital investments is slowing down. Consumer activity sees gradual decline amid the slowdown in real wages growth and the saturation of consumer lending market. Economic slack in most countries that are Russia's trading partners restrains the economic growth in Russia. At the same time oil prices remains high even after resent decline, thus supporting the national economy. In the second half of 2014 further slowdown in economic growth is expected amid the imposition of sanctions against Russian companies and the remaining uncertainty. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, the year-on-year GDP growth rate is to decline to 0.2% in 2014 Q3 and amount to 0.4% as of the end of 2014. Should the external political situation normalize, economic uncertainty decrease and expectations of economic agents improve, investment activity will see gradual recovery. Consumer demand growth will stabilise at a lower level. Net export contribution to GDP growth will stand close to zero. According to the Bank of Russia estimates. GDP growth rate in 2015 will amount to 0.9-1.1%. Consumer price growth rate with high probability is likely to remain exceeding 7% till the end of 2014. Further inflation dynamics will be determined, inter alia, by the speed of adjustment of the economy to the imposed restrictions. The increase in consumer prices growth caused by the aforementioned factor is unlikely to be protracted. In the absence of negative shocks, decline in inflation and inflation expectations is expected to resume in the first half of 2015 as the impact of the mentioned restrictions on prices is exhausted. Subdued aggregate demand along with total output of goods and services remaining slightly below potential will also facilitate inflation reduction. Current monetary policy stance will ensure deceleration of inflation to the target of 4% in the medium term. The next meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors on the key rate is scheduled for 31 October 2014 The press-release on the Bank of Russia Board of Directors' decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Peru,2014-09-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2014 BCRP LOWERED THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE TO 3.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to lower the monetary policy reference rate to 3.50 percent. This level of the reference rate is compatible with a projected rate of inflation within the target range in 2014 and with inflation converging to 2.0 percent in 2015. This forecast takes into account that: current and advanced indicators of economic activity continue to show a weaker-than-expected pace of growth; inflation expectations remain anchored within the inflation target range; recent indicators show mixed signals of recovery in the world economy, and the supply factors that led inflation to increase are moderating. This decision does not imply a sequence of reference rate cuts. Inflation in August registered a negative rate of 0.09 percent, as a result of which inflation in the last 12 months fell from 3.33 percent in July to 2.69 percent in August, within the target range again. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a negative rate of 0.03 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation fell from 2.73 percent in July to 2.55 percent in August. Current and advanced indicators of activity continue to show a weaker economic cycle than the one expected, with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output due mainly to the lower dynamism observed in investment and exports. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, and will implement additional monetary easing measures if it is necessary. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to lower the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 2.30 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.30 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.30 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for October on its meeting of October 9, 2014."
United States,2014-09-17,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. On balance, labor market conditions improved somewhat further; however, the unemployment rate is little changed and a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources. Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year. The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in October, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $5 billion per month rather than $10 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $10 billion per month rather than $15 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will end its current program of asset purchases at its next meeting. However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

President Fisher believed that the continued strengthening of the real economy, improved outlook for labor utilization and for general price stability, and continued signs of financial market excess, will likely warrant an earlier reduction in monetary accommodation than is suggested by the Committee's stated forward guidance. President Plosser objected to the guidance indicating that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for ""a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends,"" because such language is time dependent and does not reflect the considerable economic progress that has been made toward the Committee's goals.

Malaysia,2014-09-18,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. The global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. In the advanced economies, while growth performance has been uneven, a number of key economies have continued to show broader signs of improvement. In Asia, growth is supported by the continued expansion in domestic demand and the improved external environment. In this environment, the international financial markets have remained relatively stable. For Malaysia, economic activity has been supported by the continued growth in domestic demand and exports. Going forward, domestic demand is expected to moderate but remain the key driver of growth. While private investment activity is projected to remain robust, private consumption is expected to moderate. Exports will continue to benefit from the recovery in the advanced economies and from regional demand, although its growth will be slower, partly reflecting the base effect in the second half of 2013. The prospects are for the Malaysian economy to remain on a steady growth path. Inflation has continued to stabilise as the effects of the price adjustments for utilities and energy have continued to diminish. Inflation is expected to remain relatively stable for the remainder of the year. Going into next year, inflation is projected to edge higher and is expected to be above its long-term average due to domestic cost factors. The absence of external price pressures and more moderate demand conditions are expected to mitigate the impact of these cost factors on the underlying inflation. The current stance of monetary policy remains supportive of growth. Moving forward, the MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. The MPC will also continue to assess risks of destabilising financial imbalances. Further adjustment to the degree of monetary accommodation may be taken depending on how new information will affect the assessment on the balance of risks. This is to ensure the sustainability of the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy. Bank Negara Malaysia 18 September 2014."
South Africa,2014-09-18,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 18 September 2014 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the domestic inflation forecast has improved slightly, but the inflation trajectory remains uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. At the same time the domestic economic growth outlook has deteriorated further, with declining growth in both consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital formation, as confidence remains low. The combination of stubborn inflation and a sluggish growth outlook continues to pose a difficult dilemma for monetary policy. The global environment has been characterised by increased financial market volatility, following heightened speculation relating to the timing and extent of US monetary policy normalisation. This impacted on emerging market currencies in general, and on the rand in particular. This was further illustrated after yesterday's FOMC meeting, which reaffirmed the gradual pace of US monetary. This was further illustrated after yesterday's FOMC meeting, which reaffirmed the gradual pace of US monetary policy normalisation, and its data dependent nature. However, despite increased political instability and significant risks in a number of regions, the international oil price has declined along with continued weakness in global food prices, contributing to a more benign global backdrop for the domestic inflation outlook. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas surprised on the upside at 6,4 per cent in August, having measured 6,6 per cent and 6,3 per cent in June and July 2014 respectively. The higher turnout was mainly due to higher-than-expected food prices, which had been anticipated to continue their recent downward trend. Downward pressure was exerted by petrol prices which increased by 5,8 per cent, down from 8,3 per cent in July. The categories of food, housing utilities and transport together accounted for 3,8 percentage points of the inflation outcome in August, unchanged from the previous month. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, increased to 5,8 per cent, from 5,7 per cent in July, driven mainly by the impact of the weaker exchange rate on some goods categories. Administered price inflation excluding petrol measured 6,5 per cent, up from the 6,4 per cent in July. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods, which reached a recent high of 8,8 per cent in April, measured 8,1 per cent and 8,0 per cent in June and July respectively, driven in part by lower agricultural product inflation. MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 2. MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 2 The Bank's forecast of headline inflation is slightly more favourable than that presented at the previous meeting, mainly a result of lower expected food and petrol price pressures. Whereas for some time inflation had been forecast to peak at an average of 6,6 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year, the peak now appears to have occurred in the second quarter, at an average of 6,5 per cent. Inflation is now expected to average 6,2 per cent in 2014, compared with 6,3 per cent previously, and 5,7 per cent in 2015, (5,9 per cent previously), and to return to within the target range in the first quarter of 2015 instead of the second quarter as previously forecast. The inflation forecast for 2016 increased to 5,8 per cent from 5,6 per cent, mainly as a result of the revised electricity price assumption following the review of Eskom tariffs by Nersa. The revised assumption makes provision for electricity price increases of 11,6 per cent from July 2015 and again from July 2016. The forecast for core inflation is unchanged at an average 5,6 per cent and 5,7 per cent in 2014 and 2015 respectively, reaching a peak of 5,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2015, and moderating to 5,5 per cent in 2016. As before, the MPC sees the risks to the headline inflation forecast to be skewed to the upside, with possible renewed pressure coming from the exchange rate. Inflation expectations, as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University in the third quarter of 2014, have again remained more or less unchanged, and anchored at around the upper end of the target range. Inflation is expected to average 6,2 per cent in 2014 and 6,1 per cent and 6,0 per cent in 2015 and 2016 respectively. As usual, there is a MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 3. As usual, there is a MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 3 fairly wide dispersion of expectations between the different categories of respondents. While business people expect inflation to average 6,4 per cent in 2015 and 2016, analysts' expectations average 5,7 per cent and 5,4 per cent. Expectations of trade unionists are for 6,2 per cent in both years, and all categories of respondents expect inflation in the current year to average 6,2 per cent. Household inflation expectations for 2014 remained unchanged at 6,3 per cent. The global growth recovery remains asynchronous amid sustained improvements in the US and UK, and deteriorating prospects in the Eurozone and Japan. Although growth in the US is not expected to exceed the 2,2 per cent achieved in 2013, this is mainly a result of the contraction during the first quarter of this year. Real output growth of 4,2 per cent was recorded in the second quarter of 2014, and consensus forecasts are for growth rates of around 3 per cent in the next two quarters. Similar growth rates are expected in 2015. At the same time the unemployment rate has been declining at a faster pace than previously anticipated. While the growth outlook for the UK remains positive, possible downside risks could emerge should Scotland vote for independence from the United Kingdom. Growth in the Eurozone has remained weak, with the German economy also under pressure following a contraction in the second quarter. Sanctions on Russia are expected to be an additional constraint affecting the Eurozone's growth outlook. Although the Japanese economy appears to be recovering from the VAT-induced slump in the second quarter, the recovery looks fragile. MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 4. MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 4 While emerging Asia appears to be benefiting most from the US recovery, emerging markets generally are facing increasing headwinds. Signals coming out of China continue to be mixed, amid a sharp slowdown in industrial production in August. Latin American economies also face a challenging outlook, particularly in Argentina. Venezuela and Brazil, which is currently experiencing a technical recession. Growth in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to remain relatively strong, although commodity producers may be adversely affected by lower commodity prices and possible spillover effects from the Ebola outbreak. There is a continued absence of significant upside global inflation risks, despite pressures experienced in some emerging markets. The various indicators of US inflation remain well contained below the 2 per cent level, while the fear of deflation in the Eurozone persists. Declining international oil and food prices, along with a number of other commodity prices, are expected to reinforce the current benign global inflation environment. The divergent growth outlooks in the advanced economies are likely to be the main drivers of monetary policy developments. The UK is expected to tighten monetary policy early next year. The stronger performance of the US labour market has led to heightened speculation that normalisation may begin earlier than previously anticipated. These expectations resulted in an appreciation of the US dollar against most currencies, as well as rising long-term US Treasury yields ahead of yesterday's FOMC meeting. At yesterday's press conference the FOMC Chair reaffirmed the view that policy normalisation will occur gradually, but is contingent on no surprises to employment growth or inflation in either direction. MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 5. MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 5 The data dependent nature of the forward guidance means that changes in the outlook for inflation, unemployment and growth are likely to lead to bouts of global financial market uncertainty in advance of FOMC meetings in the coming months. At the same time, however, the ECB has loosened monetary policy and has indicated its willingness to embark on some form of quantitative easing should this be necessary. Monetary policy is also expected to remain accommodative for some time in Japan. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, policy rates have been reduced in the Eurozone. Israel. South Korea. Chile and Hungary, and increased in Russia and New Zealand. Following a few weeks of relative stability, the rand exchange rate weakened in the past few days in response to US dollar strength, as well as the widening deficit on the current account of the balance of payments to 6,2 per cent of GDP. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand initially traded in a range of R10,50 and R10,75 against the US dollar, but has weakened since early September reaching a low of R11,07. On a trade-weighted basis, however, the rand depreciated by 0,4 per cent, having appreciated against the euro and the British pound. The rand is expected to remain sensitive to changes in sentiment regarding possible changes in US policy which will affect the appetite for emerging market assets generally, as well as to possible impacts from geopolitical risks and domestic factors. MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 6. MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 6 Since the previous MPC, non-residents have been net sellers of bonds to the value of R29,3 billion, but this has been offset in part by net purchases of equities to the value of R16,2 billion over the same period. Year to date there have been net outflows of bonds and equities to the value of R6,3 billion. These trends indicate that financing of the current account through portfolio inflows is likely to become increasingly challenging. The current account deficit in the second quarter of 2014 was wider than generally expected by the markets, following the 4,5 per cent of GDP recorded in the first quarter. This widening was a result of increased dividend outflows, lower dividend inflows following a large once-off inflow during the first quarter, and weak export growth, impacted to some extent by the platinum strike. Export growth in the third quarter is expected to remain constrained by the slow return to full capacity production by the platinum mines and the strike in the steel and engineering sector in July, which had significant spillover effects on the manufacturing sector in general. The current account is anticipated to narrow gradually over time. The domestic economic growth outlook remains weak following growth rates of -0,6 per cent and 0,6 per cent in the first and second quarters of the year respectively. These growth rates are well below potential output growth and indicative of a widening output gap. Partly as result of this outcome, as well as the expected impact of the metal workers strike in July, the Bank's forecast for GDP growth for 2014 has been revised down further to 1,5 per cent, from 1,7 per cent previously, with the risks still assessed to be on the downside. The forecasts MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 7. The forecasts MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 7 for both 2015 and 2016 have been revised down by 0,1 percentage points, to 2,8 per cent and 3,1 per cent respectively. The Bank's leading indicator of economic activity continues to trend sideways, consistent with a subdued growth outlook. Business confidence, as reflected in the RMB/BER business confidence index, remains negative despite a five index point increase to 46 in the third quarter. Adding to prevailing concerns are indications from Eskom that electricity supply constraints may be more severe and endure for longer than previously expected. The near-term outlook for mining remains subdued, with platinum production not expected to return to full capacity before the end of the year. In July, mining production recorded a broad-based year-on-year decline of 7,7 per cent, but a 0,9 per cent increase on a month-to-month basis. Manufacturing output declined significantly in July, recording year-on-year and month-to-month contractions of 7,9 per cent and 5,4 per cent respectively, largely due to the impact of the four- week strike in the steel and engineering sub-sector. Capacity utilisation in the sector declined from 82,1 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 to 80,6 per cent in the second quarter. More positively, the Kagiso PMI reflected some improvement in sentiment in August, with the index rising 3,1 index points to 49, marginally below the neutral level, while the construction sector has recorded growth rates of 5 per cent in the first two quarters of the year. Growth prospects have been constrained by the weakening trend in gross fixed capital formation which grew at an annualised rate of 0,5 per cent in the second quarter. Real fixed capital expenditure by both the public corporations and the private sector contracted during the quarter. Of particular concern is the MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 8. Of particular concern is the MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 8 continued downward trend over the past three quarters in private sector investment, despite higher capital outlays in the manufacturing sector. This has been reflected in the continued slow pace of employment creation in the private sector and the rise in the unemployment rate to 25,5 per cent in the second quarter of 2014. Consumption expenditure by households also continued its moderating trend which began in the first quarter of 2012, amid declining real disposable income growth. Annualised growth of 1,5 per cent was recorded in the second quarter of 2014. The slowdown was particularly marked in the durable and semi-durable goods categories, probably impacted by the prolonged strikes in the mining and manufacturing sectors. Retail trade sales contracted by 0,9 per cent in June on a month-to-month basis, but increased by 1,2 per cent in July, higher than generally expected. Wholesale trade sales contracted by 5,2 per cent month-to- month in July, and by 4,6 per cent year-on-year. Domestic vehicle sales have also slowed. Given the above, somewhat surprisingly the FNB/BER consumer confidence index increased from -6 to +4 in the second quarter. Trends in credit extension to households are consistent with the weak growth in household consumption expenditure, showing a further divergence between credit extension to households and to the corporate sector. Growth in total loans and advances over the year measured 9,7 per cent in July, with lending to the corporate sector increasing by 17 per cent, and to households by 4,1 per cent. The latter reflects continued sluggish growth in mortgage credit extension and MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 9. The latter reflects continued sluggish growth in mortgage credit extension and MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 9 tighter credit criteria for unsecured lending in particular. Twelve-month growth in general loans to households, which is mainly unsecured lending, reached a low of 0,2 per cent in July, while growth over three months exhibited an annualised contraction of 2,5 per cent. This decline is across all income groups, but more pronounced at the lower levels. A positive development is that household debt to disposable income moderated from 74,4 per cent in the first quarter to 73,5 per cent in the second quarter. Growth in corporate sector borrowing during the first half of the year was dominated by the agricultural sector, electricity supply (renewable energy projects) as well as wholesale and retail trade sectors. The cost of bank funding appears to have increased recently as a result of changed regulatory requirements relating to the implementation of Basel III, the impact of the bail-in of certain African Bank Limited creditors and the consequent rating action by Moody's Investor Service, all of which could result in tighter funding conditions. No new wage and unit labour cost data have been released since the previous meeting of the MPC, although settlements in the steel and engineering sector and the clothing sector have been well above current and expected inflation rates. The MPC remains concerned about the apparent delinking of wage demands and some wage settlements from underlying inflation and productivity growth trends, as well as the possible impact of forthcoming wage negotiations, including in the public sector. These concerns relate to settlements at all levels. MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 10. These concerns relate to settlements at all levels. MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 10 including executive pay. Excessive wage settlements could have adverse impacts on employment, inflation, the general competitiveness of the economy and the profitability and viability of small businesses in particular. Notwithstanding the 9,5 per cent increase in July, food price inflation is expected to slow over the coming months. Pipeline pressures from agricultural prices continue to moderate following sharply lower maize prices since March, while manufactured food price inflation declined to 8,5 per cent in July compared with 9,5 per cent in April. International food prices, as reflected in the FAO international food price index, declined for the fifth consecutive month in August in response to positive maize and wheat supply conditions. These developments are expected to impact favourably on domestic consumer prices, although base effects are likely to interrupt the declining year-on-year trend in the final months of the year. International oil prices declined in recent weeks, having traded in a range of between US$105-US$114 per barrel for the year to the end of July. Since August, the price has fallen below this range and is currently trading at around US$98 per barrel. This is despite rising tensions and instability in the Middle East and conflict in the Ukraine, events that in the past would likely have resulted in an oil price spike. As a result of this lower price, the domestic petrol price was reduced by 67 cents per litre in September, having been unchanged in August. At this stage there is an average over-recovery on the petrol price due to the lower MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 11. At this stage there is an average over-recovery on the petrol price due to the lower MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 11 international price, but the favourable impact is being partially offset by continued rand weakness. Despite the slight near-term improvement in the inflation outlook and the relatively stable inflation expectations, the MPC is concerned that the forecast remains uncomfortably close the upper end of the target band. Given the upside risks to the forecast, the proximity to the upper end of the band makes the inflation outcomes highly vulnerable to changes in inflationary pressures. A key upside risk is the exchange rate, which is vulnerable to the slow pace of adjustment to the current account deficit, as well as to the uncertainty surrounding the future path of monetary policy in the advanced economies. At this stage it is difficult to assess the extent to which normalisation of US monetary policy is already priced in to the rate. The MPC remains concerned about the risks of a wage-price spiral, should settlements well in excess of inflation and productivity growth become the economy-wide norm. Such developments could also undermine South Africa's international competitiveness and delay the current account adjustment. The deterioration in the longer term inflation trajectory relative to the previous forecast is a result of the revised tariff increases granted to Eskom by Nersa. The view of the Committee is that such relative price adjustments should not be reacted to automatically. However, while the focus of monetary policy should be MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 12. However, while the focus of monetary policy should be MPC Statement September 18th, 2014 Page 12 on the second round effects of these increases, this is complicated given the multi-year nature of the adjustment. While inflation is the primary focus of the Committee, the MPC is also mindful of the anaemic state of the domestic economy, rising unemployment and the downside risk to its growth forecast. Domestic expenditure has deteriorated further, particularly private sector fixed capital formation, and, together with continued moderation in household consumption expenditure, is indicative of the lack of demand pressures in the economy. The MPC is still of the view that interest rates will have to normalise over time. However, given the slightly improved inflation outlook notwithstanding the upside risks, the stable inflation expectations and the downside risks to the weak growth outlook, the MPC has decided that the repurchase rate will remain unchanged at 5,75 per cent per annum. Despite the 75 basis point increase so far this year, monetary policy remains accommodative, and will continue to be supportive of the domestic economy subject to achieving its primary inflation targeting objective. Future decisions will, as always, be highly data dependent. Gill Marcus GOVERNOR Contact person: Candice Jeffreys +27 12 313 4209 Candice.

Pakistan,2014-09-20,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Decision 20th September 2014 The post July monetary policy decision period continued to witness stable macroeconomic conditions. This was most visible in the headline variable of inflation that declined to. percent YoY in August 2014, which is its lowest level since June 2013. Moreover after recording an improved. percent growth rate in FY14, real economic activity is expected to continue in FY15. The other highlight of this stability is the gains on fiscal liberalization: shrinking budget deficits, contained government borrowings, and improved debt profile. Following on the actual number of. percent in FY14, the average CPI inflation during Jul-Aug 2014 is recorded at. percent. This declining trend is broad based since both measures of core inflation. Non-Food Non-Energy (NFNE) and trimmed mean, also decelerated YoY to. percent and.14 percent in August 2014 as compared to. percent and. percent in June 2014, respectively. Although actual low inflation might weigh positively on market sentiments, it is the future path of inflation that matters for monetary policy decision. The current outlook of around percent average CPI inflation for FY15 might change adversely if the subsidy to electricity is cut and Gas Infrastructure Development Cess is levied. After demonstrating low growth since 2008, real economic activity started to show signs of revival in FY14. Continuation of the current growth momentum, however, primarily hinges on agriculture production in FY15. This is because Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) growth might remain constrained due to continued energy shortages; reduced production capacity of independent power plants; low supply of gas to fertilizer plants; lower domestic and international prices in the sugar sector; and higher inventories and slower exports growth prospects in food and textile sectors, respectively. Incorporating the latest trends in exports and imports, oil payments in particular, trade deficit is going to dominate the composition of external current account deficit, even with healthy growth in workers' remittances. Declining private capital inflows, foreign direct investments in Page STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN particular, would present continued challenges in managing the balance-of-payments position. In this regard, realization of expected privatization receipts and issuance of dollar-denominated Eurobond/Sukuks would be important. In addition to the risks identified above, ongoing political impasse, delay in the finalization of fourth IMF review, and the current heavy rains and floods, which have engulfed central and southern Punjab, threaten the nascent recovery in economic activity. The former two would weigh more on the private capital inflows. The latter can potentially disrupt the output and supply chain of the perishable food items, which challenges an otherwise benign inflationary outlook. While it is going to take some time before the full extent of damages arrive, initial opinions and past experiences suggest that the current floods would damage some khariff crops and may disrupt supply chain temporarily. Besides having implications for economic growth, floods can also create macroeconomic imbalances by putting pressures on fiscal and external sector. Moreover supply of loanable funds in the credit to private sector market may also be adversely affected, at least initially. Reflecting these apprehensions indeed, there is deterioration in SBP-IBA's Consumer Confidence Survey of September 2014 as well. Policy vigilance requires balancing the tradeoffs between ensuring the continuation of macroeconomic stability, especially in the external sector, and assuaging the fallout of potential damages due to floods. Therefore the Board of Directors. State Bank of Pakistan, has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 10 percent. Page."
Israel,2014-09-22,"The inflation environment remained lowthis month. The inflation rate measured over the preceding 12 months was zero percent, and inflation expectations remain low, with some of them showing a further slight decline. The assessment that activity had already begun to moderate in the second quarter was bolstered this month. Partial data from the Companies Survey,as well as the Composite State of the Economy Index, tourist entries, and additional indicators point to the moderation continuing in the third quarter, most of which is attributed to the effects of Operation Protective Edge. Labor Force Survey data indicate that the improvement in the labor markethas halted, though health tax receipts point to continued expansion, at the rate of recent months. The shekel weakened by 1.6 percent this month in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Continued depreciation will support a recovery in exports and in the tradable sector. The shekel has depreciated by about 1.3 percent since the beginning of the year. The global economic situation is uneven: recoveries are becoming established in the US and the UK, but slowdowns continue in Europe and Japan, anddata in China were disappointing. World trade is growing at a slow rate. The Fed is still expected to increase the federal funds rate in the US in the second half of 2015, while in Europe and Japan, monetary easing is apparently being enhanced. Home prices increased by 6.8 percent in the previous 12 months, and theincrease in the balance of housing credit continues. The Supervisor of Banks published a draft directive which instructs banks to increase their Tier 1 capital buffers in accordance with the volume of housing credit. The number of transactions continues to decline, against the background of the uncertainty in the market, among other things regarding the plan for a zero VAT rate on new homes. Corporate bond funds are again showing net new investment, although at relatively low volumes. Spreads in that market continue to apparently indicate underpricing of risks. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for August declined by 0.1 percent, in contrast toforecasters' projections for an increase of 0.2 percent, on average. There were significant increases in the fruit and vegetables, housing, and culture and entertainment components, and marked declines in the clothing and footwear and the transport and communication components. The inflation rate over the preceding 12 months was zero percent, compared with 0.3 percent over the 12 months ended in July. The tradable goods components of theCPI declined by 2.0 percent over the past 12 months. In contrast, there was a slight rise in the rate of increase in components consisting of nontradable products, and they increased by 1.2 percent, compared with 1.1 percentin the previous month. In light of the interest rate reduction in the past two months, by a cumulative 0.5 percentage points, and the supportthat the low interest rate level is providing the economy at this time, the Monetary Committee decided to keep the interest rate unchanged this month. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitordevelopments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support forthe stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue tokeep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for October 2014 will be published on October 6, 2014. The decisionregarding the interest rate for November 2014 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. October 27, 2014. Inflation and interest rate forecasts:This month, 1-year inflation expectations (seasonally adjusted) derived from the capital market remained at 1.1 percent, near the lower bound of the inflation target range, and 2-year expectations declined slightly to 1.3 percent. Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings remained at 1.1 percent. Expectations for the coming 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates continued to decline, from 0.8 percent in the previous month to 0.7 percent this month. Expectations for medium and long terms continued to decline this month, by about 6 basis points on average, continuing the extended decline seen since the AprilCPI was published. After the reduction of the Bank of Israel interest ratelast month surprised the markets, an additional reduction in the interest rate in the coming months is not expected by forecasters, nor is it reflected in data from the makam and Telbor curves. Real economic activity: Data on real economic activity which became available this month bolstered the assessment that activity moderated in the second quarter, and monthly indicators point to further moderation in the third quarter, among other things against the background of Operation Protective Edge. In the second estimate of second quarter National Accounts data. GDP growth was revised downward, from 1.7 percent to 1.5 percent (annual terms, seasonally adjusted), primarily as a result of a contraction of 12.2 percent in goods exports (excluding diamonds and startups) compared with a contraction of 10.1 percent in the first estimate. The current account surplus contracted to $2.2 billion in the second quarter (compared $3.6 billion in the first quarter) primarily as a result of an increase in the goods account deficit, which was partly offset by an increase in the services account surplus. Preliminary data from the Companies Survey for the third quarter indicate that the net balance continued to decline, encompassing most industries. Goods exports declined in August by 7.5 percent (dollar terms, excluding ships and aircraft and diamonds), and a trend of decline is becoming apparent compared with the second quarter. Services exports were stable in the second quarter compared with the first quarter. In August, there was an increase of 1 percent in goods imports (excluding ships and aircraft, diamonds, and fuels), and stability can beseen in them in July-August compared with the second quarter. In July-August, there was a sharp decline of 35.5 percent in the numberof tourist entries relative to the second quarter (seasonally adjusted). The Composite State of the Economy Index remained unchanged in August, and was negatively impacted primarily by declines in indices of goods and services (including tourism) exports for August, and by declines in the indices of trade revenue and industrial production for July. In July, credit card purchases declined by 5.6 percent. This month as well, no decline was seen in the various consumer confidence indices, despite the fighting in the South. The Purchasing Managers Index continued to decline this month, to only 42.6 points. The Climate Index, based on the Business Tendency Survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics, was compiled at the height of Operation Protective Edge, and reflects a low rate of growth of 0.13 percent, after reflecting a range of 0.19 percent to 0.28 percent in recent months. The labor market: Labor Force Survey data for August indicate that among the principal working ages (25-64) there has been a slight increase in the participation rate (79.3 percent compared to 79.1 percent in July) and the employment rate remained unchanged (at 75.1 percent). Over the year to date, there has been stability in these indicators. The unemployment rate for those ages increased in August (to 5.2 percent, compared with 5.0 percent in July), and the overall unemployment rate increased by a similar rate, to 6.4 percent. There was no increase in the number of employee posts from the beginning of the year, but there was a slight decline in the number of employee posts in the business sector. As opposed to these, other indicators point to continued stability in the labor market: Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of total wage payments in the economy, were 4.8 percent higher in July-August, on a nominal basis, than in the corresponding period of the previous year. Nominal wages increased by 0.72 percent, and real wages increased by 0.66 percent, in the second quarter, compared with the first quarter (seasonally adjusted data). There has been no marked change in the number of unemployment benefit claims and in the job vacancy rate since the end of 2013.</div> Budget data: In January-August, the deficit in the government's domestic activity (excluding net credit) was about NIS 6.1 billion, which is about NIS 3.9 billion smaller than the deficit in the seasonal path consistent with meeting the deficit target for 2014. This is because since the beginning of the year, domestic expenditure (excluding credit) is about NIS 5.4 billion below the seasonal path. With that, over the remainder of the year an acceleration in expenditure is expected due to the addition that will be provided to the defense budget in respect of the costs of Operation Protective Edge, and for the costs of agreements that the government arranged with entities that encountered difficulties due to the fighting, or with entities that are implementingreforms. Domestic revenues from the beginning of the year are about NIS 1.5 billion lower than the seasonal path. Tax revenues in August increased byabout 14.6 percent in real terms, compared with August 2013, and include tax payments by businesses in the South: totaling about NIS 400 million: that were deferred from July due to Operation Protective Edge; net of the effect of the deferral of taxes from July, total tax revenues increased by 12.4 percent in real terms. The staff forecast: This month theResearch Department updated its macroeconomic forecast. The notice of the forecast is being published in parallel with thisrelease. According to the revised forecast, the inflation rate in the coming 4 quarters (until the third quarter of 2015) will be 1.0 percent; the Bank of Israel interest rate is expected, according to the staff forecast, toremain at 0.25 percent. GDP is expected to grow in 2014 by 2.3 percent (2.9 percent in the previous forecast), and in 2015 it is expected to grow by 3.0 percent (similar to the previous forecast). The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on August 24, 2014, through September 19, 2014, the shekel weakened by about 3.5 percent against the dollar and by 0.4 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel weakened by about 1.6 percent this month. For the year to date, the shekel, in terms of the effective exchange rate, has weakened by about 1.3 percent. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on August 24, 2014, through September 19, 2014, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by 5.5 percent, similar to the worldwide trend. Yields in the government bond market declined this month, among other reasons as a result of the Bank of Israel reducing the interest rate last month: yields on the unindexed-bond yield curve declined by up to 23 basis points, with further steepening of the curve; the yield on the 10-year unindexed bond declined by about 16 basis points to 2.47 percent. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and corresponding 10-year US Treasury securities reversed, so that the US yield is 10 basis points higher than Israel's. Makam yields declined by about 20 basis points along the entire curve, and the 1-year yield is 0.25 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread remained virtually unchanged at 88 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in August, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 21.8 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 8.0 percent. The credit markets: Total outstanding debt of the business sector declined by about NIS 0.7 billion (0.1 percent) in July, to NIS 772 billion, as a result of the net repayment of debt. The figure is virtually unchanged relative to the end of 2013. In July, the nonfinancial business sector issued about NIS 2.5 billion in bonds, compared with a monthly average of NIS 3.7 billion since the beginning of the year. Since the reduction of the interest rate in August, net new investment in corporate bond mutual funds resumed, although at a lower volume than during the first months of the year. Bond market spreads continued to decline this month, and their level remains low, to an extent that may indicate the underpricing of risk in this market. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 2.2 billion (0.5 percent) in July, to aboutNIS 422 billion. The increase derived from continued growth in housing debt, which increased by 0.8 percent. In August, new mortgages taken out totaled NIS 4.1 billion, compared to a monthly average of about NIS 4.4 billion since the beginning of the year. The Banking Supervision Department published a draft directive this month which instructs the banks to increase theirTier 1 capital buffers in accordance with the volume of housing credit at each bank. The interest rate on new mortgages taken out declined in August on the unindexed variable-rate track (by 0.22 percentage points, similar tothe decline in the Bank of Israel interest rate), and remained virtually unchanged on the CPI-indexed tracks. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.5 percent inAugust. In the 12 months ending in August, this component increased by 2.0 percent, compared with 2.2 percent for that figure in the previous month. Home prices, which are measured in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased by 0.3 percent inJune-July. Over the 12 months ending in July, home prices increased by 6.8 percent, compared with an increase of 7.7 percent in the 12 monthsended in June. The number of new homes built by private initiative and that remain for sale increased by 2.1 percent in July compared with the previous month (seasonally adjusted data). In the first half of 2014, there was a 10.8 percent decline in building starts compared to the corresponding halflast year. After the number of transactions declined in the second quarter, preliminary indicators point to a continued decline in July. The global economy: An uneven picture is beginning to emerge in the global economy. In the US and the UK, therecovery is becoming established and a path of reduced monetary accommodation is beginning to become apparent, while in China. Europe. Japan and someemerging economies, it appears that accommodation will continue. World trade is growing at a slow annual rate of about 3 percent. In the US, second quarter GDP growth data was revised upward, and various indicators (the trade balance, factory orders, retail sales, and the Purchasing Managers and Consumer Confidence Indices) point to a continuing positive trend in the third quarter as well. Employment data were disappointing this month, as 142,000 jobs were added, compared to expectations of 230,000. The real estate market remains relatively weak in view of the moderation in the rate of price increases and a decline in new home sales. The Federal Reserve repeated itscommitment to leave the federal funds target rate at low levels for an extended period of time, and the expected date of the beginning of interest rate increases remains the second half of 2015, although the expected interest rate path for 2015 and 2016 was revised upward. In Europe, weak macro figures were published this month: purchasing managers indices and consumer confidence indices continue to indicate pessimism, while industrial production increased by 1 percent, more than expected. Inflation over the preceding 12 months is 0.3 percent, and facing the loss of momentum and the concern of deflation, the ECB reduced its interest rate by an additional 10 basis points this month, and announced the start of a quantitative easing program. The president of the ECB noted that monetary policy alone cannot stop the continued slowdown. In Japan, second quarter growth data were revised downward, to negative growth of 7.1 percent and, together withother data, they indicate that the slowdown does not derive just from the increase in VAT. The governor of the central bank said that the weakening of the yen will help the economy, and his words were interpreted as notice that further monetary accommodation is likely in 2015. In the UK, macro datawere positive, and the concerns of a negative impact to stability receded in view of the results of the referendum in Scotland. InChina there were disappointing macro data this month, and the central bankis adopting monetary easing measures totaling about 500 billion yuan in order to maintain the growth rate. In India there is a recovery, while the slowdown in Brazil is worsening and is accompanied by a further rating decline. The decline in commodity prices continues and, in turn, is affecting global inflation. The price of Brent Seacrude oil declined by 5.5 percent this month, and the commodities index excluding energy declined by 6.3 percent. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for October 2014 unchanged at 0.25 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the nexttwelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerationsunderlying the decision: The inflation environment remained lowthis month. Budget data: In January-August, the deficit in the government's domestic activity (excluding net credit) was about NIS 6.1 billion, which is about NIS 3.9 billion smaller than the deficit in the seasonal path consistent with meeting the deficit target for 2014.

Armenia,2014-09-23,"PRESS RELEASE 23.09.2014 At September 23, 2014 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, 6.75%. Inflation in August 2014 was 0.7% compared to 0.3% recorded for the same month last year, while the 12-month inflation has increased to some extent, making up 0.8% in late August. The Board believes that the inflationary environment will continue expanding, and in the first half of 2015 it is expected to stabilize around its target. External demand is recovering at a slower pace, whereas certain deflationary pressures especially on the part of energy and wheat are observable in commodity markets in line with increasing supply factors. Nevertheless, the Board concludes that significant uncertainties over economic prospects of partner countries and commodity markets are still persisting under geopolitical developments in the external sector. There was some increase in economic activity in the third quarter of 2014, yet economic growth remains sluggish. Despite low demand in external and domestic economies, the Board agrees that continued loosening of conditions of monetary policy so far implemented by the Central Bank is enough to lead to expanded aggregate demand and rebounded inflation rates in the short run, in expectation of expansionary fiscal policy in the second half of 2014 and introduction of stamp duty on a range of products starting from the fourth quarter. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2014 and in the first quarter of 2015, the 12-month inflation rate will gradually increase, approaching the target and keeping around it up until the end of the forecast horizon. In the medium term, in line with external and domestic economic developments, the Central Bank will adjust the directions of monetary policy, while further attaining the inflation target. Detailed information based on the setting of interest rate will be available in press release due on October 3rd, 2014 (Interest rate minutes). Press Service of the Central Bank."
Czech Republic,2014-09-25,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is based on the message of the current forecast and on an assessment of newly available information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. The forecast expects that the exchange rate will continue to be used as a monetary policy instrument until 2015 Q3. According to the forecast, the return to conventional monetary policy will not imply appreciation of the exchange rate to the level recorded before the CNB started intervening, because the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to the price level and other nominal variables. The new information indicates a slightly anti-inflationary balance of risks to the current forecast. In this situation, the Bank Board repeated that the Czech National Bank would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2016. As expected, annual headline inflation accelerated in Q3, reaching 0.6% in August. This figure was slightly higher than forecasted. This was due to a stronger recovery in food price inflation and a smaller decline in administered prices, owing chiefly to prices of natural gas for households. The weakened exchange rate continues to affect inflation in line with the Czech National Bank's assumptions. Adjusted for the weakened koruna, inflation would be negative. Core inflation, also called adjusted inflation excluding fuels, continued to edge up, reaching 0.9% in August in line with the forecast. According to the forecast, headline inflation can be expected to accelerate further in the period ahead and return to the 2% inflation target in the second half of next year. As expected, annual growth in economic activity slowed slightly in 2014 Q2. Real GDP rose by 2.7% compared to the same period a year earlier. This figure is negligibly  just 0.1 percentage point  lower than forecasted. In line with expectations, all components of demand except net exports contributed to the year-on-year increase in GDP. Exports continued to rise at a strong pace exceeding external demand growth, significantly aided by the weakened koruna. At the same time, however, imports rose even more strongly owing to a continued recovery in domestic demand driven by both consumption and investment. In quarter-on-quarter terms the output of the economy was unchanged. New information on developments abroad obtained from market outlooks and the September Consensus Forecasts survey shifts the outlook for consumer prices and foreign economic growth slightly lower this year and the next, but leads to no change in 2016. The producer price outlook has also been revised significantly downwards for this year, but there are no major changes for the following two years. This means the Czech economy faces stronger anti-inflationary pressures from the euro area this year than assumed by the current CNB forecast. The market outlook for foreign interest rates is unchanged for this year but has shifted slightly downwards for the following two years in response to a further monetary policy easing by the European Central Bank this month. The market outlook for oil prices is falling over the entire forecast horizon. However, as regards oil prices in euro terms and, in turn, koruna terms, the impact of lower dollar prices of oil is partly offset by a stronger outlook for the exchange rate of the dollar against the euro over the entire forecast horizon. As expected, annual wage growth in the business sector slowed in Q2 as the effect of wage optimisation in late 2013 and early 2013 faded out. However, wage growth was still higher than forecasted, implying the possibility of a faster labour market response to the switch to the growth phase of the business cycle, supported among other things by the weakening of the koruna. A positive turnaround on the labour market is also indicated by a rising number of vacancies, which is the highest in more than five years in seasonally adjusted terms. Average hours worked also started increasing as expected. At the same time, the seasonally adjusted general unemployment rate and the number of registered unemployed persons are continuing to fall at a steady, albeit gradual, pace broadly in line with expectations. Indicators from the real economy at the start of 2014 Q3 point to continued robust annual growth in industrial production supported by double-digit growth in orders from abroad and the domestic economy. Retail sales are also increasing noticeably in both the automotive segment and the sale of other non-food products. The fall in construction output in July, representing a departure from the solid data observed in previous months, can be attributed to a high comparison base in July 2013 due to intensive reconstruction work after floods. Overall, these indicators suggest that the rise in consumption and investment seen in the last two or three quarters is of a longer-lasting nature. Relatively rapid economic growth can therefore be expected to continue in line with the forecast. Producer prices are still recovering gradually, influenced by the weakening of the koruna. Prices in manufacturing returned to slightly positive year-on-year figures back in December 2013 and their growth has been accelerating slowly since then. The year-on-year decline in prices in industry as a whole, influenced by a marked drop in energy prices, has gradually unwound and industrial prices were unchanged year on year in August. Prices of construction work returned to modest growth in April and prices of market services did the same in May. The year-on-year decline in agricultural producer prices moderated, but the forecast had expected a slight annual increase. This downward deviation from the forecast is due partly to a fall in prices of some key agricultural commodities on global markets. To sum up the important facts from the Czech economy, annual GDP growth was slightly below the forecast in 2014 Q2. By contrast, inflation went up rather more than forecasted in July and August. The average wage rose considerably faster than expected in Q2. The seasonally adjusted share of unemployed persons was slightly higher than forecasted."
Turkiye,2014-09-25,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 11.25 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.5 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 8.25 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.75 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Exports remain supportive of balanced growth in spite of weakening global demand. Macroprudential measures taken at the beginning of the year and the tight monetary policy stance started to have favorable impact on the core inflation trend. Elevated food prices continue to delay the improvement in the inflation outlook. Meanwhile, declining commodity prices are expected to limit upside risks on inflation. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
India,2014-09-30,"Fourth Bi-Monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2014-15 By Dr.Raghuram G Rajan. Governor Part A: Monetary Policy Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.0 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL); reduce the liquidity provided under the export credit refinance (ECR) facility from 32 per cent of eligible export credit outstanding to 15 per cent with effect from October 10, 2014; continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 7-day and 14-day term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily one-day term repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 9.0 per cent. Assessment 2. Since the third bi-monthly monetary policy statement of August 2014, global activity has been recovering slowly from the setback in Q1 of 2014, on the back of strengthening consumer spending and gradually improving labour market conditions in advanced economies (AEs) like the United States. However, the Euro area, where growth has stalled in the core economies, continues to be weak. Major emerging market economies (EMEs) continue to struggle with tepid domestic demand and headwinds from structural impediments. With monetary policy in AEs remaining highly accommodative, investor risk appetite has increased and spread to various asset classes. With volatility perhaps excessively low, financial markets have risen to new highs, driving surges of capital flows to EMEs. Apart from concerns about a sudden correction in financial markets if investors misread the timing of a reversal of2 the US monetary policy stance or if geopolitical tensions intensify, some downside risks to growth also persist, such as a possible further slowdown in the Euro area. Domestic activity appears to have come off somewhat after the stronger-than- expected upturn in Q1 of 2014-15. In Q2, the growth of industrial production slumped in July, as capital goods production followed consumer durables into contraction. Exports cushioned the fall in manufacturing output, with the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey indicating expansion in export orders. Rainfall from the south west monsoon, now expected to be about 12 per cent deficient, will weigh on the kharif crop, mainly due to its uneven spatial distribution. This has resulted in drought-like conditions in some major production zones in the north-west region but also floods in the northern and eastern regions. In the services sector, constituents are moving at varying speeds and the purchasing managers' index points to uncertainty around future prospects. The recent cautious optimism that is building in the economy on the back of improved business sentiment needs to be placed on solid foundations through a step-up in investment. In this context, the resumption of stalled projects should provide a boost to inventory and capex cycles, while reducing distressed bank loans and revitalising growth. Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) came off the vegetable prices-driven spike in July 2014 and eased in all major groups barring food. Large and persistent upside pressures on food prices have resulted in their contribution rising to almost 60 per cent of headline inflation in August. The full impact of the skewed rainfall distribution carries risks to the future path of food inflation, though vegetable prices have fallen recently after the recent spike. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel decelerated to its lowest level in the new series, mainly on account of sharp disinflation in transport and communication and household requisites. Future food prices and the timing and magnitude of held back administered price revisions impart some uncertainty to an otherwise improving inflation outlook, where lower oil prices, a relatively stable currency, and a negative output gap continue to put downward pressure. Base effects will also temper inflation in the next few months only to reverse towards the end of the year. The Reserve Bank will look through base effects. Liquidity conditions have remained broadly balanced through Q2 of 2014-15, except for transient tightness in the second half of July and early August due to delayed Government expenditure. Thereafter, as these expenditures began to flow, liquidity conditions eased. With credit growth falling well below deposit growth in August and September, structural sources of liquidity pressures also eased. The average recourse to liquidity from the Reserve Bank, measured by daily net liquidity injection through LAF, term repo and MSF, decreased from 870 billion in July to 795 billion during August and further to 450 billion during September so far (up to September 28). The Reserve Bank revised its liquidity management framework with effect from September 5, 2014, with more frequent 14-day term repos and daily overnight variable rate repo operations, to ensure flexibility, transparency and predictability in liquidity management operations. Non-food credit growth decelerated in September 2014, the lowest level since June 2001, despite liquidity conditions remaining comfortable and deposit growth remaining normal. Partly, this sharp deceleration is on account of a high base  monetary tightening to curb the exchange market pressures in July-September last year raised interest rates on alternative sources of funds and pushed up the demand for credit from the banking system. Adjusting for these base effects, non-food credit growth would have been around 11 per cent in September 2014. Corporates have3 also opted to raise financing through alternative sources such as commercial paper, which are significantly larger than a year ago. Finance from other non-bank sources such as foreign direct investment and external commercial borrowing has also increased. Also, a few banks have sold stressed loans to asset reconstruction companies, and so these loans no longer appear as bank credit. Net bank credit is also lower because of repayments of loans by entities that have received payments by government departments and public enterprises, and because oil marketing companies' borrowing is lower. Finally, the slowdown in credit growth is more pronounced in public sector banks, but how much of this is because of needed bank balance sheet restructuring, repayments of stressed loans, or increased risk aversion is to be established. Going forward, as the investment cycle gathers momentum and overall demand picks up, banks will need to prepare to meet financing requirements as the credit cycle also turns. Equally, given the easy availability of foreign finance, corporations should be wary of being lulled by relative exchange rate stability and neglect to hedge foreign exchange liabilities. Incoming data suggest that the current account deficit, placed at 1.7 per cent of GDP for Q1 of 2014-15 may remain contained in Q2. Over April-August 2014, the trade deficit was narrower than a year ago, notwithstanding a slowdown in export growth in July and August and a strengthening of non-oil non-gold import growth to its highest level since March 2013. The improvement in the trade balance has benefited from the fall in the value of gold imports. Even as the external financing requirement stays moderate, all categories of capital flows remain buoyant. As a result, there has been an accretion to international reserves, even though reserves denominated in US dollars have moderated somewhat in recent weeks, largely because of the strength of the US dollar. Policy Stance and Rationale 8. Since June, headline inflation has ebbed to levels which are consistent with the desired near-term glide path of disinflation -- 8 per cent by January 2015. The most heartening feature has been the steady decline in inflation excluding food and fuel, by a cumulative 111 basis points since January 2014, to a new low. With international crude prices softening and relative stability in the foreign exchange market, some upside risks to inflation are receding. Yet, there are risks from food price shocks as the full effects of the monsoon's passage unfold, and from geo- political developments that could materialise rapidly. For the near-term objective, therefore, the risks around the baseline path of inflation are broadly balanced, though with a slant to the downside (Chart 1). However, the undershooting of the objective may be temporary because of base effects. Turning to the medium-term objective (6 per cent by January 2016) the balance of risks is still to the upside, though somewhat lower than in the last policy statement. This continues to warrant policy preparedness to contain pressures if the risks materialise. Therefore, the future policy stance will be influenced by the Reserve Bank's projections of inflation relative to the medium term objective (6 per cent by January 2016), while being contingent on incoming data.4 10. The momentum of activity in all sectors of the economy is yet to stabilize. Agriculture should shed the effects of recent shocks and pick up in Q4 of 2014-15. Industrial activity will await improvement in the business environment and the resumption of consumption and investment demand before gaining sustained speed. Post-monsoon revival in construction activity and the likely strengthening of momentum in business and financial services should sustain the recent signs of expansion in the services sector. The key to a turnaround in the growth path of the economy in the second half of the year is a revival in investment activity  in greenfield as well as brownfield stalled projects  supported by fiscal consolidation, stronger export performance and sustained disinflation. With expectations of these conditions remaining broadly unchanged, the projection of growth for 2014-15 is retained at 5.5 per cent within a range of 5 to 6 per cent around this central estimate. The quarterly growth path may slow mildly in Q2 and Q3 before recovering in Q4. With liquidity conditions easing, the recourse to ECR has fallen off substantially to about 10 per cent of the outstanding export credit eligible for refinance. Accordingly, in pursuance of the Dr.Urjit R. Patel Committee's recommendation to move away from sector-specific refinance, the access to the5 ECR is being brought down to 15 per cent of the eligible export credit, thus continuing to give banks room for manoeuvre. This will be in effect from October 10, 2014. The fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement is scheduled on Tuesday. December 2, 2014. Part B: Developmental and Regulatory Policies 13. This part of the Statement reviews the progress on various developmental and regulatory policy measures announced by the Reserve Bank in recent policy statements and also sets out new measures. Developmental and regulatory measures are being put in place within the organising framework of the five-pillar approach announced in October 2013 in the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2013-14. This approach emphasises the strengthening of the monetary policy framework; fortifying the banking structure; broadening and deepening financial markets; expanding access to finance; and dealing with stress in corporate and financial assets and putting them back to work. Monetary Policy Framework 15. Efforts to improve the monetary policy framework are documented in Part A of this Statement and in the accompanying Monetary Policy Report. In continuation of the process of implementing recommendations of the Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework (Chairman: Dr.Urjit R Patel), the first issue of the Reserve Bank's Monetary Policy Report is being placed in the public domain along with this Statement. Steps have also been taken to refine the liquidity management framework with a view to making it flexible, transparent and predictable. Banking and Financial Structure 16. The approach to strengthening the financial structure has been multi-pronged, comprising: an expansion of participation and competition in the financial system; building counter-cyclical capital and liquidity buffers compliant with Basel III standards; and refining and enhancing the efficacy of the regulatory and supervisory framework. Turning to expanding the banking space, draft guidelines on Small Banks and Payments Banks as differentiated or restricted banks were placed on the Reserve Bank's website on July 17, 2014. Based on the feedback received: final guidelines on licensing of these banks will be issued by end- November 2014.6 18. With regard to non-banking financial companies(NBFCs): changes in the regulatory framework for NBFCs will be introduced by end- October 2014 covering prudential regulations on core capital, asset classification and provisioning norms, regulation on deposit acceptance, corporate governance and consumer protection measures. With these changes coming into force, the Reserve Bank will recommence registering new NBFCs. Pursuant to the guidelines issued on the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) in June 2014 which permitted banks to reckon government securities to the extent allowed by the Reserve Bank under its marginal standing facility as Level 1 High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the LCR, banks will be allowed to: include government securities held by them up to another 5 per cent of their NDTL within the mandatory SLR requirement as level 1 HQLA in order to facilitate their meeting the LCR requirement while retaining the prudential aspect of the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR). This additional liquidity up to 5 per cent of NDTL will be available, in addition to the MSF, through a special facility and at a rate higher than the MSF rate as decided by the Reserve Bank taking into account the market conditions; and such government securities reckoned for the LCR should be valued at an amount no greater than their current market value as HQLAs are required to be taken at their market value for the purpose of computing the LCR. Detailed guidelines will be issued by mid-November 2014. To carry forward regulatory and supervisory initiatives, final guidelines for monitoring tools for intra-day liquidity management will be issued in October 2014, consistent with the quantitative tools finalised by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS); revised guidelines on a leverage ratio (LR) framework and attendant disclosure requirements, drawing on the BCBS's January 2014 paper, will also be issued by end-October 2014 so as to enable public disclosure of the LR by January 1, 2015; and a discussion paper will be issued by end-November on large exposures and convergence of exposure limits applicable in India with those of the BCBS which come into effect from January 1, 2019. An Early Warning System (EWS) is being put in place to track banks' critical financial parameters. Deviations from pre-defined benchmarks would trigger more granular oversight in the form of enhanced off-site monitoring, focused discussions, on-site examination and punitive action, if warranted. Along with early detection mechanisms for frauds, a Central Fraud Registry is also proposed to be created simultaneously as a searchable centralised database for use by banks. Guidelines for declaring borrowers as “non-co-operative” will be put out by end-October 2014.7 III. Financial Markets 24. As part of the Reserve Bank's continuous engagement in broadening and deepening financial markets, it has been decided to: allow access to the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) to scheduled urban co-operative banks (UCBs) in order to provide them an additional avenue for liquidity management, provided they fully comply with the eligible criteria prescribed for participation in the LAF including having current accounts and SGL accounts with Reserve Bank. Mumbai, the minimum bid size prescription and the like. Detailed guidelines will be issued separately by mid-October 2014. In order to further develop the government securities market and enhance liquidity, it has been decided to: bring down the ceiling on SLR securities under the HTM category from 24 per cent of NDTL to 22 per cent in a graduated manner i.e. 23.5 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning January 10, 2015, 23.0 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning April 4, 2015, 22.5 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning July 11, 2015 and 22.0 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning September 19, 2015. liberalise guidelines on short sale in Government securities as under: a. limit on short sale for liquid securities will be increased to 0.75 per cent of outstanding stock or 600 crore, whichever is lower (from 0.50 per cent of outstanding stock); short sale limit for illiquid securities is being retained at 0.25 per cent of the outstanding stock of securities; and b. banks and primary dealers (PDs) may be permitted to take short positions in government securities in the over-the-counter (OTC) market (within the total short sale limit), subject to appropriate audit/ internal controls. Detailed guidelines are being issued separately. In April 2014, the Reserve Bank announced that it would examine the possibility of allowing limited re-repo/re-hypothecation of repoed government securities with the objective of developing the term repo/money market. In view of the growth of repo markets during the last decade and the availability of a robust trading, clearing and settlement infrastructure with a central counter-party (CCP) guarantee, it has been decided to: permit re-repo of Government securities subject to appropriate control measures and development of IT infrastructure. Detailed guidelines will be issued in consultation with all stakeholders by end- January 2015. In order to address operational issues faced by foreign portfolio investors and long term foreign investors, it has been decided to: provide extended reporting timings on trade date and an option for T+2 settlements for secondary market OTC trades in government securities for such investors.8 Detailed guidelines in this regard would be issued by end-November 2014. With a view to easing operational conditions for hedging of foreign exchange risk by market participants, it has been decided to: increase the eligible limit for importers under the past performance route to 100 per cent from the existing 50 per cent i.e., importers can hedge up to 100 per cent of the average of past three years' import turnover or the preceding year's import turnover, whichever is higher, subject to compliance with other conditions applicable for hedging under this route. Access to Finance 29. Expanding access of finance to the small, the poor, the unorganised and the underserved sections of society has been a central tenet of the Reserve Bank's developmental policies. State-Level Coordination Committees (SLCCs) are being strengthened to focus on financial inclusion for flow of public savings to the formal channels and protection of public deposits mopped up by unauthorised and unscrupulous entities. In line with the recommendation of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC): the SLCC, which is now chaired by State chief secretaries/ UT Administrators, will meet every quarter instead of half-yearly. With a view to easing difficulties faced by common persons while opening bank accounts and during periodic updating, guidelines on ‘know your customer' (KYC) will be further simplified with immediate effect so that banks: do not insist on physical presence of the customer at the time of periodic updating; do not seek fresh proof of identity and address at the time of periodic updating in case of no change in status for 'low risk' customers; allow self-certification; accept a certified copy of the document by mail/post, etc; and do not seek fresh documents if an existing KYC compliant customer of a bank desires to open another account in the bank. There is a need for banks to complete KYC for all customers including long standing ‘low risk' customers. Banks should complete documentation, while minimising the effort on the part of the customer to what is strictly needed. In the event that customers are unable to comply within a reasonable time period, ‘partial freezing' may be introduced in respect of KYC non-compliant customers i.e., credits would be allowed in such accounts while debits would not be allowed, with an option to the account holder to close the account and take back the money in the account. In line with its vision of migrating towards electronic payments and a ‘less- cash' society, the Reserve Bank has been examining the feasibility of (a) standardisation in the operational processes and procedures involved in extension of mobile banking services, and (b) implementation of a pan-India bill payment system (recommended by GIRO Advisory Group (GAG)) facilitating anytime/anywhere payment of a variety of bills and dues. Similarly, the setting up and operationalisation of a system for uploading, accepting, discounting and settlement of the invoices/bills9 of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) is also being envisaged to facilitate faster financing for such entities. In this connection, it has been decided to: issue policy guidelines for the Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS). Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) and standardisation of processes in mobile banking services by end-November 2014. Customer protection is an integral element of the endeavour to expand access to finance. Accordingly, a draft Charter of Customer Rights under Consumer Protection regulations was placed on the Reserve Bank's website in August for comments from the public. For operationalising the Charter of Customer Rights: necessary instructions will be issued to the banks by the appropriate regulatory departments in the Reserve Bank shortly. Criteria for inviting applications from entities eligible under the Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEA-Fund) for registration will be issued on the Reserve Bank's website by the end of October 2014. Looking ahead, the Reserve Bank's developmental and regulatory policies will continue to evolve within the five-pillar approach to build a competitive, vibrant and sound financial system that is geared to intermediating the financing needs of a growing economy. Efforts will be made to harness appropriate technology and ensure that financial services are available to all even as customer awareness and protection is reinforced. The Reserve Bank will continue to carry forward banking sector reforms by adapting the best international practices to country-specific requirements.

Romania,2014-09-30,"In its meeting of 30 September 2014, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. With a view to mitigating interbank money market rate volatility, the NBR Board decided to narrow the symmetrical corridor of interest rates on NBR's standing facilities around the policy rate to ±2.75 percentage points from ±3 percentage points. Thus, starting 1 October 2014, the interest rate on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard) will be lowered to an annual 5.75 percent from 6.25 percent, while its deposit facility rate will remain at 0.25 percent per annum. The NBR reiterates its commitment to the adequate use of all its available instruments, on the background of close monitoring of domestic and global economic developments, with the aim of securing the achievement of its overriding objectives of medium-term price stability and the preservation of financial stability. The analysis of the latest macroeconomic data shows the annual inflation rate staying at low levels, on a path lower than previously forecasted, mainly under the impact of developments in agri-food prices and of the subdued euro area inflation, overlapping the persistence of the negative output gap and the downward adjustment in inflation expectations. The consolidation over the medium term of the projected inflation path at readings significantly lower than those forecasted previously is still uncertain. The annual inflation rate stood at 0.84 percent in August 2014, down from 0.95 percent a month earlier. At the same time, the average annual inflation rate remained on a downward path and came in at 1.2 percent in August 2014 compared with 1.5 percent in the previous month, while the average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices  which is relevant for ensuring comparability at European level and assessing convergence with the European Union  decreased to 1.3 percent in August versus 1.4 percent in July. The annual pace of economic growth witnessed a slowdown, owing primarily to the deceleration in domestic demand dynamics, largely attributable to the negative contribution of gross fixed capital formation. On the supply side, most economic sectors reported a relatively less favourable performance than in the previous period, consisting either in slower annual growth rates (industry and services) or contractions in business volumes (construction). Domestic currency lending in real terms saw a faster pace of increase, amid lower lending rates on new business to companies and households as a result of the pass-through of policy rate signals. At the same time, the dynamics of foreign currency credit remained deep in negative territory. Consequently, the share of foreign exchange loans in total credit to the private sector narrowed to 57.1 percent in August 2014 from 58.0 percent in June 2014 and 64.4 percent in May 2012. Hence, the real dynamics of total non-government credit (domestic and foreign currencies) continued to post negative readings, also on the back of stepped-up operations to remove non-performing loans from credit institutions' balance sheets. Against this background, the NBR Board decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 3.0 percent per annum, from 3.25 percent, starting 1 October 2014 and to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system. At the same time, in order to establish favourable prerequisites for the sustainable recovery of lending and to continue the harmonisation of the reserve requirements mechanism with the standards and practices in the field pursued by the European Central Bank and the major central banks of EU Member States, the NBR Board decided to cut the minimum reserve requirements ratio on leu-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 10 percent from 12 percent starting with the 24 October-23 November 2014 maintenance period and to maintain the minimum reserve requirements ratio on foreign currency-denominated liabilities at 16 percent. Moreover, with a view to mitigating interbank money market rate volatility and consolidating the transmission of the policy rate signal, the NBR Board decided to narrow the symmetrical corridor of interest rates on NBR's standing facilities around the policy rate to ±2.75 percentage points from ±3 percentage points. These decisions are meant to ensure price stability over the medium term in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat target, along with creating favourable conditions for the sustainable recovery of lending, which is likely to help achieve balanced and lasting economic growth. The consistent implementation of an adequate macroeconomic policy mix along the lines of the external financing arrangements and the resumption, by observing prudential rules, of financial intermediation in parallel with an appropriate remuneration of bank deposits are pivotal in consolidating the favourable prospects for the Romanian economy, thereby enhancing its resilience to external shocks. In line with the approved calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 4 November 2014, when the new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Euroarea,2014-10-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I would like to thank Governor Visco for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with our forward guidance, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Following up on the decisions of 4 September 2014, we also decided on the key operational details of both the asset-backed securities purchase programme and the new covered bond purchase programme. This will allow us to start purchasing covered bonds and asset-backed securities (ABSs) in the fourth quarter of 2014, starting with covered bonds in the second half of October. Together with the series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations to be conducted until June 2016, these purchases will have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet. The new measures will support specific market segments that play a key role in the financing of the economy. They will thereby further enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, facilitate credit provision to the broad economy and generate positive spillovers to other markets. Taking into account the overall subdued outlook for inflation, the weakening in the euro area's growth momentum over the recent past and the continued subdued monetary and credit dynamics, our asset purchases should ease the monetary policy stance more broadly. They should also strengthen our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates and reinforce the fact that there are significant and increasing differences in the monetary policy cycle between major advanced economies. Together with the monetary accommodation already in place, the determined implementation of the new measures will underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations, in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. As all our measures work their way through to the economy they will contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to our aim. Should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation, the Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate. A separate press release will provide further information on the modalities of our new purchase programmes for ABSs and covered bonds. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following four quarters of moderate expansion, euro area real GDP remained unchanged between the first and second quarter of this year. Survey data available up to September confirm the weakening in the euro area's growth momentum, while remaining consistent with a modest economic expansion in the second half of the year. Looking ahead to 2015, the outlook for a moderate recovery in the euro area remains in place, but the main factors and assumptions shaping this assessment need to be monitored closely. Domestic demand should be supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing improvements in financial conditions, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, and lower energy prices supporting real disposable income. Furthermore, demand for exports should benefit from the global recovery. At the same time, the recovery is likely to continue to be dampened by high unemployment, sizeable unutilised capacity, continued negative bank loan growth to the private sector, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside. In particular, the recent weakening in the euro area's growth momentum, alongside heightened geopolitical risks, could dampen confidence and, in particular, private investment. In addition, insufficient progress in structural reforms in euro area countries constitutes a key downward risk to the economic outlook. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.3% in September 2014, after 0.4% in August. Compared with the previous month, this reflects a stronger decline in energy prices and somewhat lower price increases in most other components of the HICP. On the basis of current information, annual HICP inflation is expected to remain at low levels over the coming months, before increasing gradually during 2015 and 2016. The Governing Council will continue to closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. In this context, we will focus in particular on the possible repercussions of dampened growth dynamics, geopolitical developments, exchange rate developments and the pass-through of our monetary policy measures. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for August 2014 continue to point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (M3), with the annual growth rate increasing moderately to 2.0% in August, after 1.8% in July. Annual growth in M3 continues to be supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 5.8% in August. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained negative at -2.0% in August, after -2.2% in the previous month. On average over recent months, net redemptions have moderated from the historically high levels recorded a year ago. Lending to non-financial corporations continues to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.5% in August, broadly unchanged since the beginning of 2013. Against the background of weak credit growth, the ECB is now close to finalising the comprehensive assessment of banks' balance sheets, which is of key importance to overcome credit supply constraints. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirms the recent decisions taken by the Governing Council to provide further monetary policy accommodation and to support lending to the real economy. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. However, in order to strengthen investment activity, job creation and potential growth, other policy areas need to contribute decisively. In particular, the legislation and implementation of structural reforms clearly need to gain momentum in several countries. This applies to product and labour markets as well as to actions to improve the business environment for firms. As regards fiscal policies, euro area countries should not unravel the progress already made and should proceed in line with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. This should be reflected in the draft budgetary plans for 2015 that governments will now deliver, in which they will address the relevant country-specific recommendations. The Pact should remain the anchor for confidence in sustainable public finances, and the existing flexibility within the rules should allow governments to address the budgetary costs of major structural reforms, to support demand and to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies. A full and consistent implementation of the euro area's existing fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance framework is key to bringing down high public debt ratios, to raising potential growth and to increasing the euro area's resilience to shocks."
Poland,2014-10-08,"Warsaw, 8 October 2014 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 7-8 October 2014 The Council set NBP interest rates at the following levels:  reference rate at 2.00% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 3.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate at 2.25% on an annual basis. The Council also decided that required reserve funds will be remunerated at 0.9 of the NBP reference rate. Growth in global economic activity remains moderate, although economic situation varies across countries. Economic recovery in the United States continues and economic outlook remains positive. At the same time, economic activity in the euro area is still subdued and the business climate indicators have recently deteriorated. In the largest emerging market economies GDP growth is also relatively low and in some of them, including Russia, has been decelerating. Prices of many agricultural and energy commodities have decreased in recent months. Along with moderate global economic growth, this contributes to low inflation in many countries. In Poland's immediate environment  including the euro area and the Central and Eastern Europe  inflation remains close to zero. Major central banks continue their expansionary monetary policy. At the same time, as economic situation varies across major economies, monetary policies in these economies are diverging. While the Federal Reserve has been tapering its asset purchase program, the European Central Bank has increased monetary expansion. In Poland, data on economic activity in 2014 Q3 point to a further deceleration in economic growth. This is indicated by a slowing growth in industrial production, construction and assembly as well as retail sales in recent months. Lower economic activity growth is also indicated by a decrease in business climate indices. Despite lower economic activity growth, employment in the corporate sector continues to rise. Growing employment contributes to a decline in unemployment. Yet, the unemployment rate remains elevated, which continues to contain wage pressure. As a result, wage growth in the enterprise sector remains moderate. At the same time, expansion in lending to the corporate sector and households has stabilized. In August, the CPI inflation declined again and remained negative (-0.3% y/y). The decline in prices was mostly driven by falling food prices against high supply of agricultural products, lower prices of commodities in the global markets and the Russian embargo on food imports. At the same time, core inflation remained very low, which confirms the absence of demand pressure in the economy. The continued decline in producer prices points, in turn, to the absence of cost pressure. This is accompanied by very low inflation expectations of enterprises and households. In the opinion of the Council, the incoming data point to a deceleration in economic growth and an increased risk of inflation running below the target in the medium term. Therefore, the Council decided to lower NBP interest rates, except for the deposit rate, which remained unchanged, narrowing the spread between lombard and deposit rate. The Council does not rule out further adjustment of monetary policy, should the incoming data, including the November NBP projection, confirm a considerable risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term."
South Korea,2014-10-15,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 2.25% to 2.00%. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 2.25% to 2.00%. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that, although the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area has continued while trends of economic growth in emerging market countries have differed from country to country. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by the changes in global financial market conditions stemming from the shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance, by the prolongation of economic sluggishness in the euro area, by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries, and by geopolitical risks. In Korea, while exports have sustained a favorable pattern and consumption has improved somewhat, the Committee judges that facilities investment remains sluggish and that economic agents' sentiment has only partially recovered. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has expanded steadily, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will gradually narrow going forward, although the time of its disappearance will be somewhat later than previously forecast. Consumer price inflation fell from 1.4% the month before to 1.1% in September, due mainly to an increase in the extent of decline in petroleum product prices and to slowdowns in the rates of industrial product price increase. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell to 1.9%, from 2.4% in August. The Committee forecasts that, after remaining low due primarily to the stability of agricultural and international oil prices, inflation will gradually rise next year; it judges, however, that inflationary pressures will be somewhat weaker than previously expected. In the housing market, the upward trends of sales prices in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country accelerated. As to leasehold deposit prices, the scale of their increase widened somewhat in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while their uptrend in the rest of the country exhibited a pace similar to that in the preceding month. In the domestic financial markets, amid heightened international financial market volatility, stock prices have fallen significantly, influenced for example by a shift to net selling of stocks by foreign investors. The Korean won has depreciated rapidly, and long-term interest rates have fallen substantially. Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay greater attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as the shift in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance, as well as the trends of household debt and of capital flows."
Peru,2014-10-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2014 BCRP MAINTAINED THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 3.50 percent. This level of the reference rate is compatible with a projected rate of inflation within the target range in 2014 and with inflation converging to 2.0 percent in 2015. This forecast takes into account that: current and advanced indicators of economic activity continue to show a pace of growth below their potential; inflation expectations remain anchored within the inflation target range; recent international indicators show mixed signals of recovery in the world economy, as well as higher volatility in financial and exchange markets, and the supply factors that led inflation to increase are moderating. Inflation in September showed a rate of 0.16 percent, as a result of which inflation in the last 12 months rose from 2.69 percent in August to 2.74 percent in September, within the target range. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.09 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation rose from 2.56 percent in August to 2.57 percent in September. Current and advanced indicators of activity continue to show a weak economic cycle, with lower GDP growth rates than the potential output, although some signals of recovery have been observed in September. In October, the BCRP has continued lowering the rate of reserve requirements in domestic currency from 11.0 to 10.5 percent with the aim of supporting the growth of credit in soles. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, and will implement additional monetary easing measures if it is necessary. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 2.30 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.30 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.30 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for November on its meeting of November 13, 2014."
Chile,2014-10-16,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 16 October 2014 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 3.0% (annual). Internationally, recent indicators suggest that, in the incoming quarters, world growth and inflation could be somewhat lower than expected. The prices of commodities, including copper, have declined, with a notorious drop in world fuel prices. Most recently, interest rates have fallen in developed countries, while volatility has increased in financial markets. Most emerging economies are showing higher risk premiums and depreciated currencies. Output, demand and employment indicators continue to reveal the low dynamism of the Chilean economy, in line with forecasts. Local financing conditions reflect the impact of the monetary stimulus. September's inflation was again higher than expected, at 4.9% y-o-y. The most likely scenario assumes that inflation will stay above the upper bound of the tolerance range still for some months, to later return to the target. This evolution will continue to be monitored with special attention. Medium- term inflation expectations have remained around 3%. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2014-10-16,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release October 16, 2014 In its meeting held on October 16, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 925 percent, 1025 percent, and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 975 percen. Headline CPI inched up by 123 percent (m/m) in September, following an increase of 109 percent and 351 percent (m/m) in August and July, respectivel. This brings the annual rate to 1112 percent in September, after it increased to 1149 percent in August up from 1104 percent in July, on the back of the favorable base effect from the previous yea. Effects of the regulated price adjustments implemented in July 2014 explain the bulk of the price developments during the quarte. Moreover while the prices of food items decelerated in August, there was a seasonal pick up in September which coincided with Eid El-Adh. In the meantime, core CPI increased by 084 percent (m/m) in September compared to an inch up of 060 percent 179 percent (m/m) in August and July, respectivel. The annual rate eased to 915 percent in September, after it increased to 1007 percent in August up from 957 percent in July, also due to the favorable base effect from the previous yea. While higher than anticipated indirect and second round effects resulting from the July 2014 regulated price adjustments pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook, upside risks from imported inflation continue to be contained on the back of lower international food price forecasts in light of global development. Meanwhile real GDP picked up significantly in 2013/2014 Q4, growing by 370 percent compared to 250 percent, 144 percent and 104 percent recorded in Q3. Q2 and Q1, respectivel. This brought the annual growth rate for the whole FY2013/2014 to 22 percent following a similarly sluggish growth rate of 21 percent during FY2012/201. The expansion in economic activity during 2013/2014 Q4 came on the back of the acceleration in manufacturing and real estate activities, along with a moderate growth in the construction secto. This occurred despite the continued contraction witnessed in the tourism and petroleum sector. In the meantime, investment continues to be below historical levels despite the relative improvement witnessed in the annual growth rate during 2013/2014 Q3 and Q4, following six quarters of contractio. Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects such as the Suez Canal are expected to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GDP. At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate to anchor inflation expectations and limit a generalized price increase given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlook. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Sub Governor.

Philippines,2014-10-22,"Statement by BSP Governor Amando M Tetangco Jr. At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy rates at 4.00 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.00 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs and special deposit accounts (SDA) were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were left unchanged as well. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment of a more manageable inflation environment, based on latest baseline projections indicating within-target inflation for the policy horizon. Latest forecasts show a lower inflation path for 2014-2016, reflecting easing pressures on commodity prices. Inflation expectations have also remained broadly stable and aligned to the inflation target. At the same time, domestic demand conditions continue to be resilient, supported by adequate domestic liquidity and robust bank lending growth. The Monetary Board noted that the risks to the inflation outlook are broadly balanced, with potential price pressures emanating from pending petitions for adjustments in utility rates and possible power shortages. Meanwhile, global economic prospects are likely to stay uneven, thus mitigating upward pressures from commodity prices going forward. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board deemed it prudent for the time being to allow previous monetary responses to continue to work their way through the economy. The Monetary Board emphasized that the BSP will remain vigilant against developments that could affect the outlook for inflation and financial stability and is prepared to take appropriate policy action as necessary to safeguard its price and financial stability objectives."
Turkiye,2014-10-23,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 11.25 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.5 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 8.25 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.75 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Exports remain supportive of balanced growth in spite of weakening global demand. Macroprudential measures taken at the beginning of the year and the tight monetary policy stance continue to have a favorable impact on the core inflation trend. However, elevated food prices delay the improvement in the inflation outlook. Meanwhile, current levels of commodity prices, in particular declining oil prices, are expected to contribute to disinflation foreseen for the next year. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days.

Israel,2014-10-27,"The inflation environment continued to decline this month. The inflation rate measured over the preceding 12 months was negative 0.3 percent. Inflation expectations for the coming year, from various sources, declined to below the lower bound of the inflationtarget range, and two-year expectations are at the lower bound. Expectations for longer terms declined as well, though they are near to the midpoint of the target range. Most indicators that became availablethis month signal that activity in the third quarter slowed, and perhaps even declined. Most of the slowdown in activity derives from Operation Protective Edge. The Companies Survey points to a decline in activity in the third quarter in all industries, primarily in tourism. There was no substantial decline in confidence indices despite Operation Protective Edge, and there was improvement in the Purchasing Managers Index. In light of the reductions in the Bank of Israel interest rate, and the strengthening of the dollar worldwide, the shekel weakened by 2.8 percent this month in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and it has weakened by about 4.1 percent since the beginning of the year. Continued depreciation will support a recovery in exportsand in the tradable sector as a whole, and is expected to contribute to returning the inflation rate to within the target range. Concern increased this month of a further moderation in the global economy, against the background of the increased uncertainty and volatility in various markets. Disappointing data were received this month in the eurozone, with an emphasis on its larger economies. In the US, the recovery in growth continues, though there are downside risks to the forecast. Based on market assessments, the timing of when the Fed will begin to raise the federal funds rate has been deferred to around October 2015. The sharp decline in the number of transactions in the housing market continues, and there is a moderation in the rate of mortgages being taken out. Home prices declined by 1 percent in July-August, and their rate of increase over the 12 months ending in August slowed to 5 percent. It is difficult to assess the response that will occurwhen the uncertainty regarding the zero-VAT law is removed. Net new investment in corporate bond funds continues, though at relatively low volumes. Spreads in this market continue to indicate an apparent underpricing of risks. Backgrounds Conditions. Inflation and interest rate forecasts:This month, 1-year inflation expectations (seasonally adjusted) derived from the capital market declined sharply to 0.6 percent, and expectationsfor two years also declined, to 1.0 percent. Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings declined to 0.9 percent, on average. Expectations for the coming 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates declined to 0.5 percent. Expectations for medium and long terms continued to decline this month, by about 15 basis points for long terms and by about 10 basis points for medium terms, compared to last month. Some private forecasters expect some reduction in the Bank of Israelinterest rate during the next three months, and this expectation is also indicated in data from the makam and Telbor curves. Real economic activity: Some monthly indicators of real economic activity have not been updated since the previous Monetary Committee discussion, due to the holidays. Most data which became available this month indicate that due to Operation Protective Edge, activity in the third quarter slowed, and perhaps even declined, although there are signs of recovery in September. Goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft and diamonds) increased moderately, by 1.3 percent, in September, after declining by 6 percent in August, and imports (excluding ships, aircraft, diamonds and fuels) declined by 3.9 percent. The export of other business services (excluding startups) declined by 0.9 percent in July, compared with the peak levels of the second quarter. There was a very slight recoveryin the number of tourist entries in September, following the low reached in July-August. The Bank of Israel's Companies Survey for the third quarter showed a decline in business sector activity, reflected in the fact that the weighted net balance is significantly negative. All industries reviewed in the Companies Survey show negative net balances, with thesharpest decline in hotels' activity. The business sector Climate Index, based on the Business Tendency Survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics for September, reflects a monthly growth rate of 0.16 percent. This is an improvement compared with the rate of 0.13 percent in August, but is still significantly lower than the rate in the months prior to Operation Protective Edge: 0.22 percent to 0.27 percent. The PurchasingManagers Index increased by 7.3 points to 49.9 points in September, the level that distinguishes between contraction and expansion, following a marked decline in July and August. Consumer confidence indices show a mixed picture: The Central Bureau of Statistics index improved in September compared to August, the Bank Hapoalim index declined, and the Globes Index remained virtually unchanged. The labor market: The number of employee posts declined by 0.3 percent in July compared with the second quarter, with a decline of 1.1 percent in the business sector offset by an increase of 0.7 percent in public services. The number of full time positions declined by about 0.8 percent in July-August compared with the secondquarter. Health tax receipts are increasing at a stable rate: receipts in August-September were 5.5 percent higher (in nominal terms) than the same period last year, compared to a year over year increase of 4.8 percent in July-August. Nominal wages increased in May-July by 0.9 percent, and real wages increased by 0.7 percent, compared to February-April (seasonally adjusted data). Budget data: In JanuaryC 2AD-September, the deficit in the government's domestic activity (excluding net credit) totaled about NIS 7.2 billion. This is about NIS 3.6 billion smaller than the deficit in the seasonal path consistent with meeting the 2014 deficit target, as expenditure has been lower than the seasonal path consistent with full budget performance. Ministry expenditures are only 3.4 percent greater in nominal terms than the same period last year. With that, an acceleration in expenditure is expected over the remainder of the year. Domestic revenues from the beginning of the year are about NIS 1.5 billion lower than the seasonal path consistent with the budget forecast. Based on trend data. VAT on gross domestic activity: an indicator ofprivate consumption: increased by about 0.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with the previous quarter. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on September 21, 2014, through October 24, 2014, the shekel weakened by 4.1 percent against the dollar, and by 2 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel weakened by 2.8 percent. For the year to date, the shekel has weakenedby about 4.1 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on September 21, 2014, through October 24,2014, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by 0.9 percent, a smaller decline than the worldwide trend. Yields in the government bond market declined sharply, mainly against the background of a decline in yields abroad. Yields on the unindexed bond yield curve declined by up to 35 basis points, with a decline in the steepness of the curve. The yield on the 10-year unindexed bonddeclined by about 35 basis points, to 2.1 percent. The decline in yields on the CPI-indexed curve was more moderate, and reflected a decline in the inflation expectation implied in the medium and long portions of the curve. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and corresponding 10-year US Treasury securities remained virtually unchanged, at a negative level of about 15 basis points. Makam yields declined by about 5-8 basis points along the entire curve, and the 1-year yield is 0.17 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread remained virtually unchanged at 89 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in September, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 24.6 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 7.9 percent. The credit markets: Total outstanding debt of the business sector increased by about NIS 10.6 billion (1.4 percent) in August, to NIS 781 billion, mostly a result of the depreciation of the shekel against the dollar, which increased the shekel value of debt indexed to and denominated in foreign currency. However, the figure also reflects net debt raised of about NIS 2 billion, mainly in the nonbank market.In September, the nonfinancial business sector issued about NIS 4.1 billion in bonds, compared with a monthly average of NIS 3.6 billion since the beginning of the year. Net new investment in corporate bond mutual funds continued, though at a lower volume than during the first months of the year. Corporate bond market spreads remained low, at a level that may indicate theunderpricing of risk in this market. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 1.9 billion (0.5 percent) in August, to about NIS 425 billion. The increase derived mostly from continued growth in housing debt, which increased by NIS 1.5 billion. In September, new mortgages taken out totaled NIS 3.9 billion, compared with a monthly average of about NIS 4.3 billion since the beginning of the year. The interest rate on new variable-rate, unindexed mortgages taken out declined in September by 0.17 percentage points,against the background of the decline in the Bank of Israel interest rate. The average interest rate increased by about 0.04 percentage points on newCPI-indexed, fixed rate mortgages, and by 0.14 percentage points on new CPI-indexed, variable rate mortgages. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) remained unchanged in September, after increasing for 7 consecutive months at an average monthly rate of 0.5 percent. In the 12 months ending in September, this component increased by 2.1 percent, and over the course of the year a trend of decline is apparent in its rate of increase. Home prices, which are measured in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in theCPI, declined by 1 percent in July-August. The annual rate of growth in prices moderated, such that over the 12 months ending in August, homeprices increased by 5 percent, compared with an increase of 6.5 percent in the 12 months ended in July. The number of transactions in the housing market continues to decline sharply. The volume of such transactions in the second quarter was about 20 percent lower than in the first quarter, and partial data show that there was a similar decline in the third quarter. The decline encompassed all types of transactions, but it appears that it was especially sharp for homes priced at up to NIS 1.6 million. In the 12 months ended in July, there were about 45,000 building starts. The global economy: Concern about further moderation in the global economy increased this month, against the background of an increase in uncertainty and in volatility on various markets. The IMF reduced its global growth forecast for 2015 by 0.2 percentage points, to 3.8 percent. The forecast for world trade growth was reduced by 0.3 percentage points, to 5 percent, concurrent with a decline in world trade in August. In the US, the recovery in growth continued, but in the background are a significant number of downside risks to the forecast. Despite the improvement in the labor market, most of those joining the labor force are earning low salaries, so that salaries increased at a moderate pace and continue to weigh on a recovery in personal consumption. The dollar continues to strengthen vis-C 3A 0-vis the basket of major currencies (DXY), which may also weigh on the recovery of the US economy. The global economic environment and comments by leading Fed officials led to a change in market estimates of the timing of the start of interest rate increases in the US, which is now expected to be delayed by a few months to around October 2015. In the eurozone, the flow of disappointing data continues. Germany's economy has weakened, and the French and Italian economies are having difficulty recovering. The IMF reduced its forecast for eurozone growth in 2015 by 0.2 percentage points, to 1.3 percent. Companies surveys and expectationsindices continue to weaken and to indicate negative sentiment. The unemployment rate remains high, at 11.5 percent. The annual inflation rate declined to a new low of 0.3 percent, and concerns of deflation are increasing. The ECB published the details of an asset purchasing program, which were received with some disappointment in the markets since it did not include quantitative targets. In Japan as well, most of the data published this month were disappointing, and indicated the lack of recovery since the VAT increasein April. The Bank of Japan repeated its commitment to adopt accommodativepolicy as long as necessary. The growth rate in the Chinese economy is stabilizing, and the composition of growth improved recently, while in the background, the decline in real estate prices continued. In Brazil there is continued instability, while data for India indicate a mixed trend. Concerns over the weakening global economy led to sharp fluctuations in stock markets, and the MSCI World index declined by about 3.5 percent at the end of theperiod. Due to the concern over weakness in global activity, and despite the geopolitical instability in Ukraine and the Middle East, energy prices continue to decline sharply. The price of a barrel of Brent Sea crude oil declined by 15 percent to $86. In contrast, agricultural commodity prices increased by 5 percent this month. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for November 2014 unchanged at 0.25 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, whichis intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerationsunderlying the decision:. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the effects of the recent interest rate reductions, which brought the interest rate to a level of 0.25 percent, have not yet been fully reflectedin activity and in inflation, and in light of that decided to keep the interest rate unchanged this month. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need touse various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for November 2014 will be published on November 10, 2014. The decision regarding the interest rate for December 2014 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. November 24, 2014."
Hungary,2014-10-28,"At its meeting on 28 October 2014, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 2.10%. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening, output remains below potential and the domestic real economy is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact, albeit to a diminishing extent. Despite the pick-up in the components of domestic demand, capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungary's export markets. With employment rising, the unemployment rate continues to exceed its long-term level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Based on the inflation data for September, consumer prices continue to show historically low dynamics. In addition to one-off inflation-reducing effects, the Bank's measures of underlying inflation capturing the medium-term outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy, reflecting low inflation in external markets, favourable developments in commodity prices and imported inflation, the degree of unused capacity in the economy, subdued wage dynamics, the fall in inflation expectations and the reductions in administered energy prices implemented in a series of steps. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact and low inflation is likely to persist for a sustained period. However, domestic demand-side disinflationary pressures are weakening gradually as activity gathers pace, and inflation is likely to reach levels around 3 per cent consistent with price stability in the second half of the forecast period. In the Council's judgement, economic growth is likely to continue even as external demand has weakened slightly. The decline in industrial production and foreign trade in August may have partly reflected one-off effects. The growth rate of retail sales picked up further in August. In the Council's judgement, economic growth may continue in a more balanced pattern than previously, with the recovery in domestic demand likely to make a greater contribution. The increasing use of EU funding and the easing in credit constraints also due to the Bank's Funding for Growth Scheme are expected to sustain the recovery in investment. Household consumption is likely to grow gradually, mainly as a result of the expected increase in the real value of disposable income and the reduced need for deleveraging. However, propensity to save is expected to remain above levels seen prior to the crisis. Based on labour market data for August, the number of employees, including those employed under public employment programmes, was stagnant and the unemployment rate fell. International investor sentiment mostly deteriorated in the past month, mainly reflecting the escalation of geopolitical conflicts and the weak outlook for activity. The majority of domestic risk measures were broadly unchanged. Hungary's persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Council's judgement, a cautious approach to policy is warranted due to uncertainty about future developments in the global financial environment. In the Council's judgement, there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate in the medium term. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the monetary policy horizon. Looking ahead, therefore, the disinflationary impact of the real economy is likely to diminish and, with current monetary conditions maintained, inflation is likely to move into line with the target over the medium term. The Council judges that, based on available information, the current level of the central bank base rate is consistent with the medium-term achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support to the real economy. If the assumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, achieving the medium-term inflation target points in the direction of maintaining current loose monetary conditions for an extended period."
United States,2014-10-29,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions improved somewhat further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate. On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources is gradually diminishing. Household spending is rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced. Although inflation in the near term will likely be held down by lower energy prices and other factors, the Committee judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year. The Committee judges that there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market since the inception of its current asset purchase program. Moreover, the Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability. Accordingly, the Committee decided to conclude its asset purchase program this month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee anticipates, based on its current assessment, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated. Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Stanley Fischer; Richard W Fisher; Loretta J Mester; Charles I Plosser; Jerome H Powell; and Daniel K Tarullo. Voting against the action was Narayana Kocherlakota, who believed that, in light of continued sluggishness in the inflation outlook and the recent slide in market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, the Committee should commit to keeping the current target range for the federal funds rate at least until the one-to-two-year ahead inflation outlook has returned to 2 percent and should continue the asset purchase program at its current level. Statement Regarding Purchases of Treasury Securities and Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities."
Russia,2014-10-31,"On 31 October 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to raise the Bank of Russia key rate to 9.5 percent per annum. During September-October significant changes in external conditions have taken place: considerable fall in oil prices and stricter sanctions imposed by certain countries against several large Russian companies. As a result the ruble depreciated that together with restrictions on the import of certain food items imposed in August resulted in further acceleration in consumer prices growth. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, inflation will remain above 8% till the end of 2014 and in 2015 Q1. Continuing high growth of consumer price will result in persistent increase in inflation expectations creating additional inflation risks. The Bank of Russia will continue to take measures aimed at slowing down consumer prices growth to the target of 4% in the medium run. If the external conditions improve and inflation and inflation expectation show a stable downward trend, the Bank of Russia will be ready to start monetary policy easing. In September-October, inflation grew more rapidly than had been expected earlier. According to the estimates as of the 27 October, annual consumer price growth rate was 8.4%. Core inflation rose to 8.2% in September 2014. Acceleration of inflation was mainly provoked by accelerated price growth for food items from 10.3% in August to 11.4% in September. Price growth rates for non-food products remained stable at 5.5%. Inflation dynamics was mainly influenced by ruble depreciation and external trade restrictions imposed in August 2014. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, cumulative impact of these factors on the annual consumer prices growth to the end of the 2014 will be about 2.5 pp (of which 1.2 pp — impact of external trade restrictions imposed in August, 1.3 pp — impact of ruble depreciation). Amid accelerated consumer prices growth, inflation expectations of households and businesses continued to increase imposing additional pressure on prices. Tighter monetary conditions haven't offset the influence of the aforementioned factors on inflation expectations yet though monetary aggregates dynamics sets the ground for inflation decline in the medium run. According to the estimates, annual money supply (M2) growth rate decreased from 16.1% on 1 October 2013 to 7.4% on 1 October 2014. Continuing growth of interest rates on household deposits contributes to maintain the propensity to save and increase attractiveness of deposits for cash holdings. Given interest rates hike and tighter borrower and collateral requirements, lending growth sees a slowdown (adjusted for currency revaluation). According to the Bank of Russia estimates, annual GDP growth rate in 2014 Q3 was 0.2%. Economic slack does not have considerable restraining effect on consumer prices increase as it is mostly caused by structural factors. Utilisation of productive factors — labour force and commercially viable productive capacities — is high though labour productivity grows slowly. Due to the long-term demographic trends labour supply decreases. Besides structural factors, increased external political uncertainty has an adverse impact on economic activity. Amid limited access to long-term financing and higher borrower requirements from Russian banks, fixed capital investments are contracting. At the same time consumer demand is cooling down as real wage growth and retail lending are slowing. External economic conditions have restraining effect on the Russian economy: oil prices see a significant decline while economic activity of most Russia's trading partners remains weak. However, exchange rate dynamics and restrictions on the import of certain food items support some industries. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, economic growth rate in 2014 Q4 and 2015 Q1 will be close to zero. Consumer prices growth is very likely to persist at the current level till the end of Q1 2015 due to remaining sizeable impact of restrictions on the import of certain food items and ruble depreciation in August-October 2014 on prices. Later, as the economy gradually adjusts to external trade restrictions and the impact of exchange rate dynamics on prices reduction, inflation and inflation expectations are expected to see a renewed decrease. Slower consumer prices growth will also be facilitated by subdued aggregate demand with aggregate goods and services output remaining below the potential. However, inflation decline will be slower than previously expected. The Bank of Russia will continue to take measures aimed at stabilising inflation expectations and slowing down consumer prices growth to the target in the medium term. Should the external conditions improve, and inflation and inflation expectation show a stable downward trend, the Bank of Russia will be ready to start monetary policy easing. The next meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors on the key rate is scheduled for 11 December 2014. The press-release on the Bank of Russia Board of Directors' decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Turkiye,2014-10-31,"2. Annual food inflation fell to 13.95 percent. In September, annual inflation dropped in both unprocessed and processed food but remained elevated due to adverse weather conditions and the cumulative effects of exchange rates. However, indicators for October point to some decline in annual unprocessed food inflation. 3. Falling to 1.38 percent in September, annual energy inflation contribute favorably to consumer inflation. Having decreased due to the weakening global demand, international oil prices are expected to continue to support this outlook. Yet, the October adjustments on natural gas and electricity tariffs are likely to drive energy prices significantly higher. These hikes are forecasted to add about 0.4 percentage points to annual consumer inflation. 4. Prices of services rose by 0.9 percent in September and annual services inflation remained constant around 8.96 percent. In this period, restaurants and hotels inflation maintained its high level with 14.43 percent, while transport and rent inflation maintained their upward trend that has been accelerating in recent months. Annual core goods inflation dropped to 9.42 percent in this period. Annual inflation continued to fall in durable goods but rose further, albeit more slowly, in core goods excluding durables and clothing, which are affected by the exchange rate developments with a further lag. In line with the outlook on prices of services and core goods, underlying core inflation indicators continued to improve. 5. In sum, elevated food prices delay the improvement in the inflation outlook, yet falling commodity, especially oil, prices, are expected to support disinflation foreseen for the next year. Factors Affecting Inflation 6. Data for the third-quarter of 2014 show a moderate quarter-on-quarter increase in economic activity. On the production side, the industrial production index decreased by 1.4 percent in August after growing by 1.9 percent in July. Thus, during July-August, production rose by 1.1 percent quarter-on-quarter. With the support of exports, this outlook is expected to be preserved in September as well. 7. Data on the expenditure side point to a moderate recovery in domestic private demand for the third quarter after the first-half decline. During July-August, the production of durable and nondurable consumer goods and imports of total consumer goods recorded increases. Similarly, the sales of automobiles and home appliances have picked up on the back of more favorable financial conditions. Among indicators for machinery-equipment investments, the production of investment goods excluding transport rose during July-August while their imports decreased. Meanwhile, the production of minerals, an indicator for construction investments, declined whereas their imports continued to rise. Given the fall in construction employment, it is assessed that private construction investments have slowed in the third quarter. Thus, private consumer spending is expected to rebound quarter-on- quarter whereas private investment demand may continue its weak course in the third quarter. On the other hand, data on third-quarter budget spending indicate that public demand might support growth in the third quarter. 8. In August, the non-gold import index nearly flattened out month-on-month while the non-gold export index was down by 7.9 percent due to geopolitical tensions and the automotive industry's August holiday scheme. Indicators for September point to a monthly fall in non-gold imports and to a rise in non-gold exports due to increased exports to Iraq and the pickup in the automotive industry compensating for the August decline. Hence, non-gold imports may post a slight quarterly increase in the third quarter of the year, whereas non-gold exports will remain flat. Moreover, it is assessed that weak global demand and geopolitical risks might continue to limit the contribution of net exports to growth in the final quarter. In July, total and nonfarm unemployment rates were higher than in the previous period in seasonally adjusted terms. The rise in unemployment was largely due to weak outlook in non-farm employment. Yet the increase in labor force participation is marked. In this period, the downtrend in construction employment halted, while losses in industrial employment persisted. Meanwhile, services employment continued to support nonfarm employment. Leading indicators for the third quarter fail to signal a positive outlook for nonfarm employment. The low levels of investment tendency and the moderate growth in industrial production suggest that a recovery in the labor market may take some time. To sum up, third-quarter data indicate that private domestic demand recovered modestly. As suggested by surveys, the moderate recovery of domestic demand may continue into the final quarter. However, a possible slowdown across European economies and geopolitical tensions may cause external demand to weaken. Therefore, economic activity is expected to grow moderately and gradually in the second half of the year. On the other hand, uncertainty over global monetary policies, the recent increase of volatility in financial markets and the weak consumer and investor confidence pose downside risks on growth. Thus, demand conditions are expected to limit the upside pressures on inflation while domestic demand developments will support the improvement in current account balance. Monetary Policy and Risks 11. The Committee assessed the medium-term forecasts projected to be included in the October Inflation Report. Due to the negative supply-side developments, food prices remained elevated in the third quarter of 2014, which led the annual consumer inflation to exceed the forecasts presented in July Inflation Report. Upon the evaluation of assumptions underlying inflation forecasts and external conditions, given the developments in import and oil prices, food prices, energy price adjustments, output gap and the underlying inflation trend, year-end inflation forecasts for 2014 and 2015 were revised upwards. Global financial markets have recently followed a volatile course. While, the Fed terminated its quantitative easing program, the timing and magnitude of the policy rate increase remained uncertain. The ECB reduced policy rates against the risks of economic slowdown and deflation and announced a new quantitative easing program through the purchase of covered bonds and asset-backed securities. Persisting uncertainties regarding global monetary policies and the downturn in global economic activity may lead to volatility in capital inflows towards emerging economies as well as their risk indicators. The Committee stated that the reduction in interest rates on the foreign exchange deposits that banks can borrow from the CBRT within their borrowing limits in the Foreign Exchange Deposit Market would support balanced growth and continuity of capital inflows towards Turkey during the normalization of global monetary policies. In addition, it is important to further strengthen the current healthy structure of the banking sector. Accordingly, the Committee stated that introducing an additional support to the core liabilities of financial institutions through remuneration of required reserves which are held in Turkish lira would spur balanced growth and domestic savings. Elevated food prices delay the improvement in the inflation outlook. Unfavorable developments in food prices were mainly driven by supply conditions. Should supply conditions make no additional negative contribution in 2015, and food inflation near its averages of past years, there will be a considerable room for decline in inflation through this channel. Due to the recently-weakening global demand, falling commodity prices, oil in particular, are expected to support the disinflation process projected for 2015. In contrast to these positive developments in the inflation outlook, the current elevated levels of inflation affect the medium-term expectations adversely and boost risks related to pricing behavior. The Committee will closely monitor inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation, and maintain a tight monetary policy stance by keeping a flat yield curve until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. Growth rates and composition of loans evolve in the desired direction, owing to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Consumer loan growth followed a weak course, while commercial loan growth was relatively more robust. This favorable outlook of loans both contributes to disinflation and support rebalancing of the current account. Additional tightening measures will be taken should credit growth accelerate in a way that poses upside risks to inflation and aggravates financial risks by distorting the rebalancing process. Recently-released data point to a deceleration in economic activity. An overall slowdown in growth in the global economy has been observed in the second and third quarters of 2014. Languishing external demand due to halting growth in the European countries, the largest export market of Turkey, besides geopolitical developments in neighboring countries limit the growth of exports. Falling commodity prices due to the weak global demand are expected to restrict growth in imports and improve the current account balance. Meanwhile, on account of the lingering volatility in financial markets and the sluggish course of confidence indices, private sector final demand does not exhibit a steady recovery. Therefore, it is expected that the projected recovery in economic activity will be gradual and aggregate demand developments will support the disinflation process. In the case of an additional slowdown in external demand and a sizeable decline in global growth rates, the decrease in commodity prices will pull inflation down. Nevertheless, domestic economic activity may witness notable adverse effects at the same time. Under such circumstances, the Committee will employ policy tools to support the economy. Macroprudential measures taken at the beginning of the year coupled with the tight monetary stance have a favorable effect on the core inflation trend. Having significantly increased in early 2014, trend of core inflation indicators H and I have recently improved and most of the rise in inflation trend was taken back by the third quarter. Accordingly, the adverse impact of exchange rate developments on annual inflation is tapering off. This channel is assessed to provide inflation with a considerable room for decline in 2015. However, second-round effects and inflation expectations need to be closely monitored. In the event that additional deteriorations occur in the medium-term inflation outlook, liquidity and monetary policies would be tightened. The Committee closely monitors developments on the fiscal policy and tax adjustments with regard to their effects on the inflation outlook. The baseline monetary stance is formulated under the assumption that fiscal discipline will be maintained and there will be no unanticipated hikes on administered prices in the forthcoming period. A revision of the monetary policy stance may be considered, should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently, have an adverse effect on the medium-term inflation outlook. Strengthening structural reforms that will ensure the sustainability of the fiscal discipline and reduce the savings deficit will support macroeconomic stability in the medium term. Steps taken in this regard will also provide more room for maneuvering the monetary policy and improving social welfare by keeping interest rates of long-term government securities at low levels. In this respect, implementing the structural reforms required by the Medium Term Program remains to be of utmost importance.

Armenia,2014-11-02,"Press Release 11.02.2014 Interest rate lowered by 0.25 percent In the February 11, 2014 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to lower the Refinancing Rate of CBA by 0.25 percent to 7.5 percent. Inflation in January of 2014 was 2.8 percent, with the 12-month inflation having amounted to 5.5 percent in late January and resting closer to the upper bound of the confidence band. In recent months inflation has subsided at a faster rate than forecasted, which was due to slower-than-expected economic activity and price falls on basic food commodities in international markets. The Board believes that in the coming months the 12-month inflation rate will continue to decline and rest closer to the lower bound of the band most probably during the third quarter, which will be attributable to phasing out impact of energy prices increased back in July of 2013. The Board acknowledged that the developments in the external sector were mainly in line with the projections. Trends of slower global economic recovery are maintained, a non-inflationary environment is persisting in global markets of commodities, while deflationary patterns are observable in food product markets in the world. In the light of such developments, no inflationary pressures are anticipated from the external environment in the forecast horizon. The Board estimates that despite some reviving of economic activity in the fourth quarter, economic growth rates remain sluggish, mostly driven by reduced value added in construction. The Board thinks that eased monetary conditions, coupled with expansionary fiscal policy and stabilizing private investment, which is expected since the second half of 2014, will lead to broadening of aggregate demand and rebounding inflation rates. As a result, late at the year the 12-month inflation will be expected to be around the target while economic growth around its equilibrium. Yet, the Board has consensus that there is a considerable amount of uncertainties over the developments in both the external and domestic environment. As long as such developments materialize, the Central Bank would steer further directions of the monetary policy while attempting to attain the inflation target in the medium run. More information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program Q1, 2014) due on February 21st of 2014. Press Service of the Central Bank."
Romania,2014-11-04,"With a view to mitigating interbank money market rate volatility and to consolidating the transmission of the policy rate signal, the NBR Board decided to narrow the symmetrical corridor of interest rates on NBR's standing facilities around the policy rate to ±2.50 percentage points from ±2.75 percentage points. Thus, starting 5 November 2014, the interest rate on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard) will be lowered to an annual 5.25 percent from 5.75 percent, while its deposit facility rate will remain at 0.25 percent per annum. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference on 6 November 2014. Statistical data show the annual inflation rate remaining at low levels after the fading of the impact arising from the cut in the VAT rate for some bakery products. The 12-month inflation rate followed a path lower than previously forecasted and ran close to the lower bound of the variation band of the target, mainly due to subdued developments in volatile food prices, low euro area inflation, as well as to the persistence of the negative output gap and the downward adjustment in inflation expectations. The annual inflation rate stood at 1.54 percent in September 2014, up from 0.84 percent a month earlier, amid the fading of the statistical effect of the 2013 VAT rate cut on milling and bakery products. At the same time, the average annual inflation rate remained unchanged at 1.2 percent in September, while the average annual inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices  which is relevant for assessing convergence with the European Union  came in at 1.3 percent, the same as in August. Looking at the real economy, the latest data point to a relative deceleration in the annual dynamics of industrial output, given that domestic demand further saw weak recovery, owing particularly to investment developments, and exports witnessed a slacker uptrend. The growth rate of domestic currency loans further posted positive readings, thanks to the pass-through of the successive policy rate cuts onto lending rates on new business to companies and households. However, the real annual dynamics of credit to the private sector remained in negative territory, against the background of the sharper contraction in foreign currency credit (stocks) and the ongoing operations to remove non-performing loans from credit institutions' balance sheets. In today's meeting, the NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report. Compared to the August forecast, the new projection shows a markedly lower expected inflation path. Thus, the annual inflation rate is seen coming in at 1.5 percent at end-2014 and at 2.2 percent at end-2015. The downward shift of the inflation trajectory stems primarily from the persistence of the negative output gap, the consolidation of inflation expectations at lower levels, as well as from the influence of subdued inflation and the weak economic recovery in the euro area and other European countries. The risks associated with the new projection further relate chiefly to the considerable uncertainty surrounding external developments, in particular capital flow volatility amid fluctuations in foreign investors' risk aversion in the context of monetary policy stance adjustments by major central banks worldwide, the ongoing cross-border deleveraging, and of the geopolitical tensions. Against this backdrop, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 2.75 percent per annum from 3.0 percent starting 5 November 2014 and to continue to pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system. Moreover, with a view to mitigating interbank money market rate volatility and consolidating the transmission of the policy rate signal, the NBR Board has decided to narrow the symmetrical corridor of interest rates on the NBR's standing facilities around the policy rate to ±2.50 percentage points from ±2.75 percentage points. At the same time, in order to continue the harmonisation of the reserve requirements mechanism with the standards and practices in the field pursued by the European Central Bank and the major central banks of EU Member States, the NBR Board has decided to cut the minimum reserve requirements ratio on foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 14 percent from 16 percent starting with the 24 November-23 December 2014 maintenance period. The minimum reserve requirements ratio on leu-denominated liabilities will remain unchanged at 10 percent. These decisions are meant to ensure price stability over the medium term in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat target, along with the sustainable recovery of lending, which is likely to help achieve balanced and lasting economic growth. The NBR Board reiterates that the consistent implementation of an adequate macroeconomic policy mix, along the lines of the external financing arrangements, and the resumption, by observing prudential rules, of financial intermediation in parallel with an appropriate remuneration of bank deposits are pivotal to consolidating economic growth and enhancing the resilience of the Romanian economy to external shocks. The NBR is restating that the adequate use and dosage of all its available tools, amid a close monitoring of domestic and global economic developments, will ensure the achievement of the overriding objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term, along with preserving financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 6 November 2014. According to the approved calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 7 January 2015.

Poland,2014-11-05,"Warsaw, 5 November 2014 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 4-5 November 2014 The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 2.00% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 3.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate at 2.25% on an annual basis. Growth in global economic activity remains moderate, although the economic situation varies across countries. In the United States, economic growth in 2013 Q3 remained relatively robust. In the euro area, economic activity is still low and the projections for economic growth in the euro area have been revised downwards. At the same time, the economic growth in the euro area next year is expected to be higher than this year. This is accompanied by a slowdown in GDP growth in China and growth in economic activity in Russia coming to a halt. Commodity prices, including for crude oil, have been recently falling. Along with moderate global economic growth, this contributes to low inflation in many countries. In Poland's immediate environment  including the euro area and Central and Eastern Europe  inflation remains close to zero. Major central banks continue their expansionary monetary policy. However, as the economic situation varies across major economies, monetary policies in these economies are also diverging. While the Federal Reserve has concluded its asset purchases, the European Central Bank has started purchasing assets and the Bank of Japan increased asset purchase programme significantly. In Poland, data on economic activity point to deceleration in economic growth in 2014 Q3. Growth in industrial production, construction and retail sales was lower in 2014 Q3 than in the previous quarter. This was accompanied by a deceleration of exports growth driven by economic slowdown in Poland's major trading partners. Despite lower economic activity growth, employment in the corporate sector continues to rise, which is conducive to a gradual decline in unemployment. Yet, the unemployment rate remains elevated, which continues to contain wage pressure. As a result, wages increase in a pace close to real GDP growth. At the same time, expansion in lending to households has been stable, while the growth in lending to the corporate sector has been increasing gradually. In September. CPI inflation remained negative at -0.3% y/y. The decline in prices, in annual terms, was mostly due to falling fuel prices, which resulted from a fall in oil prices in the global markets. Core inflation remained close to zero, which confirms the absence of demand pressure in the economy. The continued decline in producer prices points, in turn, to a lack of cost pressure. This is accompanied by very low inflation expectations of enterprises and households. The Council got acquainted with the inflation and GDP projection prepared by the Economic Institute. In line with the November projection based on the NECMOD model  prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 20 October 2014  there is a 50-per cent probability of inflation running in the range of 0.0-0.2% in 2014 (as compared to -0.1-0.4% in the July 2014 projection), 0.4-1.7% in 2015 (as against 0.5-2.1%) and 0.6-2.3% in 2016 (as against 1.3-3.1%). At the same time, the annual GDP growth  in line with the November projection  will be, with a 50-per cent probability, 2.9-3.5% in 2014 (as compared to 3.2- 4.1% in the July 2014 projection), 2.0-3.7% in 2015 (as against 2.6-4.5%) and 1.9-4.2% in 2016 (as against 2.3-4.5%). The economic growth and inflation risk distribution points to a greater probability of these variables remaining below the central projection throughout the whole projection horizon than above the central projection. In the opinion of the Council, the October adjustment of monetary policy and the stable, despite some slowdown, economic growth limit the risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term. Therefore, the Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged. However, the Council highlights that uncertainty regarding the economic conditions in the environment of the Polish economy persists. Therefore, the Council does not rule out further adjustment of monetary policy, should the incoming data point to a risk of deterioration in economic growth outlook. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  November 2014."
Czech Republic,2014-11-06,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. The forecast is based on the assumption that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until 2016 Q1. The subsequent return to conventional monetary policy will not imply appreciation of the exchange rate to the level recorded before the CNB started intervening, as the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to prices and other nominal variables. The forecast expects inflation to continue rising gradually and exceed the 2% target at the start of 2016. The Bank Board considers the risks to the new forecast to be balanced. In this situation, the Bank Board repeated that the Czech National Bank would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2016. Turning to the forecast assumptions regarding developments abroad, the currently weakening growth in euro area economic activity can be expected to accelerate significantly again in the course of 2015. Foreign producer prices are falling sharply this year, reflecting the previous long-running contraction in economic activity and currently low commodity prices. For the same reasons, euro area consumer price inflation is very low this year. Foreign producer and consumer price inflation is expected to pick up in 2015 thanks to an increase in economic growth and a weakening exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar. The very subdued inflation in the euro area and the related recent easing of monetary policy by the European Central Bank using unconventional instruments are reflected in a low outlook for foreign interest rates. Overall, the outlook for the euro area in the rest of this year and for next year has shifted towards slower economic growth and lower inflation. The euro is expected to continue depreciating against the US dollar in the next two years. A decrease in the dollar price of Brent crude oil in 2015 and 2016 reflects its current considerably reduced level. Overall, these shifts in the external environment are having a marked anti-inflationary effect on the forecast for the Czech economy. However, the lower outlook for oil prices simultaneously represents a favourable pro-growth supply-side impulse.Looking at developments in the Czech economy, inflation rebounded from near-zero levels in recent months, but remained below the lower boundary of the tolerance band around the Czech National Bank's target. The low inflation was due to a continuing decline in administered prices and subdued inflation in the euro area. The weakened exchange rate is still feeding through to inflation via import prices. Moreover, the domestic economy is now pushing prices upwards. The forecast expects headline inflation to continue rising gradually and slightly exceed the 2% target at the start of 2016. The inflationary effect of import prices will fade at the end of this year owing to the observed fall in producer prices in the euro area amid a stable exchange rate of the koruna. By contrast, the domestic economy will increasingly contribute to price growth, mainly as a result of accelerating wage growth. Monetary-policy relevant inflation, i.e. inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, will follow a similar path to headline inflation next year, although at a slightly lower level. In 2016 it will be the same as headline inflation, standing above the 2% target. Following a decline in GDP in the past two years, the Czech economy will grow by 2.5% this year according to the forecast. Domestic economic growth will be fostered by higher external demand, the strong easing of the domestic monetary conditions via the weakened exchange rate of the koruna and exceptionally low interest rates, and a recovery in government investment. The economy will show the same growth rate in 2015 and accelerate slightly in 2016. The growing economy is already manifesting itself in the labour market in renewed growth in the number of employees converted into full-time equivalents. This growth will continue over the next two years. New jobs are being created and the number of vacancies is at its highest level in more than five years. The unemployment rate will therefore continue to decrease gradually. Wage growth in the business sector will increase noticeably, and the same will apply to wages in the non-business sector in the near future. The forecast expects market interest rates to be flat at their current very low level and the koruna exchange rate to be used as a monetary policy instrument until 2016 Q1. By then, thanks to the economic recovery and rising wages, domestic inflation pressures should be sufficiently restored to allow a return to conventional monetary policy. However, this return should not result in the exchange rate appreciating to the level recorded before the Czech National Bank started intervening, as the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to the price level and other nominal variables. Short-term market rates are forecasted to increase by around 0.8 percentage point in 2016 Q2, after the exit from the regime of using the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument. Market interest rates will then rise further. The forecasts for headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation are lower than in the previous prediction until early 2016, owing to a lower outlook for net inflation. GDP growth has been revised downwards for 2014 and 2015, mainly on account of a lower outlook for external demand. The expected growth rate of nominal wages in the business sector has also shifted slightly lower for both 2014 and 2015, reflecting a more gradual return of inflation to the target and expected slightly less pronounced domestic economic growth. The interest rate path mainly reflects a stronger anti-inflationary effect of the external economy and domestic administered prices and a related postponement of the expected exit from the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument. The Bank Board considers the risks to the new forecast to be balanced. The inflation forecast for the rest of 2014 and for 2015 has shifted markedly lower, reflecting the very subdued inflation in the euro area. At the same time, the weaker current exchange rate level relative to the announced commitment is not only helping to return inflation to the 2% target, but also fostering continued sustainable growth of the economy. In this situation, the Bank Board repeated that the Czech National Bank would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2016."
Euroarea,2014-11-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with our forward guidance, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Following up on the decisions of 2 October 2014, we last month started purchasing covered bonds under our new programme. Together with the series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations to be conducted until June 2016, these asset purchases will have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet, which is expected to move towards the dimensions it had at the beginning of 2012. Our measures will enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, support financing conditions in the euro area, facilitate credit provision to the real economy and generate positive spillovers to other markets. They will thereby further ease the monetary policy stance more broadly, support our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates and reinforce the fact that there are significant and increasing differences in the monetary policy cycle between major advanced economies. With the measures that have been put in place, monetary policy has responded to the outlook for low inflation, a weakening growth momentum and continued subdued monetary and credit dynamics. Our accommodative monetary policy stance will underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations, in line with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. As they work their way through to the economy, our monetary policy measures will together contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to our aim. However, looking ahead, and taking into account new information and analysis, the Governing Council will closely monitor and continuously assess the appropriateness of its monetary policy stance. Should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation, the Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate. The Governing Council has tasked ECB staff and the relevant Eurosystem committees with ensuring the timely preparation of further measures to be implemented, if needed. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of this year, revised up as compared with the earlier estimate. Since the summer months, incoming data and survey evidence have overall indicated a weakening in the euro area's growth momentum. This information has now been incorporated into the most recent forecasts by private and public institutions, which indicate a downward revision of real GDP growth over the projection horizon up to 2016, with the outlook for a modest economic recovery remaining in place. This picture is broadly in line with the Governing Council's current assessment. On the one hand, domestic demand should be supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing improvements in financial conditions, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, and lower energy prices supporting real disposable income. Furthermore, demand for exports should benefit from the global recovery. On the other hand, the recovery is likely to continue to be dampened by high unemployment, sizeable unutilised capacity, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. In particular, the weakening in the euro area's growth momentum, alongside heightened geopolitical risks, could dampen confidence and, in particular, private investment. In addition, insufficient progress in structural reforms in euro area countries constitutes a key downward risk to the economic outlook. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.4% in October 2014, after 0.3% in September. Compared with the previous month, this mainly reflects a somewhat less negative contribution from energy prices and slightly stronger annual increases in food prices. A fall in industrial goods prices was partly compensated for by an increase in services price inflation. On the basis of current information and prevailing futures prices for energy, annual HICP inflation is expected to remain at around current low levels over the coming months, before increasing gradually during 2015 and 2016. This is also the picture portrayed by the most recent forecasts, which now incorporate the recent sharp fall in oil prices. The Governing Council will continue to closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. In this context, we will focus in particular on the possible repercussions of dampened growth dynamics, geopolitical developments, exchange rate and energy price developments, and the pass-through of our monetary policy measures. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for September 2014 continue to point to subdued underlying growth in broad money (M3), with the annual growth rate increasing moderately, however, to 2.5% in September, after 2.1% in August. Annual growth in M3 continues to be supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 6.2% in September. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained negative at -1.8% in September, after -2.0% in August and -2.2% in July. On average over recent months, net redemptions have moderated from the historically high levels recorded a year ago. Lending to non-financial corporations continues to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.6% in September, after 0.5% in August. In line with some stabilisation in credit flows, the October bank lending survey for the euro area reported a net easing of credit standards on loans to enterprises and households. At the same time, it has to be kept in mind that the level of credit standards is still tight from a historical perspective. Following the completion of the ECB's comprehensive assessment, a further strengthening of banks' balance sheets can be expected to contribute to reducing credit supply constraints and facilitating more lending. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirms the recent decisions taken by the Governing Council to provide further monetary policy accommodation and to support lending to the real economy. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. However, in order to strengthen investment activity, boost job creation and raise productivity growth, other policy areas need to contribute decisively. In particular, the legislation and implementation of product and labour market reforms as well as actions to improve the business environment for firms need to gain momentum in several countries. The effective implementation of structural reforms will raise expectations of higher incomes and encourage firms to increase investment today and bring forward the economic recovery. As regards fiscal policies, countries with remaining fiscal imbalances should not unravel the progress already made and should proceed in line with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. Throughout the procedural steps under the agreed framework, the Pact should remain the anchor for confidence in sustainable public finances. The existing flexibility within the rules should allow governments to address the budgetary costs of major structural reforms, to support demand and to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies. A full and consistent implementation of the euro area's existing fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance framework is key to bringing down high public debt ratios, to raising potential growth and to increasing the resilience of the euro area economy to shocks."
Malaysia,2014-11-06,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. The global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. Growth across the advanced economies has been uneven. In Asia, growth is being sustained by the continued expansion in domestic demand and exports. Looking ahead, while the overall global growth momentum is expected to improve, the growth forecast has been revised downwards due to weakening economic activity in a number of major economies. Consequently, the downside risks to global growth have increased. Volatility in the international financial markets has also risen. For Malaysia, while domestic demand has continued to support growth, exports have shown signs of moderation. Going forward, domestic demand will still remain the key driver of growth. Private consumption is expected to moderate, but investment activity is projected to remain robust, supported by broad-based capital spending by both the private and public sectors. While the moderating trends will affect the overall growth prospect, the Malaysian economy is still projected to remain on a steady growth path. Inflation is projected to trend higher for the remainder of the year and will continue to be above its long-term average next year due to domestic cost factors. However, the absence of external price pressures and more moderate demand conditions are expected to mitigate the impact of these cost factors on the underlying inflation. The current stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and is assessed to be appropriate given the developments in monetary and financial conditions. Moving forward, the MPC will continue to carefully assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. The MPC will also remain vigilant to the risks of destabilising financial imbalances. This is to ensure that the monetary policy stance is consistent with the sustainability of the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy. The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2015. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times during the year. The meetings will be held over two days, with the Monetary Policy Statement released at 6 p.m. on the second day of the MPC meeting. Schedule of Monetary Policy Committee Meetings for 2015. 27 and 28 January 2015 (Tuesday and Wednesday). 4 and 5 March 2015 (Wednesday and Thursday). 6 and 7 May 2015 (Wednesday and Thursday). 8 and 9 July 2015 (Wednesday and Thursday). 2 and 3 September 2015 (Wednesday and Thursday). 4 and 5 November 2015 (Wednesday and Thursday).

Armenia,2014-11-11,"Press Release 11.11.2014 Interest rate left unchanged, 6.75 percent In the November 11, 2014 Meeting, the Board of the CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of the CBA unchanged, 6.75 percent. There was 1.0 percent of inflation in October of 2014, compared to 0.3 percent of inflation recorded in the same month of the previous year. Approaching the lower border of the confidence band, the 12-month inflation amounted to 2.2 percent at the end of the month. In the coming months, the Board considers, the inflation rate will further near its target and stabilize around it. In the external sector, demand is still rebounding at a slow pace, so deflationary patterns are further observable in global commodity markets. However, the Board admits, uncertainties in connection with global economic outlook and growth perspectives in trade partners are persisting amid geopolitical developments. There was some revival in domestic economic activity starting from the third quarter of 2014, yet economic growth remains low. Despite a low demand in external and domestic sectors, the Board agrees that continued easing of monetary conditions and the expansionary fiscal policy so far implemented will in the near term lead to the expanding aggregate demand and rebounding inflation rates. Possibly, the latter would also be benefiting from stamp duty introduced to a range of products since October. As a result, in 2015 and the rest part of the forecast horizon the 12-month inflation will be near the target, varying around the confidence band. In the medium term, the Central Bank will react to economic developments in both external and domestic sectors by steering its monetary policy accordingly and making sure the inflation target is attained in the meantime. More information on setting of the interest rate will be available in the Central Bank's Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program Q4, 2014) due on November 21, 2014. Press Service of the Central Bank."
South Korea,2014-11-13,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.00% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.00% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that, although the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained, the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area has continued while trends of economic growth in emerging market countries have differed from country to country. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary policies of major countries, by the prolongation of economic sluggishness in the euro area, by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries, and by geopolitical risks. In Korea, the Committee judges that exports have sustained a favorable pattern, that indicators of domestic demand have been alternating between improvements and worsening, and that economic agents' sentiments have been sluggish. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has expanded steadily, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will gradually narrow going forward, albeit at a moderate pace. Consumer price inflation rose from 1.1% the month before to 1.2% in October, due mainly to a narrowing of the extent of decline in agricultural product prices. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell to 1.8%, from 1.9% in September, owing primarily to slowdowns in the rates of industrial product price increase. The Committee forecasts that, after remaining low for the time being, inflation will gradually rise next year. In the housing market, sales and leasehold deposit prices in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and in the rest of the country continued their uptrends. In the domestic financial markets, the Korean won has depreciated considerably against the US dollar but appreciated significantly against the Japanese yen, in line with the US dollar's strength globally and with the Japanese yen's weakness due mainly to the expansion of the Bank of Japan's quantitative and qualitative monetary easing. Stock prices have rebounded, after having fallen significantly due for example to concerns about the slowdown of the global economy and to outflows of foreigners' securities investment funds. Long-term interest rates have declined. Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as shifts in major countries' monetary policies, as well as the trends of household debt and of capital flows."
Peru,2014-11-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR NOVEMBER 2014 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 3.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.50 percent. This level of the benchmark rate is compatible with the forecast that inflation will be converging to 2.0 percent target in 2015. This forecast takes into account that: current and advanced indicators of economic activity continue showing a pace of growth below the potential level of growth; inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range, and recent international indicators show mixed signals of global economic recovery, as well as increased volatility in financial and exchange markets. Inflation in October showed a rate of 0.38 percent, as a result of which inflation in the last 12 months rose from 2.74 percent in September to 3.09 percent in October due to transitory supply factors. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.12 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation fell from 2.57 percent in September to 2.56 percent in October. Current and advanced indicators of activity continue to show a weak economic cycle, with lower GDP growth rates than the ones of the potential output. In November, the BCRP has continued lowering the reserve requirement rate in domestic currency from 10.5 to 10.0 percent with the aim of supporting the growth of credit in soles. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, and will implement additional monetary easing measures if it is necessary. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 2.30 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.30 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.30 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for December on December 11, 2014."
Pakistan,2014-11-15,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Decision 15th November 2014 Limited impact of floods and favorable trend in global commodity prices are the major highlights of the post-September monetary policy decision. Indeed CPI inflation (YoY) in October 2014 has come down sharply to. percent. This decline is explained by: smooth food supplies, which contained the price of perishable items; falling administered prices, which incorporate the fall in international commodity prices, especially oil; low inflation expectations, as witnessed by IBA-SBP consumer confidence surveys; and significant base effect. These developments bode well for the outlook of other macroeconomic variables in general. Given its recent downward trend, the likelihood for inflation to end the current fiscal year on lower plateau is high. But there are risks. First downward trend over the medium to long term remains to be seen because it is based on volatile prices of “perishable items” and “oil”. Second other risks identified in the previous statement, such as cut in subsidy to electricity and levying of Gas Infrastructure Development Cess, still hold and if materialized can alter the inflation outlook on higher side. Third underlying inflationary pressures on core inflation remain. The current low oil price could salvage some of the lost growth momentum. Broadly however, growth in Large-scale manufacturing would remain constrained due to energy bottlenecks. Thus the main thrust to the growth momentum would come from agriculture outcomes in the remaining months of FY15. Barring the limited flood-related damage to some kharif crops, agriculture output is expected to perform better than the previous year especially now when incentive for Rabbi season crops has been announced; such as, the recent increase of Rs100 in wheat support price. Government has shown significant progress in curtailing budgetary imbalances. It seems on course to achieve further fiscal consolidation, given its current management of expenditures and borrowing pattern. This has positive implications for the monetary management of the SBP and more importantly, in the coming months, it would have favorable impact on the private sector credit cycle. However to achieve fiscal consolidation in the long run, structural reforms to broaden the tax base remain imperative. Low oil price along with falling inflation can improve competitiveness of Pakistani exports. Imports on the other hand, might take advantage of low global commodity prices and increase further in the rest of FY15. This at the same time, given the significant imports intensity for exports sector in Pakistan, could add to exports competitiveness and improve its outlook towards the end of the current fiscal year. In the mean time, current slowdown in exports is further challenged by falling international cotton prices and stiff competition in low value- Page STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN added textile products in an environment of weak global demand. Thus trade deficit is expected to remain under pressure and the healthy growth in workers' remittances would continue to assuage the weaknesses in current account deficit, to some extent. It is also important to note the role of foreign exchange inflows in domestic liquidity creation and helping the banks to extend more credit to the private sector. This happens as government gets the space to borrow less from the banks, thereby leaving more liquidity with the banks for credit expansion. In response to various recent and ongoing efforts of the government, foreign exchange inflows would remain on track. Based on these considerations, the Board of Directors. State Bank of Pakistan, has decided to reduce the policy rate by 50 basis points to. percent with effect from 17 November 2014. Page."
Chile,2014-11-18,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 18 November 2014 Press Release1 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3% (annual). Internationally, recent information confirms the outlook of good economic performance in the United States and slower growth and low inflation in the Eurozone and Japan, a development that has widened the differences in the monetary policy implemented by those economies. External financial conditions tended to normalize during the month, but new outbreaks of volatility cannot be ruled out. Growth forecasts for emerging Asia have been revised down slightly, while for Latin America weak performance is confirmed in the larger part of the region. The price of oil dropped again, while the price of copper has been fairly stable. Output, demand, and employment indicators continue to reveal the low dynamism of the Chilean economy. Local financial conditions reflect the impact of the monetary stimulus. October's inflation was significantly higher than expected, at 5.7% y-o-y. The most likely scenario assumes that inflation will stay above the upper bound of the tolerance range still for some months. This surprise in inflation may be linked primarily to one-off temporary factors. The evolution of prices will continue to be monitored with special attention. Medium-term inflation expectations have remained around 3%. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. 1 The Spanish original prevails."
Georgia,2014-11-19,"19.11.14 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate unchanged at 4.00%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on November 19, 2014 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 4 percent. Inflation forecast has been revised downward as new information had been released since the previous MPC meeting. This was mostly related to the processes taking place in the region and in trade partners of Georgia as well as price decrease on world commodity markets. Therefore, in order to meet the inflation target the committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this stage. Despite the lower inflation forecast, in the medium term the gradual exit out of accommodative monetary policy is still necessary. According to the updated forecasts the inflation will reach its target value by the end of 2015. The annual inflation in October was 3.4%. According to preliminary estimates the real GDP grew by 5.5% in the third quarter and the preliminary data on the GDP growth in the first three quarters of the year are consistent with the forecasts. The output gap is negative, although it has decreasing trend. The recovery of the domestic demand is also evident from the increase in imports. Importantly, the credit activity keeps growing, with a significant increase in business loans. As for the external demand, it's still decreasing. According to preliminary data the export dropped by 5.2% in October. Given the worsening situation in the economies of the region, the external demand remains the main risk-factor. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure price stability. The dynamics of further changes in monetary policy will depend on the dynamics of expected inflation, tendencies in economic growth, global and regional economic environment. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on December 17, 2014."
Turkiye,2014-11-20,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 11.25 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.5 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 8.25 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.75 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. Global demand remains weak, while the contribution of domestic demand to growth is increasing. However, the moderate course of consumer loans and the favorable terms of trade may contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. Macroprudential measures taken at the beginning of the year and the tight monetary policy stance continue to have a favorable impact on the core inflation trend. However, elevated food prices delay the improvement in the inflation outlook. Meanwhile, current levels of commodity prices, in particular declining oil prices, are expected to contribute to disinflation foreseen for the next year. The Committee anticipates that, under the current monetary policy stance, inflation will decline in line with the forecast presented in the Inflation Report throughout 2015. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2014-11-20,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 20 November 2014 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the sharp decline in international oil prices has contributed to a more benign global inflation environment. This development may also ameliorate the deteriorating growth outlook in some regions by providing a boost to consumption expenditure. Lower oil prices have also had a favourable impact on domestic headline inflation, with the medium-term forecast improving relative to the previous forecast. However, the underlying inflation pressures, as reflected in core inflation, persist. The domestic growth outlook remains challenging, but after two quarters dominated by the fall-out from extended strikes, some recovery is expected, but demand remains subdued. The coming quarters are expected to see an improved performance in the mining and manufacturing sectors, but the outlook is inhibited by domestic structural constraints, as well as by a weak global economy and the continued declining trend in non-oil commodity prices. Growth next year is expected to remain weak. 1 The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 5,9 per cent in both September and October, having measured 6,4 per cent in August. Downward pressure on inflation in October came from continued moderation in food and petrol prices. Food price inflation continued its downward trend, measuring 8,0 per cent in October, down from 8,7 per cent previously, while petrol prices increased by 2,4 per cent. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, moderated to 5,6 per cent in September from 5,8 per cent in August, but measured 5,7 in October, reflecting primarily continued exchange rate pass-through to some goods categories. Administered price inflation excluding petrol measured 6,4 per cent in October, down from 6,5 per cent in September. Headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods, which reached a recent high of 8,8 per cent in April, measured 7,2 per cent and 6,9 per cent in August and September respectively, driven in part by lower food and fuel price inflation. The Bank's forecast of headline inflation has improved since the previous meeting of the MPC, mainly due to the impact of declining international oil prices. Having reached a peak of 6,5 per cent in the second quarter of this year, inflation is now expected to average 5,9 per cent in the final quarter of 2014, and average 6,1 per cent for the year, compared with 6,2 per cent previously. The downward trend is expected to continue into next year, with inflation forecast to reach a low of 5,1 per cent in the second quarter, and to average 5,3 per cent for the year, compared with 2. The downward trend is expected to continue into next year, with inflation forecast to reach a low of 5,1 per cent in the second quarter, and to average 5,3 per cent for the year, compared with 2 5,7 per cent previously. The forecast for 2016 has been revised down from 5,8 per cent to 5,5 per cent, and is expected to measure 5,4 per cent in the final quarter of the year. The forecast for core inflation, by contrast, is more or less unchanged at an average 5,6 per cent and 5,7 per cent in 2014 and 2015 respectively, reaching a peak of 5,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2015 (previously 5,8 per cent), and moderating to 5,3 per cent in 2016, down from 5,5 per cent previously. The MPC assesses the risk to the headline inflation forecast to be broadly balanced. The results of the fourth quarter inflation expectations survey of the BER will only be released in December. Market-based surveys, as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey, however, show that the median CPI inflation expectation of analysts has remained unchanged over the past two months at 5,7 per cent and 5,5 per cent for 2015 and 2016 respectively. Break-even inflation rates (the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation linked bonds) declined since the previous meeting and reflect expectations within the target range for 5 year maturities, and marginally above the upper limit of the inflation target range at 10 year maturities. The US and the UK remain the main drivers of global growth although more broadly, global growth may get some impetus from lower oil and food prices, which should provide some boost to consumers. US economic growth was better than expected in the third quarter, with the first advanced estimate of 3,5 per cent, and the unemployment rate declining to 5,8 per cent, the lowest level since June 2008. The UK recorded growth of 2,8 per cent in the third quarter, while the unemployment rate 3. The UK recorded growth of 2,8 per cent in the third quarter, while the unemployment rate 3 was unchanged at 6,0 per cent. The Japanese economy contracted for a second consecutive quarter during the third quarter, and has prompted a reconsideration of a further VAT increase next year. The response to the further additional monetary stimulus announced recently remains uncertain amid a tighter fiscal policy stance. The Eurozone outlook also remains bleak, including in the core countries such as France and Germany, although lower food and oil prices, coupled with further monetary easing may have a positive impact. The outlook for emerging markets is mixed, with emerging Asian economies expected to benefit most from the positive spillovers from the US recovery. This is expected to offset in part the adverse impact of the slowdown in China, where growth is expected to be lower than in the past few years, as the economy rebalances away from investment towards consumption. This moderation is expected to continue to impact negatively on commodity prices. The Indian economy is showing signs of sustained recovery, while the other Brics partners. Russia and Brazil, face significant growth headwinds. Oil exporters generally are expected to face challenges from international oil price weakness. Global inflation is expected to moderate in the face of benign food price inflation and falling international oil and other commodity prices. While this is welcome in the higher inflation regions, particularly emerging markets, it does aggravate deflationary risks in some of the advanced economies, particularly in the Eurozone and Japan. Monetary policy stances are expected to remain ultra-loose in these two regions, with a significant stimulus package announced recently in Japan and the ECB is anticipated to conduct further asset purchases. The US Fed has ended its programme of quantitative easing, but at this stage it is not contracting its balance 4. The US Fed has ended its programme of quantitative easing, but at this stage it is not contracting its balance 4 sheet and proceeds from maturing assets are being reinvested. Although the general expectation is that the US Fed will begin raising interest rates in mid-2015, there are also some expectations that the more benign inflation outlook could delay this. Forward guidance from both the Bank of England and the US Fed is that any adjustment is likely to be gradual, and policy rates may be lower than their estimated long run normal rates for some time despite the improved growth outlooks. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, policy rates have increased in Brazil. Russia and Indonesia, but reduced in Sweden. South Korea. Chile and Poland. The exchange rate of the rand has been relatively volatile since the previous meeting, in response to external and domestic factors including changing expectations of the timing of the first US interest rate increase as well as the downgrade of South Africa's credit rating by Moody's Investor Service. Although the rand initially weakened sharply against the US dollar, at one stage reaching a level of R11,36 against the US dollar, this move has since largely been reversed. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has depreciated marginally against the US dollar, but appreciated by 2,1 per cent and 3,5 per cent against the euro and sterling respectively, and by 1,8 per cent on a trade weighted basis. The rand is expected to remain susceptible to sudden shifts in sentiment regarding changes in monetary policy stances in the advanced economies, and the continued uncertainty regarding the extent to which US normalisation is already priced in to the exchange rate. The asynchronous nature of advanced economy monetary policies is expected to complicate the outlook and outcomes. However, the rand is likely to remain more sensitive to changes in financial conditions in the US than in Japan and the Eurozone. The persistently slow adjustment of the current account deficit also 5. The persistently slow adjustment of the current account deficit also 5 makes the rand vulnerable to swings in sentiment that raise concerns about the financing of this deficit. Although the lower oil prices should reduce the oil import bill, its positive impact on the deficit may be limited by further declines in other commodity prices. The volatility in portfolio capital flows is indicative of fickle global investor sentiment. Net bond sales by non-residents amounted to R12,6 bn in September and R2,1 bn in October and a further R1,5 bn to date in November. In the equities market, having been marginal net sellers in September, non-residents were net buyers to the value of R5,7 bn in October but net sellers of R6,3 bn to date. The domestic growth outlook remains subdued. Although an improved growth outcome is expected in the third quarter, following the 0,6 per cent growth in the second quarter, this is off a low base following prolonged strikes in the mining and manufacturing sectors. The Bank's forecast for GDP growth in 2014 has declined marginally from 1,5 per cent to 1,4 per cent, and forecasts for 2015 and 2016 have been revised down from 2,8 per cent and 3,1 per cent to 2,5 per cent and 2,9 per cent respectively. This restrained outlook is consistent with the Bank's composite leading indicator of economic activity which continues to trend sideways, with a slight upward move recently. The RMB/BER business confidence index improved in the third quarter, but at 46 index points, remains below the neutral level of 50. The mining sector appears to be recovering to some extent from the strike-affected first half of the year, and is expected to contribute positively to third quarter growth, following two consecutive quarters of contraction. The physical volume of mining production increased by 0,7 per cent in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, and further increases can be expected in the final quarter, as platinum 6. The physical volume of mining production increased by 0,7 per cent in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, and further increases can be expected in the final quarter, as platinum 6 output is still below pre-strike levels. By contrast, although the physical volume of manufacturing production increased in September, the month-long strike in the steel and engineering industry in July contributed to a quarter-to-quarter contraction of 1,3 per cent in the third quarter. Sentiment indicators suggest that the outlook for the sector remains bleak, with the manufacturing confidence index still at very low levels and capacity utilisation rates back at 2011 levels. More positively, the Kagiso PMI edged above 50 index points in October for the first time since March, driven mainly by the inventory and new sales orders sub-indices. The outlook for the construction sector is more positive, with the real value of building plans passed increasing for the fourth successive month in August. On a three-month-to-three-month basis, an increase of 9,8 per cent was recorded. However, while the various building confidence indices have generally improved, they remain below the neutral level. The weak pace of economic growth is mirrored in the unemployment rate, which, according to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey of Statistics South Africa measured 25,4 per cent in the third quarter, compared with 24,5 per cent a year earlier. Total employment increased at a year-on-year rate of 0,5 per cent in the quarter. At the same time the number of discouraged workers increased sharply, by almost 100,000, and now total 2,5 million. Consumption expenditure by households has remained relatively subdued, but there are signs of a moderate increase in the quarterly growth rate, as the negative effects of the protracted strikes on consumption dissipate. Consumption expenditure could be positively impacted by lower petrol prices. Although retail sales growth declined by 0,8 per cent (non annualised) in September, quarter-to-quarter growth of 0,9 per 7. Although retail sales growth declined by 0,8 per cent (non annualised) in September, quarter-to-quarter growth of 0,9 per 7 cent was recorded in the third quarter, and 2,3 per cent year-on-year. Similarly, wholesale trade sales contracted in the third quarter, but increased by 5,9 per cent on a year-on-year basis. Motor vehicle sales have also shown some signs of recovery, although domestic sales are expected to be lower this year than in 2013. Retail sector confidence improved, with the BER reporting retailer confidence above the neutral level for the first time in two and a half years. Consumer confidence, however, declined significantly in the third quarter following an unexpected increase in the second quarter. Trends in bank credit extension to the private sector have remained characterised by declining growth in advances to households, while advances to corporates have been buoyant. Total loans and advances grew at a twelve month rate of 8,8 per cent in September, but excluding mortgages the growth rate was 13,5 per cent, compared with a recent high of 18,6 per cent in December 2012. Credit extension to the household sector grew by 3,7 per cent in September, as unsecured lending remained weak despite a reversal of the negative growth trend in the month, but credit to the corporate sector grew by 15,3 per cent. Twelve-month growth in mortgage advances to households remained at levels below 3 per cent, while instalment sale credit and leasing finance continued its downward trend, with growth of 6,9 per cent. These trends are likely to constrain consumer demand in the coming months. According to the October Medium Term Budget Policy Statement, government remains committed to its policy of fiscal consolidation, in order to prevent an increase in the debt ratio to unsustainable levels. The fiscal deficit is expected to decline from a projected 4,7 per cent of GDP in the current fiscal year to 3,0 per cent in 2017/18. 8 This is expected to be achieved through adherence to a nominal expenditure growth ceiling, and increased tax revenues. The ability to achieve the nominal expenditure targets will be determined to an important degree by the public sector wage settlement. Wage trends remain broadly unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC. According to Andrew Levy Employment publications, wage settlement rates averaged 8,0 per cent in the first nine months of the year. Nominal remuneration per worker as well as productivity trends in the formal non-agricultural sector were distorted by the significant increase in temporary employees by the Independent Electoral Commission, which contributed to the decline in the year-on-year increase in remuneration from 6,3 per cent to 3,5 per cent, while productivity declined by 1,6 per cent. The net result was a marginal increase in unit labour costs of 5,2 per cent in the second quarter, from 5,1 per cent previously. Food price inflation remains a major driver of inflation, but is expected to continue to moderate in the coming months. Food price inflation appears to have peaked at 9,5 per cent in August, and has since moderated to 8,0 per cent in October, as lower producer prices of crops and cereals, which declined by 6,3 per cent in September, are beginning to have an impact at the consumer price level. Restocking of herds following the drought last year, however, has kept meat price inflation elevated. Food price pressures also remain benign at the global level, with the Food and Agricultural Organisation international food price index declining for seven consecutive months to its lowest level since August 2010. International oil prices have declined markedly since their recent peak in June of around US$115 per barrel to current levels of below US$80 per barrel. This decline 9 reflects a combination of factors, including increased supply coming from the US and Libya, moderating demand from China in particular, and changes in the internal dynamics within the OPEC cartel. The general expectation in the market is that these lower prices could persist for some time. Although some of the advantage of lower international oil prices has been offset to some extent by a weaker rand exchange rate, domestic petrol prices have declined by a cumulative R1,17 per litre since August, and should current trends continue, a further decline of around 70 cents per litre can be expected in December. The marked decline in international oil prices has had a significant impact on the medium term outlook for headline inflation in the global economy and in South Africa. At this stage it is unclear whether this is a temporary shock, or if it will be sustained or decline further. As with an oil price increase, we would look through the impact effect and focus on the possible second round effects of this decline. The possibility that oil prices are sustained at current levels introduces a degree of downside risk to the inflation forecast. The domestic growth outlook remains challenging, and the risks to the forecast are assessed to be moderately on the downside. The MPC does not see significant signs of excess demand pressures that are impacting on the inflation outlook and household consumption expenditure is expected to remain constrained. At the same time, despite its recent relative stability, the exchange rate remains an upside risk to the inflation outlook, vulnerable to changing perceptions of the timing of global monetary policy adjustments, and the slow pace of contraction in the current account deficit. The extent to which policy normalisation is already priced into the exchange rate is also unclear. 10 A further upside risk to the inflation forecast comes from a possible increase in wage settlement rates in excess of inflation and productivity growth in the coming year. In light of this assessment, the MPC sees the overall risk to the headline inflation forecast to be more or less balanced. However, given the elevated level of core inflation, and the fact that headline inflation is expected to increase later in the forecast period as the first round effect of the oil price decline dissipates, the Committee remains vigilant and will continue to monitor developments closely. The Committee remains of the view that interest rates will have to normalise over time. However, given the lower trajectory of headline inflation and the continued weak state of the economy, the MPC has unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,75 per cent per annum at this stage. The timing of future interest rate increases will be dependent on a range of factors, including the evolution of inflation expectations, the speed of normalisation of monetary policy in the US and the state of the domestic economy.

Israel,2014-11-24,"The CPI for October increased by 0.3 percent, led by an increase of 0.7 percent in prices of tradable goods. The rate of inflation as measured over the previous 12 months remained at negative 0.3 percent. This month, the decline continued in short-term and medium-term inflation expectations, which apparently incorporate the expected one-off effect of a reduction in electricity and water prices in January. The first estimate of National Accounts data for the third quarter indicates negative growth in GDP, as a result of Operation Protective Edge. This primarily reflects a sharp decline in investment and a continued decline in exports, while private consumption continued to increase. Indicators which became available after Operation Protective Edge, relating to goods exports, industrial production, trade and services revenues, and indirect tax revenues point to a recovery in activity, to the moderate growth level of just before the conflict. The shekel weakened by 1.1 percent againstthe dollar this month, and appreciated by 0.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Since the beginning of August, when a trend ofdepreciation in the effective exchange rate began, the shekel has weakenedby 7.1 percent, and it has depreciated by about 3.9 percent since the beginning of the year. Continued depreciation will support a recovery in exports and in the tradable sector as a whole, and is expected to contribute to returning the inflation rate to within the target range. Recent months' trends continued in the global economy this month: growth in the US, and continued weakness in Europe. Japan and most emerging markets. In the US, a quantitative easing program concluded, in Japan the program was expanded, and in Europe, the operations are expected to be expanded soon. The decline in oil prices is expected to contribute toa decline in global inflation, but will support economic recovery. The decline in the number of housing market transactions continues, with an increase in sales of new homes in recent months, and a moderation in the rate of mortgages being taken out. Home prices declined by 0.1 percent in August-September, and their rate of increase over the 12 months ending inAugust slowed to 4.7 percent. Uncertainty continues regarding policy measures in the housing market and their ramifications. In recent months, there have been net new investments by the public in general bond mutual funds and withdrawals from corporate bond funds. Corporate bond market spreads remain low. Background conditions. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the effects of the recent interest rate reductions, which brought the interest rate to a level of 0.25 percent, have not yet been fully reflected in activity and in inflation, and in light of that decided to keep the interest rate unchanged this monthas well. Inflation data: The Consumer PriceIndex (CPI) for October increased by 0.3 percent, slightly above forecasters' projections for an increase of 0.2 percent, on average. There were marked increases in the clothing and footwear, food, and fruit and vegetables components, and no component declined this month. The inflation rateover the preceding 12 months was negative 0.3 percent, similar to the figure for the 12 months ended in September. The tradable goods components of the CPI increased by 0.7 percent this month, and their rate of decline over the past 12 months slowed to 1.8 percent, compared with 2.5 percent in the 12 months ended in September. That decline in tradable goods prices came against the background of the sharp decline: greater than 20 percent: in the past two years in prices of various commodities worldwide, and against the background of the extended shekel appreciation. To date, these developments have not been offset by the shekel depreciation since August. Index components representing nontradable products increased by 0.2 percent this month; their rate of increase over the previous 12 months continued to decline, reaching 0.6 percent, compared with 0.8 percent in the 12 months ending in September. Inflation and interest rate forecasts:One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market (seasonally adjusted) declined sharply, from 0.6 percent to 0.3 percent, and expectations for two years also declined, from 1.0 percent to 0.7 percent. Private forecasters' projections for the next 12 CPI readings declined from 0.9 percent to 0.7 percent, on average. Expectations for the coming 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates declined from 0.5 percent to 0.4 percent. The expectations apparently incorporate the one-off effect of reductions in water and electricity prices expected in January, which will lower the CPI by 0.5 percent. Expectations for medium terms continued to decline this month, by about 0.1 percentage points, whileexpectations for longer terms did not change markedly. According to private forecasters' projections, and data derived from the makam and Telbor curves, the probability of an additional reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate is lower than it was just before the previous interest rate decision. Real economic activity: Indicatorsthat became available this month point to a recovery in economic activity after Operation Protective Edge, to the level of moderate growth just before the conflict. According to the first estimate of third quarter National Accounts data (seasonally adjusted, annual terms). GDP declined by 0.4 percent, and business sector product declined 1.4 percent, in the quarter, against the background of Operation Protective Edge. The contraction in GDP was led by a decline of 4.4 percent in exports (excluding diamonds and start-upcompanies), which includes a decline of 77 percent in exports of tourism services and a decline of 8.1 percent in fixed capital formation (excluding ships and aircraft). The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.1 percent in October, similar to its monthly rate of growth since the beginning of the year. The index was primarily impacted on positively by increases in the Industrial Production index and indices of trade and services revenue for September. Goods exports (excluding ships and aircraft and diamonds) increased by 1.9 percent in October, compared with September (in dollar terms; due to the strengthening of the dollar worldwide it may be assumedthat the quantity increase was greater). This followed an increase in September, and a decline in August against the background of the security situation. Goods imports (excluding ships and aircraft and fuels) declined by 1.6 percent in October, continuing a decline in September. Services exports in August were negatively impacted by the tourism component, though the export of other business services (excluding startups) remained unchanged at the peak levels they reached in March. The expectations component in the Bankof Israel's Companies Survey for the third quarter forecasts that activity in the fourth quarter will be similar to that of the first and second quarters. The business sector Climate Index, based on the Business Tendency Survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics for October, indicates a monthly growth rate of 0.2 percent, which is an improvement compared with previous months, though the figure remains lower than the rate of before the summer. Consumer confidence indices compiled by Bank Hapoalim and the Central Bureau of Statistics declined this month, and Bank Hapoalim's Purchasing Managers Index declined by 1.6 percentage points to 48.3 points, below the level that distinguishes between contraction and expansion. The labor market: Labor Force Survey data for the third quarter indicate a decline from the record levels of the second quarter, but the level of employment remains high. Among the principal working ages (25-64), the unemployment rate remained unchanged, at 5.3 percent; the labor force participation rate declined by 0.2 percentage points to 79.3 percent, and the employment rate declined by 0.2 percentage points as well, to 75.1 percent. The overall unemployment rate increased by 0.3 percentage points to 6.4 percent. Labor Force Survey data for October indicate a marked improvement in employment, and a decline in unemployment. Against the background of the security situation, there was a decline of 0.6 percent in the number of employee posts in August, further to thedecline in July. Nominal wages increased in June-August by 0.8 percent, and real wages increased by 0.6 percent, compared to March-May (seasonally adjusted data). Health tax receipts continued to increase at a stable rate, with receipts in September-October 5.5 percent higher (in nominal terms) than the corresponding period last year. Budget data: In JanuaryC 2AD-October, the deficit in the government's domestic activity (excluding net credit) totaled about NIS 8.5 billion. This is about NIS 4.9 billion smaller than the deficit in the seasonal path consistent with meeting the 2014 deficit target, as expenditure has been lower than the seasonal path consistent with full budget performance. Total domestic expenditures (excluding credit) were NIS 6.4 billion lower in January-October than the expenditure consistent with the seasonal path. With that, expenditureis expected to increase beyond the seasonal path at the end of the year. Domestic revenues from the beginning of the year are about NIS 1.5 billion lower than the seasonal path consistent with the budget forecast. Based on trend data, there was some acceleration in VAT receipts on gross domestic activity: an indicator of private consumption: in recent months. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on October 26, 2014, through November 21, 2014, the shekel weakened by 1.05 percent against the dollar, and by 0.3 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel appreciated by 0.2 percent. For the year to date, the shekel has weakened by about 3.9 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on October 26, 2014, through November 21, 2014, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 0.5 percent, a smaller increase than the worldwide trend. Government bond yields increased, as yields on the unindexed bond yield curve increased by about 5 basis points for short terms, and by about 10 basis points for longer terms. On the CPI-indexed curve, yields increased by an average of about 12 basis points. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and corresponding 10-year US Treasury securities remained virtually unchanged, at a negative level of about 18 basis points, with yields on unindexed 10-year bonds increasing by 8 basis points to about 2.13 percent. There were slight changes in makam yields along the entire curve, and the 1-year yield is 0.19 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread remained virtually unchanged at 83 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in October, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 30.7 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 8.6 percent. The credit market: Total outstanding debt of the business sector increased by about NIS 13 billion (1.7 percent) in September, to NIS 794 billion. The increase derived partly from a depreciation of the shekel against the dollar, which increased the shekel value of debt indexed to and denominated in foreign currency, though it also reflects net debt raised of about NIS 6 billion. In October, the nonfinancial business sector issued only about NIS 0.6 billion in bonds, compared witha monthly average of NIS 3.6 billion since the beginning of the year. Corporate bondmarket spreads remain low. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 2.9 billion (0.7 percent) in September, to about NIS 428 billion. Outstanding housing debt increased by about NIS 1 billion. In October, the decline in the volume of new mortgages taken out continued, in view of the holiday period, among other things. New mortgages taken out totaled about NIS 3.5 billion, compared with a monthly average of about NIS 4.3 billion since the beginning of the year. The interest rate on new mortgages taken out remained virtually unchanged in October on the unindexed, variable-rate, track, while on other tracks it continued to decline: by 0.07 percentage points on the CPI-indexed, fixed rate track, and by 0.13 percentage points onthe CPI-indexed, variable rate and unindexed fixed-rate tracks. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.2 percent inOctober, after remaining unchanged the previous month. In the 12 months that ended in October, this component increased by 2.2 percent. Home prices, which are measured in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, declined by 0.1 percent in August-September. The annual rate of increase in prices continued to moderate, with home prices increasing by 4.7 percent over the 12 months ending in September, compared with an increase of 5.3 percent in the 12 months ended in August. The number of transactions in the housing market continues to decline, although at a more moderate rate than in previous months, and there wasa sharp increase in purchases of new homes in September. There was no change in the number of new homes available for sale. The global economy: Recent months' trends continued in the global economy this month: growth in the US, and weakness in Europe. Japan and most emerging markets. In the US. GDP grew by 3.5 percent in the third quarter (in annual terms), led by an increase of 7.8 percent in exports, though personal consumption expenditures increased at a rate of just 1.8 percent. The strengthening of the dollar is liable to negatively impact the pace of the recovery in exports further on. Labor market improvement continues, and was reflected in the addition of 214,000 jobs in October and a decline in the unemployment rate to 5.8 percent. Consumer confidence indices increased to their highest levels since the global crisis. The Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program ended, and in its announcement, the Federal Reserve noted that the weakness in the employment market is gradually diminishing. In Europe, there was growth of 0.2 percent in the third quarter (in quarterly terms), with growth of just 0.1 percent in Germany. The weighted Eurozone purchasing managers' index increased slightly, but is still below the 50-point threshold. The results of stress tests at European banks indicated that about one-fifth of the banks examined will need to present plans to improve their capital, which will limit their ability to increase credit. Inflation remains low, and against this background, the president of the ECB said that the members of its Governing Council are unanimous in their readiness to use unconventional instruments to deal with the risk of deflation. The ECB's announcement this month included quantitative targets regarding the effects of the special operations on the size of the central bank's balance sheet. In the UK, data indicate moderation of growth, and the date on which the Monetary Policy Committee projects to begin increasing the interest rate has been delayed to the second half of 2015. In Japan, there was negative growth of 1.6 percent in the third quarter (in annual terms, against the background of expectations for positive growth of more than 2 percent), further to the contraction in the second quarter, and the prime minister announced a delay in the additional VAT increase and that the elections would be brought forward. Even before the publication of the growth figures,the Bank of Japan decided to expand the extent of quantitative easing, anddeclared its intention to support an increase in inflation as much as necessary. In China, the decline in the pace of retail sales and in industrial production continued, and the inflation rate remained at a 4-year low whichit reached in the previous month: 1.6 percent. The central bank reduced the interest rate on loans for the first time since 2012. In India, the stable recovery continues under the new administration. In Brazil, the weakness continues, and in Russia, a slowdown continues against the background of the sanctions imposed on it and the decline in oil prices, which fell a further 7 percent this month. The price of a barrel of Brent Sea crude oil reached $77 this month. The decline in energy prices is expected to support a global economic recovery. The upward correction in agricultural commodity prices continued, and they increased by 4 percent. Stock markets rose worldwide this month. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for December 2014 unchanged at 0.25 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, whichis intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need touse various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for December 2014 will be published on December 8, 2014. The decision regarding the interest rate for January 2015 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. December 29, 2014."
Hungary,2014-11-25,"At its meeting on 25 November 2014, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 2.10%. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to continue. While the pace of economic activity is strengthening, output remains below potential and the domestic real economy is expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact, albeit to a diminishing extent. Despite the pick-up in domestic demand, capacity utilisation is expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungary's export markets. With employment rising, the unemployment rate continues to exceed its long-term level determined by structural factors. Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain moderate for an extended period. Based on the inflation data for October, consumer prices continue to show historically low dynamics. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation capturing the medium-term outlook still indicate moderate inflationary pressures in the economy, reflecting persistently low inflation in external markets, favourable developments in commodity prices and imported inflation, the degree of unused capacity in the economy, subdued wage dynamics, the fall in inflation expectations and the reductions in administered energy prices implemented in a series of steps. Domestic real economic and labour market factors continue to have a disinflationary impact and low inflation is likely to persist for a sustained period. However, domestic demand-side disinflationary pressures are weakening gradually as activity gathers pace, and inflation is likely to reach levels around 3 per cent consistent with price stability in the second half of the forecast period. In the Council's judgement, economic growth is likely to continue even as external demand has weakened slightly. The decline in industrial production in August was partly reversed in September, and the trade surplus rose again, following the decline in the previous month. According to the preliminary data, the dynamics of retail sales were stable in September. In the Council's judgement, economic growth may continue in a more balanced pattern than previously, with the recovery in domestic demand likely to make a greater contribution to growth. The increasing use of EU funding and the easing in credit constraints also due to the Bank's Funding for Growth Scheme are expected to sustain the recovery in investment. Household consumption is also likely to grow gradually, mainly as a result of the expected increase in the real value of disposable income and the reduced need for deleveraging. However, propensity to save is expected to remain above levels seen prior to the crisis. Employment increased in the third quarter, with a significant contribution from the rise in the number of those employed under public employment programmes. International investor sentiment has been mostly positive in the past month, mainly reflecting the release of buoyant macroeconomic data in the US, monetary easing by the Bank of Japan and the continued decline in the world market price of crude oil. Hungary's persistently high external financing capacity and the resulting decline in external debt have contributed to the reduction in its vulnerability. In the Council's judgement, a cautious approach to policy is warranted due to uncertainty about future developments in the global financial environment. In the Council's judgement, there remains a degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate in the medium term. The negative output gap is expected to close gradually at the monetary policy horizon. Looking ahead, therefore, the disinflationary impact of the real economy is likely to diminish and, with current monetary conditions maintained, inflation is likely to move into line with the target over the medium term. The Council judges that, based on available information, the current level of the central bank base rate is consistent with the medium-term achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support to the real economy. If the assumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, achieving the medium-term inflation target points in the direction of maintaining current loose monetary conditions for an extended period."
Egypt,2014-11-27,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release November 27, 2014 In its meeting held on November 27, 2014, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 925 percent, 1025 percent, and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 975 percen. Headline CPI inched up by 171 percent (m/m) in October 2014, following an increase of 123 percent (m/m) in Septembe. This brings the annual rate to 1184 percent in October, after recording 1112 percent in Septembe. The monthly developments in October came on the back of increases in public and private education fees, which usually coincide with the beginning of the school yea. In the meantime while prices of fresh vegetables inched-up, prices of other food items continued to decelerate supported by the decline in international prices, notwithstanding the seasonal pick-up in September due to Eid Al-Adh. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 055 percent (m/m) in October, compared to 084 percent (m/m) in Septembe. The annual rate eased to 847 percent in October from 915 percent in September, partly reflecting the decline in food prices and a favorable base effec. Upside risks from imported inflation continue to be contained on the back of lower international food price forecasts in light of global development. Meanwhile real GDP picked up significantly in 2013/2014 Q4, growing by 370 percent compared to 250 percent, 144 percent and 104 percent recorded in Q3. Q2 and Q1, respectivel. This brought the annual growth rate for the whole FY2013/2014 to 22 percent following a similarly sluggish growth rate of 21 percent during FY2012/201. The expansion in economic activity during 2013/2014 Q4 came on the back of the acceleration in manufacturing and real estate activities, along with a moderate growth in the construction secto. This occurred despite the continued contraction witnessed in the tourism and petroleum sector. In the meantime, investment continues to be below historical levels despite the relative improvement witnessed in the annual growth rate during 2013/2014 Q3 and Q4, following six quarters of contractio. Looking ahead, while investments in domestic mega projects such as the Suez Canal are expected to contribute to economic growth, the downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GD. At this juncture, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriate given the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlook. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Sub Governor.

India,2014-12-02,"Fifth Bi-Monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2014-15 By Dr.Raghuram G Rajan. Governor Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.0 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL); continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 7-day and 14-day term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily one-day term repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 9.0 per cent. Assessment of the Global Economy 2. Since the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement of September 2014, the global economy has slowed, though the recent sharp fall in crude prices will have a net positive impact on global growth. The recovery in the United States is broadening on the back of stronger domestic consumption, rising investment and industrial activity. In the Euro area, headwinds from recessionary forces continue to weaken industrial production and investment sentiment. In Japan, growth may be picking up again on the back of stronger exports, helped in part by further quantitative and qualitative easing that has led to a depreciation of the yen. In China, disappointing activity and still-low inflation have prompted rate cuts by the People's Bank of China. In other major emerging market economies (EMEs), downside risks to growth from elevated inflation, low commodity prices, deteriorating labour market conditions and stalling domestic demand have become accentuated. 12 of 2014-15, and activity is likely to be muted in Q3 also because of a moderate kharif harvest. The deficiency in the north- east monsoon rainfall has constrained the pace of rabi sowing, except in the southern States. Despite reasonable levels of water storage in major reservoirs, the rabi crop is unlikely to compensate for the decline in kharif production earlier in the year and consequently, agricultural growth in 2014-15 is likely to be muted. This, along with a slowdown in rural wage growth, is weighing on rural consumption demand. Despite the uptick in September, the growth of industrial production slumped to 1.1 per cent in Q2 with negative momentum in September, unable to sustain the improvement recorded in the preceding quarter. The persisting contraction in the production of both capital goods and consumer goods in Q2 reflected weak aggregate domestic demand. However, more recent readings of core sector activity, automobile sales and purchasing managers' indices suggest improvement in likely activity. Exports have buffered the slowdown in industrial activity in Q2 but, going forward, require support from partner country growth. In the services sector, the October's purchasing managers' survey indicates deceleration in new business. In contrast, tourist arrivals and domestic and international cargo movements have shown improvement. Thus, various constituents of the services sector are emitting mixed signals. A rise in investment is critical for a sustained pick-up in overall economic activity. While low capacity utilisation in some sectors is a dampener, the recent strong improvement in business confidence and in investment intentions should help. In this context, the still slow pace of reviving stalled projects, despite government efforts, warrants policy priority, even as ongoing efforts to ease stress in the financial system unlock resources for financing the envisaged investment push. The fiscal outlook should brighten because of the fall in crude prices, but weak tax revenue growth and the slow pace of disinvestment suggest some uncertainty about the likely achievement of fiscal targets, and the quality of eventual fiscal adjustment. The government, however, appears determined to stay on course. Retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), has decelerated sharply since the fourth bi-monthly statement of September. This reflects, to some extent, transitory factors such as favourable base effects and the usual softening of fruits and vegetable prices that occurs at this time of the year. On the other hand, protein-rich items such as milk and pulses continue to experience upside pressures, reflecting structural mismatches in supply and demand. The absence of adequate administered price revisions in inputs like electricity has contributed to the easing of inflation in the fuel group. In the non-food non-fuel category, inflation eased broadly in September. Further softening of international crude prices in October eased price pressures in 23 of 2014-15 due to structural and frictional factors, as well as the fine tuning of the liquidity adjustment framework. With deposit mobilisation outpacing credit growth and currency demand remaining subdued in relation to past trends, banks are flush with funds, leading a number of banks to reduce deposit rates. The main frictional source of liquidity has been the large release of expenditure/transfers by the government. In view of abundant liquidity, banks' recourse to the Reserve Bank for liquidity through net fixed and variable rate term and overnight repos and MSF declined from 803 billion, on average, in Q1 to 706 billion in Q2 and further to 476 billion in October- November. The use of export credit refinance also declined from 52.6 per cent of the limit in Q2 to 32.6 per cent in October-November. The revised liquidity management framework introduced in September, has helped the weighted average cut-off rates in the 14-day term repo auctions as well as in the overnight variable rate repo auctions to remain close to the repo rate, and the volatility of the weighted average call rate has fallen, apart from episodes of cash build-up ahead of Diwali holidays. The Reserve Bank determines the need for open market operations (OMO) based on its assessment of monetary conditions rather than on a specific view on long term yields. On an assessment of the permanent liquidity conditions, the Reserve Bank conducted OMO sales worth 401 billion during October to December so far. Merchandise exports declined in October, mainly reflecting sluggish external demand conditions, but also the softening of international prices resulting in lower realisations. For the period April-October as a whole, however, export growth remained positive although the deceleration since July requires vigilance. With import growth remaining modest on account of the decline in POL imports due to falling crude prices, the trade deficit narrowed from its level a year ago. Gold imports have surged since September in volume terms, largely reflecting seasonal demand. Barring month-to-month variations, non-oil non-gold import growth has remained moderate, with anecdotal evidence of imports substituting for shortfalls in domestic production. Even as external financing requirements stay moderate, all categories of capital flows, except non-resident deposits, have been buoyant. The consequent accretion to reserves denominated in US dollars has been moderated by valuation effects resulting from the strength of the US dollar. Policy Stance and Rationale 14. Consistent with the balance of risks set out in the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement of September, headline inflation has been receding steadily and current readings are below the January 2015 target of 8 per cent as well as the January 2016 target of 6 per cent. The inflation reading for November  which will 345 has been retained at 5.5 per cent, with a gradual pick-up in momentum through 2015-16 on the assumption of a normal monsoon and no adverse supply/financial shocks (Chart 2). The sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement is scheduled on Tuesday. February 3, 2015. Alpana Killawala Press Release: 2014-15/1124 Principal Chief General Manager 5."
Poland,2014-12-03,"Warsaw, 3 December 2014 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 2-3 December 2014 The Council has decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at:  reference rate at 2.00% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 3.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate at 2.25% on an annual basis. Global economic activity remains moderate, although the situation varies across countries. In the United States, economic growth in 2014 Q3 stayed relatively robust. In the euro area, in turn. GDP growth  notwithstanding slight acceleration  remained weak, and business climate indicators point to low activity growth probably continuing in the following quarters. This is accompanied by relatively slow GDP growth in the largest emerging economies, with a recent weakening observed in Russia and China. In the past month, oil prices continued to decline. Along with moderate global economic growth, this contributes to very low inflation in many countries. In Poland's immediate environment  including the euro area and the Central and Eastern Europe  inflation remains close to zero. Major central banks continue their expansionary monetary policy, with interest rates at historically low levels, while the ECB and the Bank of Japan run asset purchase programmes. In Poland, in 2014 Q3 annual GDP growth decreased to 3.3% y/y (from 3.5% in 2014 Q2). Stable growth in consumption was accompanied by some acceleration in investment growth. Alongside that, exports and imports growth slowed down. As a consequence, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth stayed negative. According to data for October, industrial production and retail sales growth remained weak, while construction and assembly output decreased. This was accompanied by a stable growth in bank lending to both enterprises and households. LFS data show an acceleration in the number of working persons in the economy in 2014 Q3, which was conducive to further reduction in the unemployment rate. At the same time, wage pressure remains limited, as indicated by continued moderate wage growth in the economy. In October. CPI inflation declined to -0.6% y/y. This was accompanied by a decrease in core inflation indices, which confirms the absence of demand pressure in the economy. The continued decline in producer prices points, in turn, to a lack of cost pressure. This is accompanied by very low inflation expectations of enterprises and households. In the opinion of the Council, the October adjustment of monetary policy and the stable, despite some slowdown, economic growth limit the risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term. Therefore, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. However, the Council highlights that uncertainty regarding the economic conditions in the environment of the Polish economy persists. If the incoming data confirm a slowdown in economic activity, and weak growth in the environment of the Polish economy persists, the Council does not rule out further adjustment of monetary policy."
Thailand,2014-12-03,"Outcome of the Joint Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 3 December 2014 The Bank of Thailand announced the outcome of the second joint meeting of MPC and FIPC for 2014 as follows. The Committees viewed that during the second half of the year, despite the gradual recovery of the Thai economy, the financial system remained stable. The banking sector continued to have strong financial performance, which enabled them to support the economic recovery through credit expansion. Meanwhile growth of household debt continued to decelerate. Nevertheless the banking system's loan quality especially that of consumer loan deteriorated slightly as a result of economic slowdown in the previous period. In addition, some large corporations had high debt-to-equity ratio, partly due to business expansion and financing cost lock-in during low interest rate environment, thereby potentially leaving them more sensitive to risk factors, going forward. The Committees viewed that the key risks to be closely monitored in the periods ahead are: strength of the economic recovery; increase in search-for-yield behavior among investors including speculation in some asset classes, which could induce financial fragility in the event of underpricing of risks; and household debt accumulated from the previous periods, which could slow recovery of private consumption as well as lower household's ability to service debt especially among low-income households with high debt burden. Therefore priorities should be placed on policies to improve household's financial management and discipline along with enhancement market mechanism, for example, expansion of the National Credit Bureau membership. In addition to domestic factors, there are risks from the uncertainty of global economic recovery as well as monetary policy directions of major economies, which could cause capital flow volatility. Thus the authorities and private sector should be prepared for these aforementioned risks.

Euroarea,2014-12-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to the first press conference in our new premises. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line with our forward guidance, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. As regards our non-standard monetary policy measures, we have started purchasing covered bonds and asset-backed securities. Next week, we will conduct the second targeted longer-term refinancing operation, to be followed by six further operations until June 2016. Taken together, our measures will have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet, which is intended to move towards the dimensions it had at the beginning of 2012. In the coming months, our measures will further ease the monetary policy stance more broadly, support our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates and reinforce the fact that there are significant and increasing differences in the monetary policy cycle between major advanced economies. However, the latest euro area macroeconomic projections indicate lower inflation, accompanied by weaker real GDP growth and subdued monetary dynamics. In this context, early next year the Governing Council will reassess the monetary stimulus achieved, the expansion of the balance sheet and the outlook for price developments. We will also evaluate the broader impact of recent oil price developments on medium-term inflation trends in the euro area. Should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation, the Governing Council remains unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate. This would imply altering early next year the size, pace and composition of our measures. In response to the request of the Governing Council. ECB staff and the relevant Eurosystem committees have stepped up the technical preparations for further measures, which could, if needed, be implemented in a timely manner. All of our monetary policy measures are geared towards underpinning the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations, in line with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2%, and contribute to a return of inflation rates towards that level. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP in the euro area rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of this year. This was in line with earlier indications of a weakening in the euro area's growth momentum, leading to a downward revision of the outlook for euro area real GDP growth in the most recent forecasts. The latest data and survey evidence up to November confirm this picture of a weaker growth profile in the period ahead. At the same time, the outlook for a modest economic recovery remains in place. On the one hand, domestic demand should be supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing improvements in financial conditions, the progress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, and significantly lower energy prices supporting real disposable income. Furthermore, demand for exports should benefit from the global recovery. On the other hand, the recovery is likely to continue to be dampened by high unemployment, sizeable unutilised capacity, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors. These elements are reflected in the December 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP increasing by 0.8% in 2014, 1.0% in 2015 and 1.5% in 2016. Compared with the September 2014 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the projections for real GDP growth have been revised substantially downwards. Downward revisions were made to the projections for both domestic demand and net exports. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area are on the downside. In particular, the weak euro area growth momentum, alongside high geopolitical risks, has the potential to dampen confidence and especially private investment. In addition, insufficient progress in structural reforms in euro area countries constitutes a key downward risk to the economic outlook. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 0.3% in November 2014, after 0.4% in October. Compared with the previous month, this mainly reflects a stronger fall in energy price inflation and a somewhat lower annual increase in services prices. Taking into account the current environment of very low rates of inflation, it will be important to assess the broader impact of recent oil price developments on medium-term inflation trends and to avoid spillovers to inflation expectations and wage formation. Against the background of recent oil price developments, it is crucial to recall that forecasts and projections are based on technical assumptions, especially for oil prices and exchange rates. On the basis of information available in mid-November, at the time the December 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area were finalised, annual HICP inflation was foreseen to reach 0.5% in 2014, 0.7% in 2015 and 1.3% in 2016. In comparison with the September 2014 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, they have been revised significantly downwards. These revisions reflect mainly lower oil prices in euro terms and the impact of the downwardly revised outlook for growth, but they do not yet incorporate the fall in oil prices over the past few weeks following the cut-off date for the projections. Over the coming months, annual HICP inflation rates could experience renewed downward movements, given the recent further decline in oil prices. The Governing Council will continue to closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term. In this context, we will focus in particular on the possible repercussions of dampened growth dynamics, geopolitical developments, exchange rate and energy price developments, and the pass-through of our monetary policy measures. We will be particularly vigilant as regards the broader impact of recent oil price developments on medium-term inflation trends in the euro area. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for October 2014 support the assessment of subdued underlying growth in broad money (M3), with the annual growth rate standing at 2.5% in October, unchanged from September. Annual growth in M3 continues to be supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 6.2% in October. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -1.6% in October, after -1.8% in September, showing a gradual recovery from a trough of -3.2% in February. On average over recent months, net redemptions have moderated from the historically high levels recorded a year ago. Lending to non-financial corporations continues to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply factors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was 0.6% in October, after 0.5% in September. The monetary policy measures in place and the completion of the ECB's comprehensive assessment should support a further stabilisation of credit flows. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirms the need to closely monitor the risks to the outlook for price developments over the medium term and to be prepared to provide further monetary policy accommodation, if needed. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to supporting economic activity. However, in order to strengthen investment activity, boost job creation and raise productivity growth, other policy areas need to contribute decisively. In particular, the determined implementation of product and labour market reforms as well as actions to improve the business environment for firms need to gain momentum in several countries. It is crucial that structural reforms be implemented credibly and effectively as this will raise expectations of higher incomes and encourage firms to increase investment today and bring forward the economic recovery. Fiscal policies should support the economic recovery, while ensuring debt sustainability in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, which remains the anchor for confidence. All countries should use the available scope for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies. The Investment Plan for Europe which the European Commission announced on 26 November 2014 will also support the recovery."
Armenia,2014-12-08,"PRESS RELEASE 12.08.2014 On the 12th August 2014 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 0.25 percentage point to 6.75%. There was 0.9% of deflation in July 2014 against 0.4% of inflation recorded in the same month last year; in the meanwhile, the 12‐month inflation rate has dropped to 0.4%. The Board believes that in the coming months the 12‐month inflation rate will gradually increase and, starting from Q1 2015, is expected to stabilize around its target. The Board notes that geopolitical developments have brought in more uncertainties in the external sector, associated with economic prospects in partner countries, yet significant inflationary pressures from the external environment are not likely. The Board estimates that domestic and foreign demand remained sluggish in Q2 2014, which contributed to a low level of inflation. The increase in electricity tariff since August as well as stamp duty to be introduced on a range of products starting from the fourth quarter this year will somewhat expand the inflationary environment. However, in the short run, the 12‐month inflation rate will remain low, somehow closer to the lower bound of the target at the end of the year. Easing of monetary conditions, coupled with expansionary fiscal policy expected to carry out starting from the second half of 2014, will lead to the expansion of aggregate demand and rebounded inflation rates during 2015. The Board agrees that economic developments in external and domestic sectors may be such that any further adjustments in the directions of the monetary policy are possible whilst making sure the inflation target remains attainable in the forecast horizon. More information about the interest rate decision will be available in the Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Report Q3, 2014) due on 22 August 2014. The Central Bank Press Service 1."
Philippines,2014-12-10,"Statement by BSP Governor Amando M Tetangco Jr. At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy rates at 4.00 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.00 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs and special deposit accounts (SDA) were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were left unchanged as well. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation environment continues to be more manageable, with the risks to the inflation outlook remaining broadly balanced over the policy horizon. Latest baseline forecasts show a lower inflation path for 2014-2016 relative to the previous policy meeting, reflecting in large part the subdued outlook for global commodity prices. Inflation expectations are also generally lower and remain aligned to the inflation target. Meanwhile, output growth moderated in Q3 2014 as agricultural production contracted amid unfavorable weather conditions and as public spending slowed down. The Monetary Board also noted that while global economic conditions remain challenging, prospects for domestic activity continue to be firm, supported by strong domestic demand, robust bank lending growth, and buoyant business sentiment. On balance, the Monetary Board is of the view that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriate given the manageable inflation outlook and favorable domestic growth prospects. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor evolving price and output developments and remains prepared to take appropriate measures as necessary to ensure that the monetary policy stance continues to support an environment characterized by price and financial stability."
Chile,2014-12-11,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 11 December 2014 Press Release1 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3% (annual). Internationally, recent information confirms the outlook of good economic performance in the United States and slower growth and low inflation in the Eurozone and Japan, a development that has widened the expected differences in the monetary policy implemented by those economies. Growth forecasts for emerging Asia have been revised down slightly, while for Latin America weak performance is confirmed in the larger part of the region. The prices of commodities receded, with a significant drop in the oil price standing out. The copper price posted a smaller decline. Output, demand, and employment indicators continue to reveal the low dynamism of the Chilean economy. Local financial conditions reflect the impact of the monetary stimulus. Annual inflation dropped, but it remains above 5% and core indicators are above 4%. In the most likely scenario inflation will stay above the upper bound of the tolerance range still for some months. The evolution of prices will continue to be monitored with special attention. Medium-term inflation expectations remain around 3%. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. 1 The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2014-12-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.00% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.00% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that, although the trend of economic recovery in the US has become more evident, the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area has continued while trends of economic growth in emerging market countries have differed from country to country. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, centering around the US, but judges that the possibility exists of its being affected by changes in the monetary policies of major countries, by the prolongation of economic sluggishness in the euro area, by the weakening of economic growth in some emerging market countries, and by geopolitical risks. In Korea, while exports have maintained generally favorable movements the Committee judges that the recoveries of consumption and facilities investment have been inadequate and that the sentiments of economic agents remain weak. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has expanded steadily, led by increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will gradually narrow going forward, albeit at a moderate pace. Consumer price inflation fell from 1.2% the month before to 1.0% in November, due mainly to declines in petroleum product prices and to slowdowns in the rates of industrial product price increase. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices fell to 1.6%, from 1.8% in October. Looking ahead, the Committee forecasts that inflation will gradually rise, after remaining at a low level for a considerable time influenced for example by declines in international oil prices. In the housing market the uptrend of sales prices has slowed, centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas, while leasehold deposit prices have continued to rise at a pace similar to that in October. In the domestic financial markets, the Korean won has continued its depreciation against the US dollar and its appreciation against the Japanese yen, in line with the strength of the dollar globally and the weakness of the yen. Stock prices, after having fluctuated within a relatively narrow range, have fallen to a considerable extent. Long- term market interest rates had shown a decline, in reflection mainly of expectations related to the monetary policies of major countries, but have rebounded. Looking ahead, while supporting the recovery of economic growth, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to maintain price stability over a medium-term horizon and pay attention to financial stability. In this process it will closely monitor external risk factors such as shifts in major countries' monetary policies, as well as the trends of household debt and of capital flows."
Russia,2014-12-11,"On 11 December 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to raise the Bank of Russia key rate to 10.5 percent per annum. In November — early December 2014 the upward movement of consumer prices kept on accelerating. Observed increase in inflation expectations and ruble depreciation expectations pose substantial inflation risks. The decision taken by the Bank of Russia is aimed at slowing consumer prices growth to the target of 4% in the medium run. In case of further aggravation of inflation risks, the Bank of Russia will continue to raise the key rate. In November — early December, inflation continued to accelerate. According to the estimates as of the 8 of December, annual consumer prices growth rate was equal to 9.4%. Core inflation rose to 8.9% in November 2014. Accelerated consumer prices growth is driven by ruble depreciation in the second half of 2014. External trade restrictions imposed in August 2014 also affected price dynamics. Meanwhile, price growth rate for certain food items flattened out due to the increase of supply by the Russian companies and new import contracts. Amid accelerated consumer prices growth, households' and businesses' inflation expectations continued to surge imposing additional pressure on prices. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, end of the year inflation will be around 10%. At the same time, the cumulative contribution of ruble depreciation, restrictions on imports and other factors specific for the markets of several food products, to year-to-year consumer prices growth will account for 4.9 percentage points by the year-end. Tighter monetary conditions have not offset the influence of the pro-inflationary factors. However, current monetary conditions set the ground for inflation decline in the medium run. According to the estimates as of the 1 of December 2014, annual money supply (M2) growth rate decreased to 4.8% from 16.3% a year earlier. Continuing growth of interest rates on household deposits stimulates the propensity to save and increases the attractiveness of deposits. Given lending rates hike and tighter borrower and collateral requirements, lending growth (adjusted for currency revaluation) slows down. Given the decision made today and time lags of the influence of the interest rate decisions made by the Bank of Russia earlier, on the economy, this process will continue. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, the annual GDP growth rate will amount to 0.6% in 2014. Economic slack does not have considerable restraining effect on consumer prices growth as it is mostly caused by structural factors. Utilisation of productive factors — labour force and commercially viable productive capacities — is high though labour productivity grows slowly. Due to the long-term demographic trends labour supply shrinks. The remaining external political uncertainty and considerable deterioration of external conditions, resulting from oil price drop and foreign financial markets inaccessibility for the Russian borrowers, also have an adverse impact on economic activity. Amid the increase in prices for the imported investment goods, limited access to long-term financing, and tighter lending conditions, fixed capital investments are contracting. Meanwhile, though the real wage growth and retail lending are slowing, consumer demand remains relatively high due to higher demand for non-food items amid higher inflation expectations. The exchange rate dynamics partially balances the negative impact of deterioration of the external conditions and contributes to higher competitiveness of Russian goods. Besides, restrictions on the import of certain food items support the relevant industries. Due to the considerable change in the external conditions, the Bank of Russia revised its medium-term macroeconomic forecast. During the next three-year period, economic growth will be lower than previously projected in the baseline scenario due to persistently lower oil prices. Annual GDP growth is expected to be close to zero in 2015-2016. Amid persistently restricted access to the international capital markets for Russian companies and relatively cheap energy resources, fixed capital investments will continue to edge lower. Consumption will remain weak. At the same time, the new exchange rate mechanism will set grounds for more rapid adjustment of the Russian economy to changing external conditions. Economic activity is expected to start recovering in 2017 due to the development of import substituting industries and increase in non-commodity exports. Over the next months, prices for goods and services will continue to be affected by depreciation of the ruble. During the first quarter of 2015 inflation might be higher than 10%. Nevertheless, inflation and inflation expectations are forecasted to decrease as the impact of the exchange rate dynamics on prices exhausts and economy gradually adjusts to changing external trade conditions and imposed restrictions on imports. Slowdown in consumer prices growth will also be facilitated by subdued aggregate demand with total goods and services output remaining below the potential. The current stance of monetary policy will result in inflation decrease to the target level of 4% in the medium term. In case of further aggravation of inflation risks, the Bank of Russia will continue to raise the key rate. Should inflation and inflation expectations show a stable downward trend, the Bank of Russia will be ready to start monetary policy easing. The next meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors on the key rate is scheduled for 30 January 2015. The press-release on the Bank of Russia Board of Directors' decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Peru,2014-12-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR DECEMBER 2014 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 3.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.50 percent. This level of the benchmark rate is compatible with the forecast that inflation will be converging to 2.0 percent target in 2015. This forecast takes into account that: economic activity projections continue showing levels below the potential levels; inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range; recent international indicators show mixed signals of global economic recovery, as well as increased volatility in financial and exchange markets, and the lower international prices of crude oil have started to reflect gradually in the domestic market. Inflation in November showed a negative rate of 0.15 percent, as a result of which inflation in the last 12 months rose from 3.09 percent in October to 3.16 percent in November. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.13 percent, as a result of which the interannual rate of inflation fell from 2.56 percent in October to 2.49 percent in November. The most recent indicators of activity continue showing lower GDP growth rates than the potential output rates for this year. In December, the BCRP has continued lowering the rate of reserve requirements in domestic currency from 10.0 to 9.5 percent with the aim of supporting the growth of credit in soles. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants, and will implement additional monetary easing measures if it is necessary. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 2.30 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.30 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.30 percent. The Monetary Program for the following twelve months will be approved on the Board meetings to be held according to the following schedule: January 15 February 12 March 12 April 9 May 14 June 11 July 9 August 13 September 10 October 16 November 12 December 10 In 2015 the BCRP will publish its Inflation Reports on the following dates: January 23 May 22 September 18 December 18."
Russia,2014-12-16,"From 16 December 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to raisethe Bank of Russia key rate to 17.00 percent per annum. This decision is aimed at limiting substantially increased ruble depreciation risks and inflation risks. From 16 December 2014 in order to strengthen the efficiency of monetary policy loans secured by non-marketable assets or guarantees for 2 to 549 days will be provided at a floating interest rate, set at the Bank of Russia key rate level, increased by 1.75 percentage points (up to the present these loans for 2 to 90 days were provided at fixed rate). Moreover, for further expanse of credit institution ability to manage their foreign exchange liquidity it was decided to increase maximum allotment amount for 28-day FX REPO auctions from 1.5 to 5.0 billion USD and to conduct 12-month FX REPO auctions on weekly basis.

Czech Republic,2014-12-17,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. the willingness only to intervene against appreciation of the koruna below the announced level, is unchanged.. This decision is based on the message of the current forecast and on an assessment of newly available information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until 2016 Q1. According to the forecast, the return to conventional monetary policy will not imply appreciation of the exchange rate to the level recorded before the CNB started intervening, as the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through to prices and other nominal variables. In the light of the newly available information, the balance of risks to the current forecast is assessed as being anti-inflationary, mainly reflecting developments abroad. In this situation, the Bank Board repeated that the Czech National Bank would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2016. At the same time, the Bank Board stated that the deflationary pressures from abroad were currently associated largely with a positive supply shock, in particular a fall in energy commodity prices. Only if there were to be a long-term increase in deflation pressures capable of causing a slump in domestic demand, renewed risks of deflation in the Czech economy and a systematic decrease in inflation expectations, would it be necessary to consider moving the exchange rate commitment to a weaker level. After accelerating during the second and third quarters of this year, annual headline inflation edged down to 0.6% in November. This level was 0.2 percentage point lower than forecasted. This deviation was due chiefly to the fact that this year's increase in excise duties will feed into cigarette prices later than expected. In addition, slightly lower annual food price inflation, fuel price inflation and core inflation were recorded in November. The published data continue to confirm the CNB‘s opinion that the decision made last year to start using the exchange rate as an additional monetary policy instrument contributed significantly to averting the threat of deflation linked with a drop in demand. According to the forecast, headline inflation will go up owing mainly to rising economic activity and accelerating wage growth. According to the forecast, both headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation will return to the CNB's 2% target in early 2016, i.e. at the monetary policy horizon. They will then be slightly above the target. Real GDP rose by 2.4% year on year in 2014 Q3. This figure was 0.2 percentage point lower than forecasted. In quarter-on-quarter terms, economic activity increased by 0.4% as expected. In line with the forecast, all components of domestic demand contributed to the year-on-year growth in GDP. By contrast, net exports made a slightly negative contribution as a result of rising imports, reflecting, as expected, the recovery in investment activity and household consumption. The CNB's forecast that  after contracting in the previous two years  the domestic economy will grow noticeably for this year as a whole owing to higher external demand, a recovery in government investment and last but not least to easy domestic monetary conditions, is thus being fulfilled. Next year the economy is forecasted to record the same growth rate as this year. According to new information on developments abroad obtained from the December Consensus Forecasts survey and current market outlooks, the outlook for consumer price inflation and especially producer price inflation in the euro area has been lowered over the entire forecast horizon. The outlook for external demand and three-month market interest rates in the euro area have shifted in the same direction, albeit only marginally. Oil prices have fallen by almost one-quarter over the entire outlook compared to the assumptions of the current forecast. The price of Brent crude oil is currently well below USD 65 a barrel. As regards oil prices in euro terms and, in turn, koruna terms, the impact of the significantly lower dollar prices of oil is only partly offset by a stronger outlook for the exchange rate of the dollar against the euro. Although the decline in oil prices should be viewed as a positive supply shock, one which will contribute to faster growth in the economic performance of many countries, its short-term downward effects on prices do not come at an appropriate time from the perspective of inflation expectations. It cannot be ruled out, therefore, that growth in economic activity in the euro area will remain very subdued. In such an environment, a sharp drop in commodity prices may lead to a decrease in both producer and consumer prices. Overall, developments abroad represent a significant anti-inflationary risk for the Czech economy. By contrast, the ongoing domestic economic growth continues to have a favourable effect on the labour market situation to a degree which exceeds our expectations overall. This is evidenced by faster-than-expected growth in total employment, continuing growth in the number of employees converted into full-time equivalents and  last but not least  a still rising number of vacancies. At the same time, the seasonally adjusted general unemployment rate fell faster than expected and the number of registered unemployed persons also continued to decline. On the other hand, wage growth in the business sector slowed unexpectedly, falling slightly below 2%. Wage growth in the non-business sector was also lower than forecasted. A slightly rising trend in industrial production, accompanied by a sizeable year-on-year increase in export sales, remains in place. Continuing growth in external and domestic demand is also reflected in a persisting rise in new industrial orders, driven by domestic and foreign orders in equal measure in October. Retail sales are also rising noticeably in both the automotive segment and the sale of other non-food products. Construction output is increasing mainly on account of a recovery in government investment. Overall, these indicators suggest that the economy will continue to grow roughly at the current pace at the close of this year. The gradual recovery in producer prices, driven largely by the weakening of the koruna since the start of this year, has come to a halt. Prices in manufacturing in fact saw a marginal year-on-year decrease in November, owing partly to a price drop in oil processing. By contrast, the forecast had expected slowing but still positive price growth in manufacturing. The annual decline in agricultural producer prices deepened and was slightly more pronounced than forecasted. Conversely, prices in construction and services continued to rise moderately. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy, annual GDP growth was slightly below the forecast in 2014 Q3. Inflation has also been slightly lower so far in Q4. The average wage rose considerably more slowly than expected in Q3. The seasonally adjusted share of unemployed persons declined slightly faster than forecasted."
Georgia,2014-12-17,"17.12.14 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate unchanged at 4.00%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on December 17, 2014 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 4 percent. The economies of our main trading partners have been deteriorating as of late, affecting Georgian economy. According to preliminary information both goods export and remittances have significantly decreased in November. Despite recent depreciation of GEL vs USD, the nominal effective exchange rate has appreciated. This, coupled with the general trend of decline in world commodity prices allows concluding that no increase in inflationary pressure should be expected. According to existing forecasts inflation will reach its 5% target value in the second half of 2015. Hence, the National Bank still considers the phased exit out of accommodative monetary policy and considers increasing the policy rate to 5% by the second half of 2015. At the same time, the National Bank took into account that the difficult situation in the region will negatively affect the external demand and therefore decided to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged at 4.0%. The annual inflation in November 2014 was 2.8%. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure price stability. The dynamics of further changes in monetary policy will depend on the dynamics of expected inflation, tendencies in economic growth, global and regional economic environment. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on February 11, 2015."
United States,2014-12-17,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions improved further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate. On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish. Household spending is rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced. The Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy. The Committee sees this guidance as consistent with its previous statement that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program in October, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated. Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Stanley Fischer; Loretta J Mester; Jerome H Powell; and Daniel K Tarullo. Voting against the action were Richard W Fisher, who believed that, while the Committee should be patient in beginning to normalize monetary policy, improvement in the U.S. economic performance since October has moved forward, further than the majority of the Committee envisions, the date when it will likely be appropriate to increase the federal funds rate; Narayana Kocherlakota, who believed that the Committee's decision, in the context of ongoing low inflation and falling market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, created undue downside risk to the credibility of the 2 percent inflation target; and Charles I Plosser, who believed that the statement should not stress the importance of the passage of time as a key element of its forward guidance and, given the improvement in economic conditions, should not emphasize the consistency of the current forward guidance with previous statements."
Armenia,2014-12-23,"PRESS RELEASE 23.12.2014 At the December 23, 2014 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank decided to raise the refinancing rate by 1.75 pp to 8.50%. Inflation in November 2014 was 1.3% compared to 0.9% recorded for the same month last year, and the 12-month inflation amounted to 2.6%. In the external sector, latest developments included accelerating growth rates of the U.S. economy, which led to expectations for further increase in interest rates in the U.S.A. This triggered a capital flow from developing countries to the U.S.A., resulting in slowdown of economic growth rates and depreciation of currencies in main developing countries. Almost all developing countries responded to this event through a certain rise in interest rates, while moderating the inflationary pressures. The falling of commodity prices, and the oil price in particular, as well as the geopolitical issues have contributed to the negative expectations of the Russian economy and depreciation of the Russian ruble and the currencies of other post-Soviet countries. The aforementioned developments in the global and regional economies also influenced the Armenian economy  reduced foreign currency flows from the rest of the world exerted depreciation pressures in the domestic currency market. The speed at which prices of certain goods grew on the back of depreciating local currency brought in destabilized inflation expectations, which led to a sharp increase in demand for goods and foreign currency and significant additional inflationary pressures. Although it is expected that by the end of the year the 12-month inflation rate will still hover within the confidence band, the Board of the Central Bank finds it appropriate to increase the refinancing rate in order to ease future inflationary pressures and anchor existing inflation expectations around the target. As external and domestic economic developments unfold, the Central Bank will adjust the directions of monetary policy, while further attaining the inflation target in the medium term. Detailed information based on the setting of interest rate will be available in press release due on December 30, 2014 (Interest rate minutes). Press Service of the Central Bank."
Turkiye,2014-12-24,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 11.25 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 10.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 7.5 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 8.25 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.75 percent. Loan growth continues at reasonable levels in response to the tight monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures. The favorable developments in the terms of trade and the moderate course of consumer loans will contribute to the improvement in the current account balance. External demand remains weak, while the contribution of domestic demand to growth is at moderate levels. The Committee assessed that the implementation of the announced structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Macroprudential measures taken at the beginning of the year and the tight monetary policy stance continue to have a favorable impact on the core inflation trend. Moreover, declining commodity prices, in particular oil prices, will contribute to disinflation. Under the current monetary policy stance, the Committee anticipates that, inflation will decline in line with the forecast presented in the Inflation Report throughout 2015, at a faster pace in the first half of the year. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors that affect inflation will be closely monitored and the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained, by keeping a flat yield curve, until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2014-12-29,"The rate of inflation as measuredover the previous 12 months was negative 0.1 percent, compared with negative 0.3 percent over the 12 months ending in October. Excluding the expectedeffect of a reduction in electricity and water prices, inflation expectations for the coming year from the various sources are near the lower bound of the inflation target range. According to the Research Department's staff forecast, the inflation rate in 2015 is expected to be 1.1 percent,and net of the effect of the electricity and water price reductions it is expected to be 1.5 percent. Indicators which became available this month point to a recovery in activity after Operation Protective Edge, with the economy's expected return to its path of growth from before the operation expressed in a relatively high growth rate in the coming quarters. Partial data from the fourth quarter Companies Survey support this assessment, and the Composite State of the Economy Index continues to increase at the moderate rate that has characterized it since the beginning of theyear. All labor market indicators also signal continued improvement. Basedon the Research Department's staff forecast, growth in 2015 is expected to be 3.2 percent. There was considerable volatility in the foreign exchange market this month. Over the course of the month, the shekel appreciated by 0.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchangerate, and weakened by 2 percent against the dollar. Since the beginning ofAugust, when the trend of depreciation in the effective exchange rate began, the shekel has weakened by 6.9 percent, and it has depreciated by about 3.7 percent since the beginning of the year. Continued depreciation will support a recovery in exports and in the tradable sector as a whole, and is expected to contribute to returning the inflation rate to within the target range. There are increasing signs that the US recovery is solidifying, while weakness continues in Europe. Japan and most emerging markets. The crisis in Russia was expressed in increased volatility in global financial markets. The decline in energy prices is expected to continue to reduce global inflation and to support the economic recovery. Financial markets are pricing in an initial increase in the US federal funds rate in the third quarter of 2015; in Europe and in other economies, monetary easing continues. Home prices increased sharply in September-October, even before the announcement of the cancellation of the zero-VAT plan, and it appears that there is an increase in the rate of mortgages being taken out and in new home sales. There were sharp increases in the number of building starts andbuilding completions in the third quarter. This month, there was a slight increase in corporate bond market spreads, and extensive negative net new investment in bond funds. Staff ForecastBackground conditions. The decision regarding the interest rate for February 2015 will be published at 16:00 on Monday. January 26, 2015. Inflation data: The Consumer PriceIndex (CPI) for November declined by 0.2 percent, in line with forecasters' projections. The clothing and footwear component increased markedly, while the fruit and vegetables, and transport and communication components declined notably. The inflation rate over the past 12 months was negative 0.1 percent, compared with negative 0.3 percent over the 12 months endedin October. The tradable goods components of the CPI declined by 0.4 percent this month, and their rate of decline over the past 12 months remained unchanged from the previous month, at 1.8 percent. The CPI components representing nontradable items declined by 0.1 percent this month; their rate of increase over the previous 12 months increased to 0.9 percent, compared with 0.6 percent in the 12 months ending in October. Over the past 12 months, there have been marked declines in the food, fruit and vegetables, and furniture and household equipment components, with only the housing component increasing significantly. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The declines in water and electricity prices that are planned for the beginning of January are expected to reduce the inflation rate by about 0.4 percent, in a one-off effect. Against this background, inflation expectations derived from various sources remain low. Inflation expectations derived from the capital market were volatile during the month, due to fluctuations in government bond yields, and at the end of the period, one-year inflation expectations (seasonally adjusted) were 0.45 percent, and expectations for two years were 0.8 percent. Private forecasters' projectionsfor the next 12 CPI readings declined from 0.7 percent to 0.6 percent, on average. Expectations for the coming 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates declined from 0.4 percent to 0.3 percent. Expectations for medium and long terms were also volatile during the month, and showed slight increases at the end of the period. Based on private forecasters' projections, and data derived from the makam and Telbor curves, no change is expected in the Bank of Israel interest rate in the next three months. Real economic activity: Indicators that became available this month continue to point to a recovery in economic activity after Operation Protective Edge, though the conflict's negative impact on the economy and on growth has not yet been fully compensated for. Foreign trade data declined this month (in dollar terms; dueto the strengthening of the dollar worldwide it may be assumed that the quantitative decline was smaller). Goods exports (excluding ships and aircraft and diamonds) declined by 3.0 percent in November, compared with October,after increasing in the previous two months. Goods imports (excluding ships and aircraft, diamonds and fuels) declined by 1.5 percent, further to themarked decline in October. Exports of other business services (excluding start-ups) remained unchanged at the peak levels they reached at the beginning of the year. Data on tourist arrivals and overnight stays indicate some recovery in the tourism industry, and it is occurring at a relatively rapidrate compared with that following previous security incidents. However, tourism service exports, and with them agricultural exports, to Russia constitute a marked share of overall tourism service and agricultural exports: even though total exports to Russia are only a small share of Israel's total exports: so these industries are therefore liable to be negatively impacted by the crisis there. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.1 percent in November, similar to its pace of increase since the beginning of the year. Preliminary data from the Bank of Israel's Companies Survey for the fourth quarter point to improvement in the state of companies and a return of activity to its level at the beginning of 2014. The business sector Climate Index, based on the Business Tendency Survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics for November, continues to indicate a relatively low monthly growth rate, of 0.17 percent. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by Bank Hapoalim continued to decline this month, returning to its level at the beginning of 2014. The Consumer Confidence Index compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics has remained virtually unchanged since July. Bank Hapoalim's Purchasing Managers Index increased slightly in November, to 48.7 points, and remains belowthe level that distinguishes between contraction and expansion. The labor market: Labor market data that became available this month bolster the positive picture emerging from that market. The Labor Force Survey for November indicates an increase in both the employment and participation rates among the primary working ages (25-64) by 0.6 percentage points, with the unemployment rate remaining low at 4.8 percent. The overall unemployment rate declined by 0.1 percentage points to 5.6 percent. In parallel, the number of those employed full-time increased in August-November by 4.2 percent, and the numberof those employed on a part-time basis declined by 1.4 percent. The numberof employee posts rose by 0.7 percent in September, compared to August, with the increase occurring in both the business sector and in the public services. Nominal wages increased in July-September by 1.0 percent, and real wages increased by 0.9 percent, compared to April-June (seasonally adjusted data). Health tax receipts continued to increase at a stable rate, and were 5.4 percent higher (in nominal terms) in October-November than the corresponding period last year. Budget data: In JanuaryC 2AD-November, the deficit in the government's domestic activity (excluding net credit) was about NIS 9.6 billion. This is about NIS 4.9 billion smaller than the deficit in the seasonal path consistent with meeting the 2014 deficit target, as expenditure has been lower than the seasonal path consistent with full budget performance. Total domestic expenditures (excluding credit) were NIS 6.6 billion lower in January-November than the expenditure consistent with the seasonal path. With that, expenditure is expected to accelerate in December and reach full budget performance for 2014, due to, among other things, the defense supplement. Domestic revenuesfrom the beginning of the year are about NIS 1.7 billion lower than the seasonal path consistent with the budget forecast. Based on trend data, tax revenue in November, excluding one-time effects, remained without significant change compared to previous months. The transition to a 1/12 budget will not restrict budget performance in most months during 2015 compared with the budget proposal that was approved by the government, since the redemptionof debts expected in 2015 is smaller than in 2014. With that, there will be a limitation on expenditures for new programs. Research Department staff forecast: This month the Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast. The notice of the forecast is being published in parallel with this release. According to the revised forecast, the inflation rate in 2015 will be 1.1 percent (1.5 percent excluding the effect of the decline in electricity and water prices); the Bank of Israel interest rate is expected, according to the staff forecast, to remain at 0.25 percent throughout 2015 and to increase slowly in 2016. GDP is expected to grow in 2014 by 2.5 percent (2.3 percent in the previous forecast), in 2015 it is expected to grow by 3.2 percent (3.0 percent in the previous forecast), and in 2016 it is expected to growby 3.0 percent. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on November 24, 2014, through December 25, 2014, the shekel weakened by 2 percent against the dollar. The shekel appreciated by 0.7 percent against the euro, and by 0.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. For the year to date, the shekel has weakened by about 3.7 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on November 24, 2014, through December 25,2014, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 1.3 percent. Government bond yields increased, as yields on the unindexed curve increased by about 25 basis points for most terms and yields on the CPI-indexed curve increased by an average of about 15 basis points. The yield on unindexed 10-year bondsincreased by around 30 basis points, to about 2.45 percent, and the yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and corresponding 10-year US Treasury securities returned to a positive value and increased to about 20 basis points. Makam yields increased byabout 7 basis points along the entire curve. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread declined slightly, to about 77 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in November, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the publicand demand deposits) increased by 32.8 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 8.4 percent. The credit market: Total outstanding debt of the business sector declined by about NIS 0.7 billion (0.1 percent) in October, to NIS 817 billion, primarily as a result of net repayment of bank loans which was partly offset by the depreciation of the shekel. InNovember, the nonfinancial business sector only issued about NIS 0.9 billion in bonds, compared with a monthly average of NIS 2.7 billion since the beginning of the year. After negative net new investment by the public in corporate bond mutual funds in recent months, there were extensive withdrawals from such funds as well as from general bond funds in December, with a slight increase in corporate bond market spreads, primarily in the investmentand holding companies sector. Outstanding household debt increased by about NIS 3.1 billion (0.7 percent) in October, to about NIS 431 billion. Of that, outstanding housing debt increased by about NIS 1 billion. In November,about NIS 4 billion in new mortgages were taken out, compared with a monthly average of about NIS 4.2 billion since the beginning of the year. The interest rate on new mortgages taken out declined in November on all tracks, with the decline most notable in the unindexed, fixed-rate, track. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.2 percent inNovember, similar to the previous month. In the 12 months that ended in November, this component increased by 2.7 percent. After declines in home prices reported in the previous two months' data, in September-October, still before the announcement of the cancellation of the zero-VAT plan, they increased sharply, by 1.4 percent. The trend of decline in the annual rate of increase in home prices halted, with prices increasing by 6.5 percent over the 12 months ending in October, compared with an increase of 4.6 percent in the 12 months ended in September. The increase in the number of new home sales continued in October, after a sharp increase in September. There was no change in the number of new homes available for sale. The first tenders in the target-pricing program commenced this month. In the third quarter, there were sharp increases in building starts and building completions, and in the past 12 months they totaled 44,200 and 42,100, respectively.</div> The global economy: The divergent trends in the global economy continued this month, with strong growth in the US and weakness in Europe. Japan, and emerging economies. The decline in fuel prices is expected to support the global economy. However, as occurredin Russia, it is liable to negatively impact the economic stability of oilexporters. In the US, third quarter growth was again revised upward. In the labor market. US nonfarm payrolls increased by around 320,000 in November, and industrial production reached its highest level since 2010. In contrast, weakness is apparent in the real estate industry, and purchasing managers indices were mostly disappointing. There is some moderation in inflation, in light of the decline in energy prices, and financial markets are pricing in a first increase in the federal funds rate in the third quarter of 2015. In Europe, the fragile and uneven recovery continues, with the unemployment rate remaining above 11 percent. In France and Italy, weak data were published this month, while in Germany slightly better data were published. The eurozone's Current Account surprised to the upside, against thebackground of the weakening of the euro, and there is an increasing probability that the ECB will launch a significant quantitative easing program in 2015. In Switzerland, a negative interest rate was set for deposits at thecentral bank, against the background of strengthening appreciation pressures, and in Norway the interest rate was reduced due to the expected negative impact on the economy of the decline in oil prices. In Japan, a reductionin corporate taxes and a deferral of an increase in the VAT rate followingelection results are expected to support recovery, but in contrast they will increase fiscal risk. Disappointing macro data were published in China this month, and inflation there is moderating against the background of the decline in oil prices. In Brazil, the virtual standstill continues, and nonetheless the interest rate was increased due to high inflation. In India, positive trends continue, and the recovery is expected to continue. In recent days, it appears that the policy measures in Russia stabilized the situation there for now. There was a mixed trend on global financial markets thismonth, with an increase in volatility. Oil prices declined by more than 20 percent this month, and the price of a barrel of Brent Sea crude oil reached $60. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for January 2015 unchanged at 0.25 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the nexttwelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerationsunderlying the decision: The rate of inflation as measuredover the previous 12 months was negative 0.1 percent, compared with negative 0.3 percent over the 12 months ending in October. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the current level of the interest rate supports the continuation of the recovery in economic activity, and the return of inflation to within the target range. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it and will examine the need touse various tools to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. ----------------------------------- The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for January 2015 will be publishedon January 12, 2015.
