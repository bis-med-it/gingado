Armenia,2022-01-02,"PRESS RELEASE 01.02.2022 Refinancing Rate Set at 8.0% At February 1, 2022 meeting, the CBA Board decided to raise refinancing rate by 0.25 percentage points, setting it at 8.0%. 12-month inflation in December 2021 decreased to 7.7%. 12-month core inflation dropped in line with the CBA projections and totaled 7.3%. Economic recovery continues in the main partner countries of Armenia. Amid higher energy prices and production chains' disruptions, high inflationary environment in the international markets of food and commodities persists. The increase in international prices is further reflected in a higher-than-projected level of inflation in the partner countries. To this end. Central Banks of the partner countries plan to tighten monetary conditions at a faster than expected pace. As a result, the external sector will still have an inflationary impact on the Armenian economy. A new wave of the pandemic is spreading rapidly in Armenia, but its impact on the economy is presumably mild. At the end of 2021, higher-than-expected economic activity was observed in the construction and industry sectors. The Board agrees that aggregate demand remains high due to external demand, thus still conducing to the inflationary environment. The latter, as well as the expected changes in regulated prices, are reflected in the dynamics of inflation expectations. In view of the above, the Board judges appropriate to increase the refinancing rate. Due to these policy actions, 12-month inflation will gradually decrease and approach the 4% target in the forecast horizon. The Central Bank Board considers that given geopolitical developments, the uncertainty related to the macroeconomic prospects is still high. At the same time, risks of inflation deviating from the projected path are mainly upwards. Should these risks materialize, the Board stands ready to respond accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective. Detailed information on the interest rate decision will be available in the Press Release to be published by February 15, 2022 (Interest Rate Statement)."
Israel,2022-01-03,"Economic activity continues apace, and labor market data for November and the first half of December indicate an improvement in the employment indices. However, the increase in the morbidity rate and in the infection coefficient due to the 'Omicron' variant, increase the risk to activity and may have macroeconomic significance in accordance with their scope. These developments are leading to an increase in uncertainty regarding the intensity of economic activity in the short and medium term. Inflation in Israel stabilized around the midpoint of the target range. The CPI for November declined by 0.1 percent. Inflation in the past 12 months was 2.4 percent. Inflation expectations forthe coming year and for the medium and long terms are within the target range. Since the previous interest rate decision, there has been increased volatility in the exchange rate. At the end of the period, the shekel had weakened by 0.7 percent against the US dollar, by 1 percent against the euro, and by 0.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Economic activity continues apace. Labor market data for November and the first half of December indicate a marked improvement in the employment indices. The Research Department revised its macroeconomic staff forecast. Its assessment is that GDP will grow by 5.5 percent in 2022, and by 5 percent in 2023. Home prices increased by 10.3 percent in the past 12 months, a significantly higher rate than in recent years. The global economy continued its trend of recovery during the reviewed period, but there was an increase in uncertainty in view of the spread of the 'Omicron' variant, which may cause difficulties in the production and supply chains. In most countries, the inflation indices have increased to levels higher than their central bank targets, and monetary tightening around the world continues. The Israeli economy's process of recovery from the crisis continues. However, there are still challenges to economic activity. The Committee will therefore continue to conduct an accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time, in accordance with the pace of growth, employment, and the path of inflation. This is in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy targets and the economic recovery from the crisis,and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, click here. The ongoing economic activity in Israel continues to expand alongside the COVID-19 pandemic and the cyclical nature of the waves of morbidity. This has been possible, in part, thanks to the adaptation of most industries to functioning alongside the pandemic. However, the increase in the morbidity rate and in the infection coefficient due to the 'Omicron' variant increase the risk to activity and may have macroeconomic significance in accordance with their scope. Since the previous interest rate decision, inflation in Israel has been stable around the midpoint of the target range (Figure 1). Inflation in the past 12 months was 2.4 percent (2.1 percent net of energy and fruit and vegetables; Figure 2). The year over year rates of increase in the prices of nontradable components and in the prices of tradable components stabilized (Figure 3). One-year inflation expectations from all sources declined slightly, and are within the target range. However, there remains a gap between expectations derived from the capital market, and the lower expectations derived from the banks' internal interest rates and of the professional forecasters, although the gap narrowed during the reviewed period (Figure 4). Medium- and long-term expectations are all within the target range (Figure 5). The Monetary Committee continues to closely monitor these developments, and maintains its assessment that there is no concern of an inflationary outbreak. Since the previous interest rate decision, there was some volatility in the exchange rate. At the end of the period, the shekel had weakened by 0.7 percent against the US dollar, by 1 percent against the euro, and by 0.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate (Figure 6). The aggregate balance of the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey continued to increase in November (Figure 15), and is similar to its precrisis level in 2019. In view of the continued global supply chain difficulties, there was an increase in the intensity of the equipment and raw materials constraints that companies reported (Figure 26). Credit card purchases stabilized at a high level since the end of October. However, with the increase in the spread of the Omicron variant in December, there was a decline in credit card purchases, especially in the domestic tourism industries (Figure 17). Goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds) remained unchanged, and remain higher than their precrisis levels. Services exports continued their upward trend, and are at a very high level (Figure 18). Goods imports continue to increase, and all components are at high levels (Figure 20). Labor market data for November show a marked improvement in the employment indices. The broad unemployment rate declinedto about 6.5 percent in November (Figure 21). The adjusted employment rate increased to 60.2 percent: the highest level since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic: reflecting a gap of about 60,000 employed persons (0.9 percentage points) compared with the average employment rate in 2019. Labor market data for the first half of December show a similar picture. The number of job vacancies remained high in November, and is higher than in the months prior to the crisis (Figure 23). The high level of job vacancies alongside the decline in unemployment reflect a tightening of the labor market. It should be noted that, at least until September, wage levels (after neutralizing the effects of the composition of employees that typified the COVID-19 crisis period) in most industries were similar to the precrisis trend, but there has been some recent acceleration in wage increases in some industries. The Bank of Israel Research Department revised its staff forecast. In its assessment. GDP will grow by 5.5 percent in 2022 and by 5 percent in 2023 (Figure 14). The adjusted employment rate is expected to continue increasing slightly, to 60.7 percent at the end of 2023. Accordingly, the broad unemployment rate is expected to continue declining, to about 4.4 percent at the end of 2023. The inflation rate is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2022, and 2 percent in 2023. In addition, the debt to GDP ratio in 2022 and 2023 is expected to be 69 percent. Home prices increased by 10.3 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 10), a significantly higher pace than in previous years. The volume of mortgages taken out remained high in November, in line with the trend since the beginning of 2021 (Figure 11). Alongside these, the annual rate of increase in rental prices remained relatively moderate, although there was some increase in the most recent data. In the domestic capitalmarket, equity prices continue to increase, and government bond yields declined slightly in most ranges. Corporate bond spreads increased slightly, but remained low. (Figure 9). The credit market continues to function well, with stable and low interest rates. The Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey shows that financing difficulties among businesses of various sizes have returned to levels similar to those prior to the crisis (Figure 13). The global economy continued its trend of recovery during the reviewed period, but there was an increase in uncertainty toward the end of the period, in view of the spread of the 'Omicron' variant. The increase in morbidity may lead to a slowdown in the pace of economic activity in the short term, and may continue to cause difficulties in the production and supply chains. The revised growth forecasts of the various investment houses remained virtually unchanged. The global Purchasing Managers Index increased slightly and continues to indicate a relatively high level of economic expansion, particularly in the services sector (Figure 30). The volume of world trade also increased slightly, and remains at relatively high levels (Figure 29). The positive sentiment in the equity markets in most advanced economies continues. The government bond markets were typified by a mixed trend. Yields in Europe increased, while there was a slight flattening in the US yield curve. Oil and other commodity prices remained virtually unchanged. Natural gas prices in Europe were very volatile in view of the energy crisis in Europe. The global inflation environment continues to increase. In most countries, the inflation indicesincreased to levels higher than their central bank targets, and in some, core inflation is also higher than the targets. Some central banks and forecasters therefore adjusted their assessments regarding the temporary nature of the inflation, and monetary tightening around the world continued. In the US, the Federal Reserve left the federal funds rate unchanged, but again cut the amounts to be purchased in its government bondand mortgage-backed securities purchasing program, so that the programs are expected to draw to a close in March. In addition, the Fed revised the forecast pace of interest rate increases upward, in view of the further increase in inflation, to a year-over-year level of 6.8 percent, and the continued recovery of the labor market. In Europe, the sharp increase in annual inflation continues, with the rate now at 4.9 percent. The ECB left its interest rate unchanged, and announced a reduction of its purchases in the markets. In the UK, inflation increased sharply, to 5.1 percent, and the Bank of England increased its interest rate by 15 basis points to 0.25 percent. There were interest rate increasesin a number of additional countries where inflation was significantly higher than the central bank targets (Figure 34). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on January 17, 2022. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. February 21, 2022."
Poland,2022-01-04,"Warsaw, 4 January 2022 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 4 January 2022 The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.50 percentage points, i.e. to 2.25%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: ▪ lombard rate at 2.75%; ▪ deposit rate at 1.75%; ▪ rediscount rate at 2.30%; ▪ discount rate at 2.35%. The activity in global economy continues to recover, yet economic conditions are under a negative impact of supply-side constraints in some markets, high commodity prices and re-escalation of the pandemic in certain countries, including the euro area. Latest forecasts indicate that global GDP growth in 2022 will be relatively robust, although lower than in 2021. The spread of a new variant of coronavirus remains an uncertainty factor for further course of the global epidemic and economic developments. Energy commodity prices  in particular prices of natural gas, oil and coal  as well as prices of some agricultural commodities run at markedly higher levels than a year ago. At the same time, global supply chain disruptions continue and international shipping costs are still elevated. Together with a strong recovery in demand, this contributes to a marked rise in inflation globally, which in many countries has reached highest levels in decades. Moreover, also inflation forecasts for the coming quarters have been revised up, which points to the risk of longer than previously judged impact of pandemic shock on inflationary processes. Amidst strong increase in current and expected inflation many central banks are withdrawing monetary accommodation, however, decisions of monetary authorities are not homogenous and take into account conditions for conducting monetary policy in particular economies. Central banks in the Central-Eastern Europe region have been increasing interest rates. The ECB keeps negative interest rates, but it announced a reduction in the scale of asset purchases. The US Federal Reserve has increased the pace of reduction in monthly asset purchases while keeping interest rates close to zero. 1/3 In Poland, despite another wave of increase in infections, economic activity continues to recover, as indicated by monthly data on industrial production, retail sales and construction and assembly output. The situation in the labour market continues to improve, which is reflected in decreasing unemployment, rising employment and a marked increase in average wages. In the coming quarters economic conditions are expected to remain favourable. However, there are uncertainty factors related to the impact of the pandemic on global and domestic economic conditions, as well as to the effects of supply-side constraints and high energy commodity prices on the economy. Inflation in Poland in November 2021 increased to 7.8% in annual terms, and in monthly terms it amounted to 1.0%. A significant contribution to an increase in inflation was made by the rise in global prices of commodities  including energy and agricultural commodities  observed in the second half of 2021, record high increase in prices of CO 2 emission allowances, rising prices of goods whose supply has been constrained by global pandemic disruptions as well as earlier increase in electricity prices and in waste disposal charges. Ongoing economic recovery, including demand driven by rising household income, has also added to an increase in inflation. These factors, together with a rise in regulated tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy will contribute to inflation remaining at an elevated level also in 2022. In turn, a reduction in some tax rates as part of the so-called Anti-inflationary Shield will have a curbing impact on inflation. In a longer perspective, inflation will decrease, which will be supported by expected fading of some global shocks currently boosting price growth, as well as by an increase in the NBP interest rates. At the same time, amidst further economic recovery and expected continuation of favourable labour market conditions, as well as probably more lasting impact of external shocks on price dynamics, there persists a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. In order to reduce this risk, i.e. striving to decrease inflation to the NBP target in the medium term, the Council decided to increase NBP interest rates again. The increase of the NBP interest rates will also curb inflation expectations. Decisions of the Council in the coming months will continue to be aimed at reducing inflation to a level consistent with the NBP inflation target in the medium term, while taking into account economic conditions, so as to ensure medium-term price stability and at the same time support sustainable economic growth after the global pandemic shock. The Council's assessment regarding the total scale of monetary tightening necessary for 2/3 achieving these goals will consider incoming information on perspectives for inflation and economic growth, including situation in the labour market. NBP may still intervene in the foreign exchange market and use other instruments envisaged in the Monetary Policy Guidelines. The timing and scale of the measures taken by NBP will depend on the market conditions."
Peru,2022-01-06,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT JANUARY 2022 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 3.0% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 50 bps to 3.00 percent, continuing the normalization of the stance of monetary policy. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation increased from 5.66 percent in November to 6.43 percent in December, temporarily above the target range due mainly to a surge in international food and fuel prices, as well as exchange rate depreciation. Year-on-year core inflation was 3.24 percent in December, above the upper limit of the target range. Inflation is expected to return to the target range in the fourth quarter of the year, as transitory pressures (exchange rate and international fuel and grain prices) recede, with economic activity below potential. One-year-ahead expected inflation for 2022 increased from 3.5 percent to 3.7 percent, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most indicators of expectations for economic activity remain in pessimistic territory in December. Global economic activity is improving, although at a slower pace due to new COVID-19 outbreaks, the emergence of new variants, and bottlenecks in global supply of goods and services. This recovery is expected to continue into the next quarters, as the vaccination rollout continues around the world and significant stimulus packages are implemented in developed countries. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation expectations and economic activity, with an aim to consider, if necessary, changes in the monetary stance so that inflation returns to the target range. Based on the available information, the Board sees the convenience of continuing the normalization of monetary policy in the next months. In a context of uncertainty, financial volatility persists, with BCRP policies aiming at mitigating it. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 1.85 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 3.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on February 10, 2022."
Romania,2022-01-10,"The Board of the National Bank of Romania, having convened for the meeting of 10 January 2022, decided:. The annual inflation rate climbed to 7.94 percent in October 2021, from 6.29 percent in September, before falling to 7.80 percent in November under the impact of the capping and compensation of electricity and natural gas prices for households, thus mildly exceeding the forecast at the end of the first two months of Q4. Its increase continued to be mainly driven by exogenous CPI components, with major influences coming in this period especially from the hefty hike in the prices of fuels, i.e. the non-petrol-diesel subgroup, and to a smaller extent from higher VFE prices. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate further rose somewhat faster than anticipated, up from 3.6 percent in September to 4.0 percent in October and 4.3 percent in November. This reflected the effects of the surge in agri-food commodity prices and energy and transport costs, as well as the influences of persistent bottlenecks in production and supply chains, alongside those arising from measures to protect against COVID-19, all compounded by increasingly higher short-term inflation expectations. Average annual CPI inflation rate and average annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices went up to 4.5 percent and 3.7 percent respectively in November, from 3.6 percent and 2.9 percent respectively in September 2021. Economic growth slowed down considerably in 2021 Q3, to 0.4 percent from 1.5 percent in Q2, contrary to expectations. This makes it likely for excess aggregate demand to shrink in this period to a much lower-than-forecasted value, also due to the recent notable downward revision of statistical data on the pace of economic advance in 2021 H1, which implies as well that in Q2 the pre-pandemic GDP level was surpassed by a relatively more modest margin. Moreover, annual GDP dynamics saw in Q3 a visibly stronger-than-anticipated decline, i.e. to 7.4 percent from 13.9 percent in Q2, while remaining however high from a historical perspective, mainly on the back of private consumption, but also of the unusually large contribution made, in this period as well, by the change in inventories. On the other hand, the contribution of gross fixed capital formation unexpectedly turned marginally negative for the first time in the past 11 quarters, mainly on account of a sharper contraction in capital repair works, which outweighed the impact of the slight annual increases in new construction works and net investments in equipment (transport equipment included). Net exports further made a negative contribution to annual GDP dynamics, yet this narrowed notably versus the previous quarter, even amid a somewhat faster decline in the annual change in exports of goods and services than that in imports thereof. However, trade deficit deepened in annual terms at a much stronger pace in Q3, given the relatively more unfavourable developments in the prices of imported goods, while the current account deficit continued to see a slowdown in the annual growth rate, albeit much more modest than in Q2, due to improved annual rates of change of income balances. Recent developments in high-frequency indicators point to a standstill in economic activity in 2021 Q4, also in the context of the fourth pandemic wave, the energy crisis and supply bottlenecks, entailing the fall in annual GDP dynamics to a significantly lower value than that anticipated in November 2021. Among the relevant developments were the significant deceleration seen in October by the annual growth rates of retail trade, sales of motor vehicles and market services to households and the plunge in industrial output and in the portfolio of manufacturing orders versus the same year-ago period. At the same time, the volume of construction works posted a faster year-on-year decline in October owing to developments in the non-residential segment and civil engineering works, whereas exports of goods and services recorded a considerable drop in their annual change, much more pronounced than that in import dynamics, which led to a further step-up in the annual increase in trade deficit. Against this background, but also as a result of a renewed notable worsening of income balances, the current account deficit saw its widening trend in annual terms re-accelerate strongly, its cumulative value for the first 10 months of 2021 exceeding by around 58 percent that reported in the same year-earlier period. September through October 2021, labour market developments reflected the influences from the worsening epidemiological situation and tighter mobility restrictions, as well as from more severe disruptions in global supply chains and sharp increases in energy and other commodity costs. Thus, the number of employees economy-wide ceased to rise in September and went up marginally in October, very slightly exceeding the pre-pandemic level. Moreover, in September, the unemployment rate reversed only part of the significant increases seen in the previous two months, while in October it remained unchanged, hence staying visibly above pre-pandemic values. Looking at the financial market, the main interbank money market rates went further up at a relatively fast pace in November and December 2021, hitting 21-month highs, following the new policy rate hike, as well as amid tight liquidity conditions and expectations on a further increase in the key rate, strengthened also by developments in the region. Yields on government securities continued to rise as well, albeit at a relatively slower pace, also in the context of abating political tensions and the mixed behaviour of long-term government bond yields in the advanced and emerging economies, remaining significantly above those in the region across the entire maturity spectrum. At this juncture, the EUR/RON exchange rate stayed relatively stable at the higher readings recorded at the end of 2021 Q3. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector rose further in double-digit territory October through November, reaching 14.1 percent on average, against 12.9 percent in Q3, given the protracted increase in the particularly strong dynamics of the leu-denominated component, supported, inter alia, by government programmes, but also on account of a mild step-up in forex loans. Leu-denominated loans saw their annual growth rate accelerate to 18.5 percent in this period, from 17.8 percent in Q3, with their share in total widening to 72.0 percent in November. According to current assessments, the annual inflation rate is likely to rise gradually over the months ahead, under the impact of supply-side shocks, exceeding the values shown over this time horizon by the medium-term forecast last November. Behind the worsening of the short-term inflation outlook stand the expected higher increases in electricity and natural gas prices  even amid the implementation of measures to compensate and cap such hikes  as well as in processed food prices, mainly due to the advance in energy and agri-food commodity prices. Their impact is likely to amplify and further prolong the positive deviation of the annual inflation rate from the upper bound of the variation band of the target, especially after the measures to compensate and cap energy price increases cease, but also to trigger disinflationary base effects over the longer time horizon. However, significant uncertainties still linger over the effects of temporary measures to compensate and cap price hikes for electricity and natural gas for households, as well as over how they will be assessed and included in the CPI calculation. Moreover, uncertainties and risks continue to stem from developments in commodity prices, particularly of energy and agri-food, as well as from bottlenecks in global production and supply chains. At the same time, the evolution of the pandemic and the ensuing containment measures remains a major source of uncertainties and risks to the forecast, over the short term at least, amid the nationwide expansion trend of the pandemic wave entailed by the more contagious Omicron variant, as well as given the insufficient progress of vaccination domestically, and because of the potential impact of this wave on Europe’s economies, which are also hit hard by the energy crisis and the persistent supply bottlenecks. Uncertainties and risks also continue to be associated with the fiscal policy stance, given, on the one hand, the 2021 government deficit potentially smaller than the target and, on the other hand, the co-ordinates of the budget programme approved for this year, aiming at a step-up in fiscal consolidation, in line with the commitments under the excessive deficit procedure, yet in a challenging economic and social environment domestically and globally. A source of uncertainties and risks remains also the absorption of EU funds  especially those under the Next Generation EU programme  that is conditional on fulfilling strict milestones and targets for implementing the approved projects. In the meeting held today, 10 January 2022, based on the currently available data and assessments, and in light of the elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 2.00 percent per annum, from 1.75 percent per annum, as of 11 January 2022, and to maintain firm control over money market liquidity. Moreover, the NBR Board decided to extend the symmetric corridor of interest rates on standing facilities around the policy rate to ±1.00 percentage point from ±0.75 percentage points, implying that the lending (Lombard) facility rate will be raised to 3.00 percent per annum, from 2.50 percent per annum, while the deposit facility rate will be kept at 1.00 percent per annum. These decisions are circumscribed to the process of gradual normalisation of the monetary policy conduct that the NBR is carrying out, amid high uncertainties. At the same time, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to bring back and maintain the annual inflation rate in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat inflation target, inter alia via the anchoring of inflation expectations over the longer time horizon, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth in the context of the fiscal consolidation process, while safeguarding financial stability. The NBR closely monitors developments in the domestic and international environment and stands ready to use the tools at its disposal to achieve the fundamental objective of price stability in the medium term. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today’s meeting will be posted on the NBR’s website on 20 January 2022 at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 9 February 2022."
Armenia,2022-01-11,"PRESS RELEASE 01.11.2022 Refinancing Rate Set at 10.5% At the November 1, 2022 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) decided to raise the refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage points, setting it to 10.5%. In September, 2022, the 12-month inflation rose amounting to 9.9%. The 12-month core inflation also increased, reaching 10.5%. Slowing trends of economic activity are observed in the global economy. The central banks of advanced countries continue to significantly tighten monetary conditions. This is expressed by a certain drop in prices in international commodity markets, however, headline inflation in the main partner countries of Armenia is still high. Notwithstanding certain recovery in supply chains, risks related to their disruptions in individual markets remain. As a result, weak inflationary effects on the Armenian economy from the global economy are expected. In the third quarter of 2022, the trends of high activity in the Armenian economy are persisting. The economic growth primarily bears the positive effects of external demand, reflected as a significant increase in the services sector. Continued increase in the inflow of international visitors and money transfers from the Russian Federation contributes to the expanding of demand. This is also expressed in the improvement in Armenia's external balance position and dram exchange rate appreciation. High demand also contributes to the heating of labor market, the expanse of overall inflationary environment and persistence of high inflation expectations. In current circumstances, the conduct of contractionary and coordinated fiscal and monetary policy is important. In the current situation, the Board of the CBA finds it appropriate to raise the policy rate. A relatively tightening monetary policy and the dram appreciation will gradually contribute to containing demand and reducing inflationary expectations. The Board of the CBA will be consistent in taking adequate actions to stabilize inflation and absorb any risk of de- anchoring inflation expectations. In accordance with the monetary policy scenario, the 12-month inflation will gradually decrease and stabilize around the 4% target in the medium run. The Board of the CBA estimates that the risks of inflation deviating from the projected path are mainly balanced; should such risks materialize in either direction, the CBA will respond accordingly to fulfil of the price stability objective. Detailed information about setting of the interest rate level will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by November 15, 2022."
South Korea,2022-01-14,"The bank of korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.00% to 1.25%. Currently available information suggests that the global economy has continued to recover despite the spread of a new coronavirus variant, as economic activity has not contracted significantly, supported by accelerated vaccinations. In global financial markets, government bond yields and stock prices in major countries have rebounded after having declined, affected by developments related to COVID-19 and changes in expectations about monetary policy in major countries. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by COVID-19 developments and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by global inflation movements and monetary policy changes in major countries. The Korean economy has continued to recover despite the resurgence of COVID-19. Although the improvement in private consumption has moderated owing to the tightening of domestic COVID-19 restrictions, exports have sustained their buoyancy thanks to robust global demand. Facilities investment has somewhat slowed due to global supply constraints. Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with a sustained trend of increase in the number of persons employed. Going forward, the economy is likely to sustain its sound growth, as the recovery of private consumption is forecast to pick up again while exports are expected to continue their solid trend of increase. GDP growth this year is projected to be around 3%, consistent with the forecast in November. Consumer price inflation has risen to the upper-3% level due to the ongoing sharp rise in the prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products, as well as the accelerating increase in the prices of non-petroleum industrial products and personal services. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has run at the lower-2% level and the inflation expectations of the general public have run at the mid- to upper-2% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will continue to run in the 3% range for a considerable time, exceeding the path projected in November, and above the mid-2% level for the year overall. Core inflation is forecast to run considerably above 2% this year. In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates fell due to concerns over the resurgence of COVID-19 but have rebounded affected by the rise in US Treasury yields. The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate rose considerably, due mainly to the prospect of accelerating monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, but then decreased. Stock prices have fallen slightly. The amount of increase in household loans has lessened, and the increase in housing prices has somewhat moderated in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board will appropriately adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation as the Korean economy is expected to continue its sound growth and inflation to run above the target level for a considerable time, despite underlying uncertainties over the virus. In this process the Board will judge when to further adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to COVID-19, changes in the pace of growth and inflation, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, the effects of the Base Rate raises, and monetary policy changes in major countries."
Malaysia,2022-01-20,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 1.75 percent. The global economy continues to recover, supported by manufacturing and trade activity. Labour market conditions have also improved in many countries. However, several countries reintroduced measures to curb ongoing COVID-19 resurgences, causing some moderation in the pace of recovery in domestic activity, especially services. Inflation remains elevated in a number of countries, driven by both supply and demand factors. Going forward, continued progress in vaccination coverage, advancements in vaccine efficacy, and the availability of anti-viral treatments will allow for better management of the pandemic, hence supporting global growth prospects. The global growth outlook will continue to be affected by uncertainties over the emergence of new variants of concern, risks of prolonged global supply disruptions, and risks of heightened financial market volatility amid adjustments in monetary policy in major economies. For Malaysia, the latest high-frequency indicators show that economic activity rebounded in the fourth quarter, in line with the relaxation of containment measures. For 2021, growth will be within the projected range of 3% - 4%. Looking ahead, growth is expected to gain further momentum in 2022. This will be driven by the expansion in global demand and higher private sector expenditure amid improvements in the labour market and continued policy support. Risks to the growth outlook, however, remain tilted to the downside. Such risks may arise from a weaker-than-expected global growth, a worsening in supply chain disruptions, and the emergence of severe and vaccine-resistant COVID-19 variants of concern. Headline inflation has averaged 2.3% for the period January-November 2021. For 2022, average headline inflation is likely to remain moderate as the base effect from fuel inflation dissipates. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to edge upwards as economic activity normalises amid the environment of high input costs. Nevertheless, core inflation is expected to be modest, with upside risk contained by the continued slack in the economy and labour market. The outlook, however, continues to be subject to global commodity price developments amid risks from prolonged supply-related disruptions. The MPC considers the current stance of monetary policy to be appropriate and accommodative. Fiscal and financial measures will continue to cushion the economic impact on businesses and households and provide support to economic activity. The stance of monetary policy will continue to be determined by new data and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth. Bank Negara Malaysia 20 January 2022."
Turkiye,2022-01-20,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 14 percent. The new variants and increasing geopolitical risks keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive and increases the uncertainty. Recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. While the effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation on the back of rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand may last longer than previously anticipated. Accordingly, while monetary policy communication of central banks in advanced economies varies with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs. Level of capacity utilization and other leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of robust external demand. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, current account balance is expected to post a surplus in 2022. Strengthening of the improvement trend in current account balance is important for price stability objective, and in that respect, developments in commercial and consumer loans are closely monitored. Increase in inflation in the recent period has been driven by distorted pricing behavior due to unhealthy price formations in the foreign exchange market, supply side factors such as the rise in global food and agricultural commodity prices, supply constraints, and demand developments. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken for sustainable price and financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the base effect. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. While cumulative impact of the recent policy decisions is being monitored, to create a foundation for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework is being conducted with the aim of prioritizing Turkish lira in all policy tools of the CBRT. The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2022-01-20,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to raise the key policy rate to 10% per annum. As many of the pro-inflationary risks have materialized, tighter monetary policy is needed in order to improve inflation expectations and ensure steady disinflation toward the target of 5%. Having peaked in autumn 2021, inflation has been declining. However, the decline has been slower than expected, and the underlying inflationary pressure has even increased. Inflation declined at the end of the year thanks to the record-high harvest and a correction of some global food prices, the strengthening of the hryvnia in the previous months, the vanished low base effect, and monetary policy tightening. Inflation was also restrained by administrative decisions to fix tariffs on some utility services. As a result, consumer inflation slowed from a peak of 11% in September to 10% in December. At the same time, a faster disinflation was prevented by a further increase in global energy prices, which passed through to prices of goods and services, and by pressures from other production costs, including labor costs. Robust consumer demand also continued to play a role. In particular, this spurred core inflation further, to 7.9% as of the end of the year. Inflation will slow in 2022 but will return to the 5% target only in 2023. The NBU has downgraded its 2022 inflation forecast, from 5% to 7.7%, considering the materialization of a number of pro-inflationary factors. In particular, global energy prices will remain high for longer than expected. Not only will it put pressure on businesses' production costs, but will also require at least a gradual correction of utility tariffs. Price pressures from trading partner countries, in which inflation is only approaching its peak, will remain strong. Second-round effects from businesses' larger raw material expenses and labor costs will persist. An increase in demand for Ukrainian labor force, both inside the country and abroad, and qualification mismatches on the labor market will impact the growth in wages more than expected. With household income rising, consumer demand will remain robust, which will also restrain disinflation. Moreover, a deterioration in the information environment amid geopolitical tensions that occurred late last year affected the sentiment of various groups of economic agents, putting a depreciation pressure on the hryvnia. Through exchange rate and expectations channels, this will create additional pressures on prices in the coming months. Monetary policy tightening by the NBU, a correction of global commodity prices, and the influence of last year's bumper crops will foster a gradual disinflation. It will be additionally driven by the easing of the global inflation surge and the waning effects of the pandemic, reflected, among other things in a larger correction of prices for raw materials, food, and logistical services. The NBU tightening its monetary policy will also contribute to a decline in the underlying inflationary pressure. Core inflation is expected to slow to 4% in the coming years, with the administrative component making the largest contribution to the increase in consumer basket prices. At the same time, inflation will be quite volatile in 2022 due to base effects. In addition, like in many other countries, the rise in inflation in Ukraine will last longer than expected. Taking into account the strong pro-inflationary factors and the need to continue supporting the post-pandemic economic recovery, inflation is projected to return to the target range of 5%±1 pp in mid-2023, given the monetary conditions envisaged under the baseline scenario. GDP growth will accelerate somewhat, to 3.4% in 2022. However, high energy prices and the information environment around geopolitical tensions will restrain the economy from recovering more rapidly. Real GDP grew by about 3% in 2021, by NBU estimates. The economic recovery was driven by sustained consumer demand, increased investment by businesses after the crisis, a record harvest of crops. However, the recovery came out slower than expected. This was in part due to a spike in energy prices and shortages, the impact of weak 2020 harvests, a slower recovery in the services sector, the limited production capacity of some manufacturing sectors, more significant losses from the pandemic, and a faster fiscal consolidation. The forecast of real GDP growth for 2022 has been revised to 3.4% from 3.8%. The growth will be underpinned by consumer demand and still rather favorable terms of trade. On the other hand, the tense geopolitical situation will remain a significant deterrent that will adversely affect investment decisions. In addition, despite the gradual retreat of the pandemic, the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis will remain quite significant. Relatively high energy prices and shortages of certain raw materials, especially in the first half of the year, will also limit growth potential. In 20232024, real GDP growth will accelerate to about 4% per year. This will be driven by the stabilization of geopolitical conditions during 2022, the fading of the fallout from COVID-19, further growth in the global economy, and the persistence of rather benign terms of trade. It is due to favorable terms of trade that the current account deficit in 2021 was relatively small. However, it will continue to widen moderately as domestic demand increases. The current account ran only a moderate deficit (1.9% of GDP) in 2021. This was made possible by high global prices for food and metals-and-mining products, which are Ukraine's major exports. Yet this deficit widened rapidly in the second half of the year because of surging energy prices, weaker external demand for metals-and-mining products, and record-high dividend payments. As domestic demand from both consumers and investors revives, the current account deficit will expand further to 3.3% of GDP in 2022 and to 3.3%3.5% of GDP thereafter. Further progress on cooperation with the IMF will be one of the main drivers of more sustainable economic development. IMF financing was a significant catalyst of the Ukrainian economy in 20202021. Cooperation with the IMF stands to be at least as important in the years ahead, especially against a deteriorating information backdrop as geopolitical tensions loom large and competition for capital between EMs and other countries intensifies amid the tighter monetary policies pursued by central banks around the globe. Under the baseline scenario of the macroeconomic forecast, the monetary policy stance will remain moderately tight over the forecast horizon. The key policy rate will be at least at its neutral level this year and in the coming years. In addition, to shore up the interest rate channel of monetary transmission by managing the structural surplus of liquidity in the banking system, the NBU in February will raise by 2 pp the required reserve ratio for current accounts denominated in hryvnias and current accounts and term deposits in foreign currency. This will encourage banks to take longer-term deposits while maintaining the role of required reserves in dedollarization. In March, the central bank will also consider the issue of introducing other measures to regulate the banking system's structural liquidity surplus. The NBU will continue to intervene in the FX market to smooth out excessive market fluctuations. At the same time, the NBU decided, in the coming quarters, not to carry out scheduled daily interventions to purchase FX on the interbank FX market to replenish the reserves (from August 2021 these interventions amounted to USD 5 million). Key risks to the forecast are still posed by an escalation of the military conflict with Russia and a longer and more pronounced global price surge than expected earlier. The stoking of tensions in the media regarding the possibility of military aggression has decreased the value of Ukrainian assets and created depreciation pressures. Prolonged geopolitical tensions could have a very negative impact on the expectations of households, businesses and investors. These tensions will significantly hamper investment into the economy, while also making it difficult to raise external financing. If geopolitical risks increase, the NBU will stand ready to tighten its monetary policy. The ongoing global spike in inflation, due to, among other things, persistently high energy and food prices, remains an important risk. In some countries, including Ukraine's trading partners, inflation is only coming close to its peak. Looking ahead, global price movements will strongly depend on how quickly leading central banks respond to inflation challenges. Any delays will push up external price pressures. Conversely, a rapid tightening of monetary policies by leading central banks poses the risk of there being more substantial capital outflows from emerging markets. The baseline scenario of the NBU's forecast assumes that the impact of the pandemic on the Ukrainian economy will continue to decrease. That said, the emergence of new coronavirus variants, coupled with the still low vaccination rollout in Ukraine, poses the risk of additional economic losses in 2022. New pandemic outbreaks are unlikely to hit consumer demand hard, but will stifle business activity. This will be accompanied by rising inflationary pressures. Other pro-inflationary risks are also important. More specifically, a marked deterioration in terms of trade and/or a sharp decline in harvests after last year's bumper ones could create additional depreciation pressures, while also putting greater pressures on prices. A revival in labor migration, on the back of the gradually waning pandemic, could increase the mismatches on the domestic labor market, pushing up wage costs more noticeably and translating into rising consumer prices over time. The speed at which administered prices change poses a separate risk. A one-off adjustment of utility prices to cost covering levels will remove imbalances in the energy sector, but will create significant inflationary pressures and worsen expectations. In contrast, any delays in taking decisions regarding utility prices will accumulate quasi-fiscal imbalances and future pressures on prices. The NBU continues to assess the balance of risks for its baseline forecast for inflation and the key policy rate as having shifted upward, especially in the medium term. In view of the above, the NBU will continue its monetary policy tightening cycle and stands ready to act decisively if pro-inflationary factors continue to materialize. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the central bank's Inflation Report on 27 January 2022. A summary of the discussion between Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 31 January 2022. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 3 March 2022, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
Kazakhstan,2022-01-24,"Press-Release 2 The base rate was raised to 10.25% January 24, 2022 Nur-Sultan The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to set the base rate at 10.25% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1.00 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities set on 11.25% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 9.25%. The decision was made due to the need to reduce inflation expectations and inflation entry into the established target range of 4-6% by the end of 2022. In most economies of the world, including the countries-the main trading partners of Kazakhstan, inflation continues to be at elevated levels. The internal conjuncture, despite the presence of disinflationary processes in recent months, is characterized by the presence of significant pro-inflationary risks both on the demand side and on the supply side. Inflation in the world's largest economies and major trading partner countries remains at high values. In the United States, for the first time since 1982, inflation rose to 7.0%. Consumer inflation in the EU in December 2021 rose to 5.3%, in Germany - for the first time since 1992 to 5.7%. In China, price growth reached a 15-month high in November 2021 (2.3%), then declined to 1.5% in December 2021. In Russia, inflation in December 2021 remained at the same high level - 8.4%. There is a slight slowdown in price growth on the world food market. The FAO food price index in December 2021 decreased by 0.9% compared to the previous month (growth in November  1.3%) because of lower prices for all subgroups of food products, except for dairy products. At the same time, in annual terms, the growth of the index was 23.1% (annual growth in November  27.8%). According to the estimates of the National Bank, in the 1st half of 2022, amid the uncertainty in food markets and a weak wheat harvest in the northern hemisphere, prices are expected to rise in certain segments of the world food market, further within the situation of COVID-19 stabilization and the beginning of a new agricultural season, the growth rate will gradually slow down. In Kazakhstan, annual inflation decreased to 8.4% in December 2021. Under the implementation of anti-inflationary response measures, the monthly price growth rates in November- December 2021 were lower than the historical average. Food inflation in December 2021 decreased significantly and amounted to 9.9% in annual terms. This is due to the implementation of anti-inflationary response measures and the release of high monthly values for certain food products from the calculation of annual inflation. Annual inflation is observed for dairy products, eggs, butter, sugar and vegetables. Despite this, the annual growth rates of the cost of fruit and vegetable products still remain at high levels. By the end of 2021, the price increase for beetroot was 73%, cabbage - 37.5%, carrots - 29.5%, potatoes - 20.2% in annual terms. There is an acceleration in annual inflation for meat, bakery products and cereals, as well as soft drinks. A significant slowdown in food inflation is accompanied by an acceleration of the non-food component to 8.5% by the end of December 2021. The current high value of annual non-food inflation is observed for the first time since May 2018. The main contribution is made by the increase in prices for fuel and lubricants (23.2%), cars (14.7%) and solid fuel (9.5%), including coal (9.8%). The annual increase in gasoline prices accelerated to 19.6%, diesel fuel - by 46.5%. The annual inflation of paid services in December 2021 slowed to 6.5% (October 2021 - 6.9%. December 2020 - 4.2%) amid the more moderate increase in prices for regulated utilities, hairdressing salons, restaurants, and hotels. The growth of tariffs for regulated utilities slowed slightly to 4.1% as a result of lower tariffs for central heating and hot water. At the same time, the growth rate still exceeds the level of December 2020. The active growth of the cost of renting housing continues (19.8% in December 2021). Also, due to increased demand in December 2021, there was a sharp increase in prices for certain types of transport services. The trajectory of core inflation indicates the instability of the slowdown in inflationary processes. Various estimates of core inflation after slowing down in August-November 2021 again demonstrate acceleration in December 2021, having formed above the target corridor. This is due to the high rise in prices for unregulated goods and services. Inflation expectations, despite a slight decrease, remain at an elevated level. In December 2021, the quantitative estimate of inflation for the year ahead was 10.3%. The majority of respondents (66%) still expect the current price growth to continue or accelerate in the next 12 months. Among them, the share of those expecting further price growth has slightly decreased from the historical maximum level of 35% in November to 31% in December 2021. Consumer demand continued to maintain a positive trend, as evidenced by the dynamics of retail trade and consumer imports. Retail trade turnover from January to November 2021 maintained a positive trend, amounting to 6.5% in the first 11 months of 2021. In 2021, non-food products made a significant positive contribution to the retail trade turnover, in addition, since the middle of the year, there has been a recovery in the turnover of food products. The pent-up demand realization and the dynamic growth of trade turnover was accompanied by double-digit growth rates of consumer imports, which grew by 21.8% in the first 11 months of 2021. Household consumption in 2021 was supported by the realization of pent-up demand and an increase in real incomes of the population. According to the results of January-November 2021, the growth of real incomes amounted to 3.1%. Some adjustment to the further dynamics of demand was made by the state of emergency in the country, as well as the observed increase in cases of infection with the Omicron strain. A significant increase in the money supply as a result of the implementation of state programs to support the economy leads to pro-inflationary pressure in the economy and has a negative impact on the stability of the foreign exchange market. The implementation of these programs accelerated the economic recovery to the pre-pandemic level, but at the same time led to the expansion of the monetary base from the beginning of 2020 by 1.6 times to 11.0 trillion tenge, the money supply increased by 41.2% to 30.1 trillion tenge over the same period. To reduce the impact of this factor on inflation, the National Bank has already started withdrawing from state programs to support the economy, having completed financing 5 of them in 2021 (the Program of preferential lending to entrepreneurs, the Employment Roadmap. Nurly Zher, the Program of preferential car loans and the mortgage program ""Baspana Hit""). In 2022, it is planned to complete the financing of the program ""Economics of simple things"" and the mortgage program ""7-20-25"". The current situation on the world oil market, despite the spread of the virus, is assessed as moderately positive. In December 2021, the price of Brent crude oil rose by 10.2% to $77.8 per barrel amid positive expectations for demand in the hydrocarbon market, a decline in global oil reserves and a restrained increase in production by OPEC+ countries. As a result, the average oil price for 2021 was $70.9 per barrel. On January 4, 2022. OPEC+ decided to continue increasing production by the planned 400 thousand barrels per day in February 2022. While maintaining the current pace of expansion, the restrictions adopted in 2020 may be completely lifted by the end of September 2022. OPEC+ expects that the spread of the Omicron strain will have less impact on global demand than previously expected. Amid the stronger demand and supply disruptions as a result of an attack by rebels from Yemen on the UAE oil infrastructure in January this year, the price of Brent crude oil exceeded $89 per barrel. However, in recent days, the price of oil has adjusted to $87 per barrel after a slight increase in oil reserves in the United States. According to the updated EIA estimates, the oil price for 2022 has been increased from 70.1 to 75 US dollars per barrel. It is expected that the average monthly oil price during the year will gradually decrease from 78-79 to 70 US dollars per barrel by the end of the year. Despite the high rates of infection with the Omicron strain and a record daily increase in new cases in the world (3.77 million people per day according to WHO data as of January 20 this year), the new strain is characterized by a lower level of hospitalization and mortality, which reduced market concerns and led to a recovery in energy prices. Due to the growth of inflationary processes, developed economies continue to tighten their policies. In 2021, 78% of all decisions of the world's central banks were aimed at tightening monetary conditions. To stabilize the growth of consumer prices, the head of the Federal Reserve at the US Senate hearing said that they were going to stop buying assets in March 2022. Against this background, market participants expect 3-4 rate hikes during 2022 starting from March this year. Due to increased inflation, the ECB will soon also stop buying some assets. As a result, expectations for tightening global monetary conditions are already leading to an outflow of non-residents from government securities of the Republic of Kazakhstan from a peak of 863 billion tenge in October 2021 to 596 billion tenge in December 2021. At the same time, the data for the first 2 weeks of this year indicate that the share of non-residents in the NBK notes decreased from 10.5% on January 6 this year to 7.4% on January 14 this year. The World Bank estimates that global consumer price inflation will peak in the first half of 2022, and then gradually decrease during 2023. The slowdown in global growth and the expansion of commodity supplies will contribute to the reduction of inflation in the world. Given the development of the situation in the global economy and current internal factors in Kazakhstan, according to the updated forecast, the National Bank expects a further slowdown in inflation to the level of 6-6.5% by the end of 2022. At the same time, due to the tragic events in Kazakhstan at the beginning of January this year and the relatively low base of the 1st half of 2021, an increase in inflationary processes is possible, the main pressure of which will fall on the 1st quarter of this year. In the 2nd half of this year after expiration (180 days) measures of temporary regulation of prices for socially important food products, fuel and utilities may increase the risks of accelerating inflation. Based on the current balance of risks, the inflation slowdown instability at the end of 2021, including due to the acceleration of the non-food component, as well as increased inflation expectations, the National Bank continues to tighten monetary policy. Along with the effective implementation of the Set of measures being developed by the Government to control inflation, the disinflationary monetary policy of the National Bank will reduce inflation in accordance with the target set for 2022  4-6%. The next planned decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on March 9, 2022 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time.

Pakistan,2022-01-24,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement January 24, 2022. At today's meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the policy rate at.75 percent, in line with the forward guidance provided in the last monetary policy statement. At that time, the MPC had considered the measures taken to lower inflation and keep the ongoing economic recovery sustainable. These measures include cumulative 275 basis point increase in the policy rate, higher bank cash reserve requirements, regulatory tightening of consumer finance, and curtailment of non-essential imports. Since the last meeting on 14th December 2021, several developments suggest that these demand- moderating measures are gaining traction and have improved the outlook for inflation. Recent economic growth indicators are appropriately moderating to more sustainable pace. While year-on-year headline inflation is high and will likely remain so in the near term due to base effects and energy prices, the momentum in inflation has slowed with month-on-month inflation flat in December compared to significant rise of percent in November. Inflation expectations of businesses have also declined considerably. The current account deficit appears to have stopped growing since November and the non-oil current account balance is expected to achieve small surplus for FY22. Finally and importantly, the enactment of the recent Finance (Supplementary) Act, 2022 represents significant additional fiscal consolidation compared to the budget and has lowered the outlook for inflation in FY23. Looking ahead, and against the backdrop of these developments that have improved the inflation outlook, the MPC was of the view that current real interest rates on forward-looking basis are appropriate to guide inflation to the medium-term range of 5-7 percent, support growth, and maintain external stability. If future data outturns require fine-tuning of monetary policy settings, the MPC expected that any change would be relatively modest. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Real sector. The economic recovery underway over the last 18 months continues, with its pace moderating from rebased estimate of. percent in FY21. Since the last meeting, year-on-year growth rates of several high- frequency demand indicators either stabilized or slowed, including cement dispatches and sales of petroleum products, tractors and commercial vehicles. On the supply side. LSM production decelerated to. percent (y/y) in July-November 2021, partly reflecting high base-effect as well as higher input costs, while electricity generation stabilized. Similarly there has been some easing in the momentum of imports and tax revenue growth. Prospects remain favourable in agriculture, with an improved Rabi crop outlook offsetting reports of lower cotton output. Overall growth in FY22 is expected around the middle of the forecast range of 4-5 percent, slightly lower than previous expectations in light of moderating demand indicators and higher base effects from the upward revision in last year's growth rate. Risks to the outlook include, on the domestic front, the current growing Omicron wave and, on the external front, the possibility of faster than anticipated tightening by the US Federal Reserve and geopolitical events in Europe that may have implications for global financial conditions. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN External sector. Through the first half of FY22, the current account deficit has reached $9 billion. Based on PBS data, imports rose to $40. billion, up around 6 percent (y/y), with energy imports and Covid vaccines accounting for more than half the rise. Encouragingly imports excluding energy and vaccines have stabilized in the last two months. Exports grew by nearly 25 percent (y/y) to reach $15. billion, buoyed by record-high shipments of textiles as well as strong rice exports. Meanwhile remittances rose by 1. percent (y/y) to an all-time high of $15. billion during the first half of the fiscal year. Looking ahead, the current account deficit is expected to decline through the remainder of FY22, as import growth slows in response to normalization of global commodity prices and the fuller impact of demand-moderating measures. Indeed the non-oil current account deficit is less than one-fourth the record levels reached during the first half of FY18. The current account projection is subject to risks on both sides. On the one hand, the deficit could be larger if global commodity prices take longer to normalize. On the other, it could be smaller if the fiscal consolidation associated with the Finance (Supplementary) Act has faster and more pronounced impact on demand. Fiscal sector. During the first half of FY22. FBR tax collections grew strongly by 32. percent (y/y). As result, the fiscal deficit shrank to. percent of GDP during July-October FY22, compared to. percent of GDP during the same period last year. The primary surplus also improved by. percentage points to. percent of GDP. Looking ahead, with the passage of the Finance (Supplementary) Act that withdraws certain tax exemptions, the fiscal deficit is projected to be around. percent of GDP lower than previously expected for FY22. Together with recent policy rate increases and accounting for the usual lagged impact of fiscal measures, this additional fiscal consolidation should help further moderate the pace of domestic demand growth, and thus improve the outlook for inflation and the current account in FY23. Monetary and inflation outlook. During the first half of FY22, private sector credit cumulatively grew by 13. percent, largely driven by increased demand for working capital loans especially by rice, textile, petroleum and steel industries. Since the last meeting, both short and long-term secondary market yields, benchmark rates and cut-off rates in the government's auctions declined significantly, in line with the forward guidance provided by the MPC and the conduct of 2-month open market operations by the SBP. While headline and core inflation rose in December, both the sequential momentum of inflation and inflation expectations of businesses fell significantly. Together with low base effects, one-off cost-push pressures from energy tariff increases and the removal of tax exemptions in the Finance (Supplementary) Act are likely to keep year-on-year inflation elevated over the next few months, close to the upper end of the average inflation forecast of 9-11 percent in FY22. However during FY23, inflation is expected to decline toward the medium-term target range of 5-7 percent more quickly than previously forecasted as demand-side pressures wane faster due to the Finance (Supplementary) Act and recent moderation in economic activity indicators. The MPC will continue to carefully monitor developments affecting medium-term prospects for inflation, financial stability, and growth. Page."
Nigeria,2022-01-25,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 140 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON MONDAY 24th AND TUESDAY 25th JANUARY, 2022 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held its first meeting for the year 2022 on the 24th and 25th of January 2022 in the light of waning optimism for a robust rebound in global recovery in 2021. This resulted from the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and emergence of new variants of the virus; persisting supply bottlenecks; global inflationary pressures; and the imminent commencement of monetary policy normalization by some major central banks. In the domestic economy, output growth recovery was relatively strong in 2021. It is however, expected to continue reasonably in 2022, following considerable improvement in the third quarter of 2021 and a positive outlook for the fourth quarter. This was hinged on the continued support of the monetary and fiscal authorities to sustain the current momentum. The Committee reviewed the developments in the global and domestic economic and financial environments in 2021, as well as the outlook and risks for 2022. Ten (10) members of the Committee attended this meeting. Global Economic Developments The Committee noted that while the recovery of the global economy in 2021 fell below the initial forecast, final estimates showed considerable improvements over the 2020 outcome, evidence that the global economy was pulling out of the doldrum associated with the pandemic. Consequently the recovery is gaining momentum with increasing consumer spending, upswing in investments and soaring world merchandise trade, above pre-pandemic levels. This reflects the resilience of economic agents in the face of new strains of the 1 virus and rising infection rates. The Committee, however, took cognizance of significant headwinds confronting the global economy in 2022, largely associated with the persisting threats of new variants of the coronavirus. The Advanced Economies are however, in a strong position to offset the impact of these headwinds with stronger policy support and better access to COVID-19 vaccines. Consequently this group of economies have shown better resilience towards disruptions to the recovery. In the medium term however, the rising inflationary pressures and the gradual withdrawal of both monetary and fiscal stimuli may dampen the recovery in 2022. In the Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs), poor access to vaccines and limited policy support meant that this group of economies have been harder hit by the Covid-19 health crisis and its associated macroeconomic downturn. In China, one of the few countries that stayed out of recession in 2020, output weakened in the third quarter of 2021 and has continued to weaken as the Covid infections continue to rage amid power supply shortages and a turbulent property market. Following the containment of the infections in India, the economy has commenced a sharp recovery and is set to continue on an upward trajectory. Overall growth in the EMDEs is expected to slow in 2022 due to the low level of vaccination and limited policy support in several economies in this group. On price development, the MPC observed that inflation, in most Advanced Economies remained high and unlikely to abate in the short to medium term. This is driven by the persistence of supply side disruptions and pent-up demand associated with economic recovery. In the EMDEs, inflation has remained high due to a combination of persisting exchange rate pressures and supply bottlenecks associated with the lockdown restrictions. With the US Fed and central banks of other advanced economies now moving towards monetary policy normalization, the eventual interest rate hike may likely trigger huge capital outflow from the EMDEs which will further aggravate exchange rate pressures with a pass-through to domestic prices. Global financial markets data show significant sell-off, as investors continued to rebalance their portfolios with the shift from assets such as gold and emerging market securities to securities of Advanced Economies suggesting market response to the impending interest rate hike. Thus global financial conditions are expected to tighten as risk averse portfolio investors reassign their portfolios from perceived riskier emerging market securities, to less risky advanced economy securities with the expectation of improved yields. Domestic Economic Developments Staff projections showed that the economy is expected to remain on a path of positive growth, given the impressive performance in the third quarter of 2021 and continuing rebound in economic activities. The Committee noted with satisfaction, the significant improvement in the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which rose to 520 index points in December 2021, compared with 508 index points in November reflecting the continuing economic recovery. This expansion was driven largely by increasing business activities in the economy, leading to increase in new orders and uptrend in employment and production levels. The Non-Manufacturing PMI, however, declined marginally to 480 index points in December 2021 from 486 points in November, largely reflecting a decline in services. The Committee noted with concern, the slight increase in headline inflation (year-on-year) to 1563 per cent in December 2021 from 1540 per cent in November following seven consecutive months of decline. The unexpected increase was attributed to both the food and core components, which rose to 1737 and 1387 per cent in December 2021 from 1721 and 1385 per cent in November, respectively. The Committee, however, expressed confidence in the Bank's sustained intervention programmes, noting that inflation will continue to abate as food supply improves. Members also noted that the seasonal drive in price development associated with the December festive period was largely contributory to the marginal increase in price levels, and as such, believe that this episode of increase may be temporary. Reviewing the developments in monetary aggregates, the Committee noted that broad money supply (M3) rose further to 1377 per cent in December 2021, compared with 1010 per cent in November 2021. This upthrust was largely driven by the growth in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of 1558 per cent in December 2021, compared with 940 per cent in November 2021. Net Foreign Assets (NFA), however decreased to 606 per cent in December 2021, compared with 1498 per cent in November 2021. The sharp growth in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) was largely attributed to an increase in claims on the Federal government and other sectors. The slowdown in growth of Net Foreign Assets (NFA) resulted from a decrease in foreign assets holdings of the banking system in favour of more domestic investments. The Committee reviewed the performance of the Bank's intervention programmes aimed at stimulating productivity in manufacturing/industries, agriculture, energy/infrastructure, healthcare and Micro. Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Between November and December 2021, under the Anchor Borrowers' Programme (ABP), the Bank disbursed N7599 billion to support the cultivation of over 383,,000 hectares of maize, rice and wheat during the 2022 dry season, bringing the cumulative disbursements under the Programme to ₦92794 billion to over 45 million smallholder farmers cultivating 21 commodities across the country. All excess output aggregated from the financed farmers will be released to the Nigeria Commodity Exchange (NCX) to help moderate the prices of food in the market. The Bank also released N176 billion to finance two large-scale agricultural projects under the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme (CACS). In addition, the Bank disbursed the sum of ₦15123 billion under the Real Sector Facility to 15 additional projects in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and services. The funds were utilized for both greenfield and brownfield (expansion) projects under the Covid-19 Intervention for the Manufacturing Sector (CIMS) and the Real Sector Support Facility from Differentiated Cash Reserve Requirement (RSSF-DCRR). Cumulative disbursements under the Real Sector 4 Facility currently stood at ₦140 trillion disbursed to 331 projects across the country. As part of its effort to support the resilience of the healthcare sector, the Bank also disbursed ₦49800 million to two healthcare projects under the Healthcare Sector Intervention Facility (HSIF), bringing the cumulative disbursements to ₦10885 billion for 118 projects, comprising of 31 pharmaceuticals, 82 hospital and 4 other services. To support households and businesses affected by Covid-19, the Bank disbursed N2029 billion to 40,,521 beneficiaries, comprising 35,,340 households and 5,,181 small businesses under the Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) within the period. The cumulative disbursements under the TCF stood at N36978 billion to 777,,666 beneficiaries, comprising 648,,052 households and 129,,614 small businesses. To further promote entrepreneurship development among Nigerian youths, the Bank disbursed N293 million to 59 beneficiaries under the recently introduced Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES). Under the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP), the sum of ₦4783 billion was disbursed for the procurement and installation of 858,,026 electricity meters across the country under the Scheme's Phase-0. The Committee also noted the improved collections by DisCos as a result of increased meter installations. The Bank released ₦27433 billion to power sector players, as part of its effort to support the sector under the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Payment Assurance Facility (NBET-PAF). This was in addition to the ₦2058 billion released to Distribution Companies (DisCos) under the Nigeria Electricity Market Stabilisation Facility – Phase 2 (NEMSF-2). To further support the development of enabling infrastructure in the gas industry, the Bank released additional ₦300 billion for the augmentation of an existing infrastructure, bringing the cumulative disbursements under the Intervention Facility for National Gas Expansion Programme (IFNGEP) to ₦4220 billion for six projects. Furthermore under the 100 for 100 Policy on Production and Productivity (PPP), which was introduced to stimulate the flow of finance and investments to enterprises and projects with potential to kick-start a sustainable economic 5 growth trajectory, accelerate structural transformation, promote diversification, and improve productivity, the Bank has received 224 applications, valued at ₦29491 billion for real sector projects in agriculture, energy, healthcare, manufacturing and services. The applications are currently being processed and the first batch of beneficiaries under the intervention will be announced on 31st January 2022, with their names published in national dailies. These projects have been carefully selected in line with the approved selection criteria as contained in the guidelinesq Money market rates fluctuated within and above the asymmetric corridor, reflecting prevailing liquidity conditions in the banking system. The monthly weighted average Open Buyback (OBB) rate increased to 1275 per cent in December 2021 from 1061 per cent in November 2021. The increase in the Open Buyback (OBB) rate reflected the tight liquidity conditions in the banking system. The MPC noted the continuing positive performance in the equities market in the review period, with the All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalization (MC) increasing by 161 and 163 per cent to 42,,71644 and N2230 trillion on December 31, 2021, from 42,,03860 and N2194 trillion on October 29, 2021, respectively. This positive performance reflected improved corporate earnings as investors participation increased in the market. The MPC also noted the sustained resilience of the banking system, following the progressive improvement in the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio from 510 per cent in November 2021 to 485 per cent in December 2021- a first in a long time. The Committee also noted that the liquidity ratio remained well above its prudential limit at 413 per cent, though Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) declined marginally to 1453 per cent in December 2021 from 1490 per cent in the previous month. The Committee thus, urged the Bank to sustain its firm regulatory surveillance. Members also noted the continued improvement in the external reserves despite ongoing foreign exchange market pressures. The reserves stood at US$4020 billion as at December 2021. Outlook The broad outlook for the recovery in both the global and domestic economies is clouded with uncertainty such as the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by new and mutating strains of the coronavirus; persisting supply bottlenecks; high and rising inflationary pressures; and dwindling monetary and fiscal stimuli. The Emerging Markets and Developing Economies are likely to experience a sharp downturn as a result of the identified headwinds confronting the outlook. This is hinged on the back of the ongoing two-speed recovery of the global economy, driven by continued disparities in the administration of vaccines between the Advanced Economies and the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies. While the Advanced Economies will also experience a downturn in 2022, this group of economies are expected to take a less severe hit as most of them have achieved significant high levels of vaccination. Staff forecast project output growth at 310 per cent in 2021 with an expected better outcome in 2022, consistent with the expected improved macroeconomic performance. The economic recovery is therefore expected to progress gradually with the ongoing support by the monetary and fiscal authorities, progress in COVID-19 vaccinations and continued high crude oil prices. After a moderate increase in December 2021, headline inflation is expected to trend marginally upwards in the short-term before moderating towards the end of the first quarter of 2022. This is expected as food harvests progress towards the end of the first quarter of 2022 and improve food supply. In general, with the Bank sustaining its intervention programmes through the year, food inflation is expected to trend downwards in 2022. Available forecasts for key macroeconomic variables for the Nigerian economy, indicated expected rebound in output growth for most of 2022, sustained by ongoing broad monetary and fiscal stimuli. Accordingly the Nigerian economy is forecast to grow in 2022 by 286 per cent (CBN), 420 per cent (FGN) and 276 per cent (IMF). The Committee's Considerations The Committee accessed the balance of risks confronting the domestic economy in the near term as they impact output growth and price stability. Members noted the unrelenting effort by the monetary and fiscal authorities in mitigating the impact of the virus on the economy. It observed the continued moderate recovery of the domestic economy but requires further concerted policy effort by both the monetary and fiscal authorities to improve the momentum and strengthen the recovery. Members were thus of the view that, building on the improved growth in the third quarter and the positive PMIs in the fourth quarter of 2021, output growth is expected to strengthen into 2022. On the Pandemic, the MPC reviewed its continued impact on the domestic economy as Members collectively agreed that the downside risks were still hindering the recovery. In this light, it commended the efforts of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 for procuring vaccines and continuing the drive to ensure that most Nigerians are fully vaccinated. On price development. Members continued to express concerns about the impact of insecurity in farming communities on food inflation. Whereas headline inflation had been moderating for several months, the committee believed that its recent uptick was associated with increased demand during the festive season and was thus of the view that prices will return to the downward trajectory given the Bank's ongoing interventions in the agriculture sector. On this note. Members applauded the efforts of the Bank with the recent launch of the rice pyramids, noting that these efforts to increase food supply and stem food inflation were in the right direction. Members however, reiterated the key 8 role of the Federal Government in providing the necessary security around the country, and particularly in the farming communities, to ensure that farmers and their produce remain safe, and food supply is both boosted and uninterrupted. The Committee noted that the ongoing dry season farming would further improve food supply and dampen prices. Members noted the ongoing debate around the removal of fuel subsidy and suggested a robust engagement with relevant groups in the country, and afterward follow a stepwise and gradual approach, to ensure its moderate impact on cost of transportation and energy for individual, households and firms. The Committee also noted the need to encourage the take-off of private refineries across the country to provide alternative competitive local supply source and reduce the need for government intervention to manage fuel prices for domestic consumption. In addition to this, the Committee called for the speedy conclusion of the government gas-powered vehicle conversion scheme and other alternative sources of fuel. On the exchange rate, the Committee applauded the Management's efforts at maintaining stability over the short term with increasing demand as the economy continues to reopen. Members noted the dwindling proceeds from oil sale, despite rising crude oil prices. They further noted the need to address the persistent reduction in remittance of oil revenue to the Consolidated Revenue Fund and urged the NNPC to urgently address this anomaly. The improved foreign exchange supply will thus support the Bank's demand management strategy in the foreign exchange market and consolidate macroeconomic performance, especially those that promote export, reduce dependence on import and reduce foreign exchange demand pressure. The MPC welcomed the improvement in foreign capital inflow through diaspora remittances and urged the Bank to further extend the incentive scope to attract more remittances to official channels. The Committee noted the rising government debt profile and the concentration of the funding sources and its implications for fiscal sustainability and 9 macroeconomic stability, including its impact on financial system performance and growth. The MPC continued to urge the Government on the need to harness other sources of revenue to reduce its dependence on oil as a single revenue source. In addition, it reiterated the need for government to seek alternative, more viable, and efficient infrastructure financing sources, in order to ease its expenditure burden. To this end. Members called on the fiscal authorities to take advantage of InfraCorp, the private sector driven infrastructural vehicle and transfer viable infrastructure projects for consideration by the Corporation as this would ease pressure on Government. that would otherwise have to raise revenue through taxes from an already burdened private and household sector. The improved performance of the equities market in the review period, signposted continued investor confidence in the Nigerian economy. This in the view of Members was a positive sign that the economy remained on a path to a more robust medium-term recovery. The banking sector indices, in the consideration of Members, showed no less resilience as other macroeconomic indicators reviewed; even as obvious downside risks associated with the Pandemic continued to impact the business environment. Members thus applauded the Management's efforts in ensuring the continued downward trend of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio, signifying improving conditions in the banking system. Nevertheless Members emphasized the need for the Bank to closely monitor developments in the sector and swiftly respond to any emerging challenges. The Committee's Decision The MPC observed with concern the moderate rise in inflation in December 2021, noting that this was typical of increased aggregate demand associated with the end of year festive activities. Members however, expressed their continued commitment to drive down domestic prices by putting in place 10 relevant policy measures to curb the rise in inflationary pressures, while also supporting the fragile growth recovery. In its determination as to whether to hold or loosen or tighten its policy stance, the MPC was mindful that, whereas the US and some Advanced Economies have signaled their intention to commence policy normalisation which may result in capital flow reversal for EMDEs, the major focus at these climes were targeted mainly at reining in the high level of inflation which had been unprecedent in the last four decades in those climes. For Nigeria, members were of the view that Nigeria is confronted with, not only inflation but also fragile output growth. As a result. MPC believes that its current stance of price and monetary stability conducive for growth remain desirable. The MPC is convinced that various measures being implemented were helping, not only in boosting output growth, but also in moderating inflation. The MPC therefore, enjoyed Management to continue to use its development finance tools to accelerate output growth, which will also help in boosting manufacturing output that would ultimately aid moderation in prices. It also requested Management to continue its use of administrative measures, including discretionary tools at its disposal through CRR to control money supply in the economy. In its final consideration, the Committee was clear that a loosening option was not desirable because it would trigger liquidity surfeit and fuel inflationary pressure as available funds may outstrip the economy absorptive capacity or domestic capacity utilization. It also feels loosening could trigger foreign exchange demand pressure, as the excess liquidity would be channeled to either frivolous importations or speculative holding of foreign exchange as alternative investment channels narrow; leading to foreign exchange depreciation and or inflation. The MPC also dropped a tightening option at this meeting in view of the fragile state of the current GDP growth rate and potential external and domestic 11 headwinds confronting the economy. The Committee opined that tightening could truncate the steady improvement in credit performance, including other financial soundness indicators, and reverse the declining trend in NPLs. Moreover tightening could counteract the CBN's credit expansion motive as a necessary condition for improved economic growth and employment generation. The MPC, therefore, concluded that a HOLD stance remains desirable at this time, as this would indicate a conservative but cautious and consistent policy choice given the prevailing economic conditions and outlook, thus strengthening policy credibility and focus. It also feels that a hold would signal MPCs realisation of the fragility of the growth recovery and its sensitivity to emerging global and domestic uncertainties. Hence the need to sustain the current policy trajectory. After a careful balancing of the benefits and downsides of each policy option, the MPC decided to hold all policy parameters constant; believing that a hold stance will enable the continued permeation of current policy measures in supporting the recorded growth recovery and further boost production and productivity, which would ultimately rein-in inflation in the short to medium term. The Committee thus decided by a unanimous vote to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 115 per cent. In summary, the MPC voted to retain: I The MPR at 115 per cent; II. The Asymmetric Corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; III. The CRR at 275 per cent; and IV. The Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele 12 Governor.

Chile,2022-01-26,"NoPtrae sdse R eplereasnes*a Wednesday, 26 January 2022. Monetary Policy Meeting  January 2022 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 150 basis points, to 5.5%. The decision was adopted by all the Board members present. The world economy has lost some dynamism, but the outlook for the year shows no major changes. Covid-19 infections have spread considerably in many countries and, although mobility has decreased, their effects on activity have been limited. In any case, the risks surrounding the Chinese economy are rising because of tightened constraints and their potential impact on the persistence of bottlenecks at the global level. Inflation has continued to rise in several economies, and central banks have intensified their move towards the withdrawal of monetary stimulus. Geopolitical risks have escalated, especially in Europe. In this context, the financial markets report a widespread rise in long-term interest rates, plus an appreciation of a significant number of currencies against the dollar, and stock market falls, especially in developed economies. Meanwhile, the oil price has risen significantly, to around US$85 per barrel (+19% since the last Meeting for the WTI-Brent average), while the copper price stands near US$4.5 per pound. The Chilean financial market's evolution has been marked by both external and internal factors —mostly the latter— possibly associated to a decline in internal uncertainty. Since the previous Meeting, the peso has appreciated close to 5%, stock prices have risen by around 5%, long-term interest rates —with ups and downs— have remained fairly constant, and the country risk (CDS) has dropped by nearly 10 basis points. Meanwhile, short-term interest rates have increased, in response to higher headline inflation and expectations of a higher monetary policy rate. In any case, uncertainty is still high by historical standards and long-term interest rates maintain a significant spread with respect to comparable economies. On aggregate, activity and demand indicators are consistent with the upper part of the estimated range for 2021 considered in the December Monetary Policy Report. In November, activity rose by 14.3% annually (0.3% monthly in the seasonally-adjusted series), where the contribution of services and, more moderately, of retail and wholesale trade, stood out. On the demand side, the sustained dynamism of imports of all kinds of goods is worth noting. Private expectations (EES) continue to foresee GDP growing at around 2% in 2022 and 2023. The labor market continues to recover steadily, with still contained household labor supply and high demand for labor by firms. Bank credit in general has maintained moderate dynamism, with demand-side factors dominating. Interest rates are on the rise for all types of credit, but more markedly for consumer loans. Annual CPI variation mounted to 7.2% in December, outpacing market expectations and the forecast in the last MP Report. Price hikes were generalized across all the items in the basket. Again, the increase in core inflation (i.e., the CPI minus volatile items) stood out at 5.2% annually, driven by the prices of goods —which were unexpectedly high—, and also services. Within the volatile component, most remarkable were the contribution of fuels and the evolution of some specific items. Private inflation expectations remain above 3% in the two-year horizon. The evolution of inflation continues to face significant risks and their possible materialization becomes especially relevant in a context where both the annual change in the CPI and its outlook Nota de prensa are already high. In particular, the recent evolution of activity and inflation is somewhat above the forecast in the December MP Report, and inflationary pressures from the international scenario have increased. The Board's decision is consistent with a monetary policy path that, in the short term would stand near the upper edge of the MPR corridor described in the last Report. The March Report will feature a new evaluation of the corridor. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be released at 8:30 hours of Thursday 10 February 2022. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will be held on 29 March 2022 and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours the same day. The Spanish original prevails.

United States,2022-01-26,"EST January 26, 2022 Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months but are being affected by the recent sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. Job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks to the economic outlook remain, including from new variants of the virus. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee decided to continue to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases, bringing them to an end in early March. Beginning in February, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $20 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $10 billion per month. The Federal Reserve's ongoing purchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. EST January 26, 2022In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C. Williams. Vice Chair; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Esther L George; Patrick Harker; Loretta J Mester; and Christopher J Waller. Patrick Harker voted as an alternate member at this meeting."
South Africa,2022-01-27,"PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 27 January 2022 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Over the past year, rising vaccination rates have sustained confidence and the global economic recovery, despite the rapid spread of the Omicron virus. Looking ahead to this year, global growth will be slower as the rebound from the pandemic fades. Growth in emerging market and developing economies will continue to lag that in advanced economies, due to a slower pace of vaccinations and other headwinds. South Africa's economy rebounded strongly from the pandemic in 2021, but going forward the growth rate will, like global growth, slow and remain subject to various risks. The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) forecast for global gross domestic product (GDP) is unchanged at 5.9% in 2021. Global growth is expected to slow to 4.4% in 2022 (down from 4.9%). The SARB's forecast for global growth in 2021 sits at 6.2% (down from 6.3%), and is unchanged for 2022 and 2023, at 4.4% and 3.3%. MPC Statement 27 January 2022 Page 1. The SARB's forecast for global growth in 2021 sits at 6.2% (down from 6.3%), and is unchanged for 2022 and 2023, at 4.4% and 3.3%. MPC Statement 27 January 2022 Page 1 respectively.1 GDP growth in our trading partners in 2024 is forecast to be 2.7%. Global economic conditions are less supportive of emerging and developing economies now than they were for most of this past year. Although policy settings in advanced economies remain accommodative, higher global inflation is likely to accelerate normalisation of interest rates and balance sheet reductions by major central banks. It is less certain how far the normalisation process will go and the exact timing, and this uncertainty continues to cause financial market turmoil and capital flow volatility. Risk aversion in financial markets has increased. Economies that failed to take advantage of better global conditions or to reduce large macroeconomic imbalances remain vulnerable. Last year saw the ongoing recovery of the South African economy from the pandemic, but also the damage caused by the July unrest, cyber attacks and strikes. Those factors led to a downward revision to the growth forecast for the year as a whole, from the 5.2% forecast in November to 4.8%.2 This year and next, economic growth will remain well above a low rate of potential growth.3 GDP is expected to grow by 1.7% in 2022. The deceleration in growth from 2021 to 2022 is primarily a result of the fading rebound from the pandemic, alongside a climbdown from high export prices. GDP growth is forecast to be 1.8% in 2023 and 2.0% in 2024.4 1 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. 2 In the third quarter of 2021, economic growth was -5.8%, compared to our previous estimate of -2.5%. For the fourth quarter, we expect a GDP outcome of 5.5%, compared to the previous 2.6%. On a not-annualised basis, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate for the third quarter was -1.5%, compared to our estimate of -0.6%. The fourth quarter is expected to be 1.4%, compared to 0.6%. 4 The growth forecast includes expected changes in the policy rate. MPC Statement 27 January 2022 Page 2. MPC Statement 27 January 2022 Page 2 With lower export prices the economy's future demand will depend more on investment and household spending. Sustained low borrowing costs and faster economic growth have strengthened private sector investment somewhat, despite ongoing constraints from loadshedding and policy uncertainty. Household spending remains supportive, as a result of good growth in disposable income, rising asset prices, and more credit demand. Overall, and after revisions, the risks to the medium-term domestic growth outlook are assessed to be balanced. With the downward revision to GDP growth for 2021, the output gap is more negative over the forecast period compared to the November meeting. However, as the economy is forecast to grow faster than potential, the output gap closes steadily through to 2024. While important commodity export prices such as for coal, iron ore, platinum, and rhodium generally decreased in the latter half of 2021, in recent weeks some prices and export values have been more buoyant. As a result, the current account surplus of the past year is expected to decline at a slower pace than at the time of the November meeting.5 The current account deficit in 2023 and 2024 is, at this stage, forecast to be smaller than previously expected. Although fiscal risk has eased, financing conditions remain volatile and the yield curve for rand-denominated bonds remains steep. Ten-year bond yields remain at about 9.4%. 5 The current account surplus is expected to decline in 2022 to about 0.4% of GDP (from 3.8% of GDP in 2021). The current account is expected to be in deficit of -0.2% in 2023 (from -1.8%) and -0.6% in 2024 (from -2.5%). MPC Statement 27 January 2022 Page 3. MPC Statement 27 January 2022 Page 3 For much of 2021, strong commodity export prices and generally favourable global financial and economic conditions strengthened the currency above its long-run equilibrium level. In recent months, global and domestic factors contributed to a weaker rand exchange rate and the rand now sits somewhat below its equilibrium level. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R15.60 to the US dollar, compared with R15.10 at the time of the previous meeting.6 Over the past year and into this year, global supply shortages and strong demand have caused a wide range of prices to accelerate, including raw materials, intermediate inputs and food.7 Some of these price increases have passed-through to consumer prices in major economies. Our estimate for inflation in the G3 was revised higher to 3.1% in 2021 and 2022 (up from 2.9% and 2.4%), and is revised slightly lower to 1.7% in 2023.8 For 2024. G3 inflation of 1.6% is forecast, unchanged from the previous meeting. Oil prices are revised up for this year, and fuel price inflation is higher at 13.7% (up from 4.6%).9 Local electricity price inflation for 2021 was 10.2%, while the forecast for 2022 is revised up to 14.5% (from 14.4%) and remains at 12.4% in 2023. For 2024, electricity price inflation of 10% is expected, unchanged from the previous meeting. 6 The rand has appreciated by about 1.5% to the US dollar since the November meeting. 7 World food prices continue to rise. The assumption used for the forecast for USD-denominated world food prices increased from 13.4% in September to 25.4% for November and to 28% for the January meeting. 8 The G3 comprises the United States, the Eurozone, and Japan. The latest CPI inflation in the respective components sits at 7%, 5% and 0.6%. 9 For 2023 and 2024, petrol price inflation is expected to be -0.1% and 1.7%, respectively. Our assumptions are now for oil prices to average $78 per barrel in 2022 and $72 per barrel in 2023. An average price of $70 per barrel is expected in 2024. MPC Statement 27 January 2022 Page 4. MPC Statement 27 January 2022 Page 4 Headline inflation in 2021 came out at 4.5%. The Bank's forecast of headline inflation for this year is revised higher to 4.9% (from 4.3%). Headline inflation is expected to be 4.5% in 2023 and in 2024. Core inflation was 3.1% in 2021, and is forecast to rise to 3.8% in 2022 (up from 3.7%). With the economy expanding faster than potential over the forecast period, core inflation is projected to rise to 4.5%, despite a still low rate of services price inflation and unit labour costs. Core inflation forecasts for 2023 and 2024 are unchanged at 4.4% and 4.5%. The risks to the inflation outlook are assessed to the upside. Global producer price and food price inflation continued to surprise higher in recent months and could do so again. Oil prices increased strongly through 2021 and are up sharply year to date. Current oil prices sit well above forecasted levels for this year. Electricity and other administered prices continue to present short- and medium-term risks. Given the moderate medium and long-term inflation projections set out above, higher domestic import tariffs, stronger services inflation, and higher wage demands present additional upside risks to the inflation forecast. A particular risk arises from the possibility of a faster normalisation of global policy rates than is currently built into the forecast, which assumes some rate hikes to begin around June of 2022. Added to this is the risk that quantitative tightening will occur more quickly than previously expected, leading to stronger capital flow reversals from riskier assets such as emerging market debt. MPC Statement 27 January 2022 Page 5. MPC Statement 27 January 2022 Page 5 Average surveyed expectations of future inflation have increased to 4.8% for 2022 (from 4.4%). Market-based surveyed expectations for inflation have also increased to 4.8%.10 In the near term, headline inflation has increased well above the mid-point of the inflation target band, and returns close to the mid-point in the fourth quarter of 2022. Some risks to the inflation outlook, like food and fuel, have been realised, and other risks, such as currency volatility and capital flow reversals, have become more pronounced. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 4% per year, with effect from the 28th of January 2022. Four members of the Committee preferred an increase and one member preferred an unchanged stance. The implied policy rate path of the Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) indicates gradual normalisation in the first quarter of 2022, and into 2023 and 2024, given the inflation forecast. As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting in response to new data and risks. Given the expected trajectory for headline inflation and upside risks, the Committee believes a gradual rise in the repo rate will be sufficient to keep inflation expectations well anchored and moderate the future path of interest rates. However, economic and financial conditions are expected to remain more volatile for the foreseeable future. In 10 The (Q4) Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey expectations rose above the target midpoint to 4.8% (4.4%) for 2022 and 4.7% (4.5%) for 2023. Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) in January expect inflation to be higher at 4.8% (4.5%) in 2022, 4.5% (4.3%) in 2023 and 4.4% in 2024. Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These now sit at 4.8% for the 5-year and 5.93% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year breakeven inflation sits at 6.4%. MPC Statement 27 January 2022 Page 6. MPC Statement 27 January 2022 Page 6 this uncertain environment, policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. The MPC will seek to look through temporary price shocks and focus on potential second round effects. Current repurchase rate levels reflect an accommodative policy stance through the forecast period, keeping financial conditions supportive of credit demand as the economy continues to recover.11 The Bank has ensured adequate liquidity in domestic markets and will continue to closely monitor funding markets for stress. In addition, regulatory relief provided to banks continues to support lending to households and firms. Better anchored expectations of future inflation should keep interest rates lower for longer, and can be realised by achieving a prudent public debt level, increasing the supply of energy, moderating administered price inflation and keeping wage growth in line with productivity gains. Such steps will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy. Lesetja Kganyago GOVERNOR The next statement of the MPC will be released on 24 March 2022. The real repurchase rate calculation here is based on the 1-quarter ahead inflation forecast. MPC Statement 27 January 2022 Page 7."
Colombia,2022-01-28,"The board voted 5-2 to raise the benchmark interest rate to 4.0%; two board members voted for a 75-basis point increase. The decision was based on the following considerations. Headline inflation continued on an upward trajectory, rising 0.73% in December and outpacing the technical staff's projection by 30-basis points. As a result, overall consumer inflation ended the year at 5.62%. Core inflation, measured excluding food and regulated items, closed the year at 2.49%, while the year-end average of core inflation indicators was 3.45%. Inflation results in 2021 led to a significant increase in inflation expectations from a variety of sources, among them inflation excluding food. The technical staff revised its headline and core inflation forecasts upward to 4.3% and 4.5% respectively in 2022, and to 3.4% and 3.6% in 2023. Data from the monthly economic tracking indicator (ISE) suggests that economic activity continued to expand in November. As a result, the technical staff was able to reaffirm its GDP growth forecast for 2021, at close to 10%. With this, annual GDP in 2021 would surpass 2019 levels, and remaining excess capacity in the economy would nearly be overcome. GDP growth in 2022 would be projected at around 4.3%. The current account balance of payments is expected to close 2021 with a deficit of around 5.7% of GDP. This would be expected to moderate in 2022 to 4.9%, as international financial conditions tighten due to the acceleration of monetary policy normalization in the United States and other advanced economies. With this decision, the BDBR has reiterated its commitment to the 3% annual inflation target. The increase in the benchmark interest rate takes into account the current dynamism of Colombia's economy, which has recovered quickly from the effects of the pandemic and no longer requires the same degree of monetary stimulus that has been administered over the course of the COVID-19 crisis.

Mongolia,2022-01-28,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Increasing the policy rate and the reserve requirement on domestic currency liabilities, modifying financing conditions of long-term repo No: 2022/01 Date: January 28, 2022 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia held an unscheduled meeting on January 28, 2022. Taking into consideration the current state of the economy and financial markets as well as outlook and risks to the domestic and foreign economic environment, the MPC decided to: 1. Increase the policy rate by 0.5 percentage point to 6.5 percent; 2. Raise the reserve requirement on liabilities in domestic currency by 2 percentage points to 8 percent; 3. Modify financing conditions of long-term repo issued to non-mining exports and manufacturing sectors. Outlook for global economic growth has been revised downwards mainly due to the intense spread of Omicron variant of COVID-19, while cost-push inflation has been surging in many countries owing to prevailing transportation & logistical restrictions and supply chain disruptions. Prices of imported goods have also risen in our country given the continued transportation restrictions in foreign trade. Escalation in prices of meat, vegetable, fuel and imported goods have caused price increases in other products and services higher than expectations. Annual headline inflation reached 13.4 percent nationwide and 14.8 percent in Ulaanbaatar city as of December 2021. Demand-driven inflation outlook remains as gradually increasing at a rate consistent with recovery in economic activities, while outlook for supply-driven inflation will be mainly dependent on the time frame to resolve border restrictions as well as transportation and logistical disruptions. The series of monetary and macro-prudential policy measures as well as financial regulatory instruments implemented with the purpose of alleviating negative economic impact stemming from the pandemic has been effective in supporting economic recovery and ensuring financial stability. Though indicators in mining and transportation sectors undermined expectations in the last 2 months of 2021, indices for manufacturing, trade and services' sectors exceeded expectations mostly owing to easing of business restrictions and expansion in domestic demand. Monetary policy stance is being tightened, taking into consideration risks of higher inflation expectations and intensifying second-round effects of inflation that could be caused by continued supply disruptions resulting from restrictions at the border. Moreover, outlook for higher base rate in foreign markets has facilitated an increase in domestic policy rate. The Bank of Mongolia will adjust its monetary policy stance in a timely manner in accordance with the developments of economic recovery and inflation outlook. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Brazil,2022-02-02,"In its 244th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate to 10.75% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's reference scenario:. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its reference scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, a possible reversion, even if partial, of the increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency would produce a lower-than-projected inflation in the reference scenario. On the other hand, fiscal policies that imply additional impulses to aggregate demand or deteriorate the future fiscal path may have a negative impact on prices of important financial assets as well as pressure the country's risk premium. In spite of the more favorable public accounts data, the Committee assesses that the uncertainties regarding the fiscal framework maintain elevated the risk of deanchoring inflation expectations and, therefore, the upward asymmetry in the balance of risks. This implies a higher probability of inflation paths above the one projected under the reference scenario. Taking into account the reference scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 1.50 p.p. to 10.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its reference scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2022 and, to a larger degree, 2023. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment. The Committee considers that, given the increase in its inflation projections and in the risk of a deanchoring of long-term expectations, it is appropriate to advance the process of monetary tightening significantly into the restrictive territory. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process and the expectation anchoring around its targets consolidate. For its next steps, the Committee foresees as adequate, at this moment, a reduction in the pace of adjustment of the interest rate. This indication reflects the stage of the tightening cycle as its cumulative effects will manifest themselves over the relevant horizon. The Copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic activity, on the balance of risks, and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fernanda Magalhaes Rumenos Guardado. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Georgia,2022-02-02,"02.02.2022 The National Bank of Georgia keeps its monetary policy rate unchanged at 10.5 percent On February 2, 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged. The monetary policy rate is 10.5 percent. The extraordinary situation caused by the pandemic has led to many uncertainties in the world economy, have emerged in stages and challenged policymakers. Particularly concerning among them is a high inflation environment, which is especially relevant for Georgia - in December, the annual inflation rate rose to 13.9 percent. The base effect of the 2020 subsidy on utility bills was the main driver for this increase since the month before. As mentioned in the previous press releases of the Committee, this effect will temporarily persist in January-February this year as well. Overall though, since the first half of 2021, high inflation has been driven by globally rising prices for food, oil and shipping. Consequently, high inflation is largely due to imported goods, that reflect increased US dollar prices in international markets. However. It should be noted, that the recent strengthening of the nominal effective GEL exchange rate has somewhat eased the pressure from international markets. In addition, both core and monthly inflation in recent months have shown early signs of stabilization. According to the current forecast, other things being equal, inflation will start to decline gradually from spring of this year and will approach the target by the end of the year. Tighter monetary policy, along with the fading out of one-off factors and fiscal consolidation, will contribute to this reduction in inflation. As for aggregate demand, according to the preliminary data, real GDP growth was 10.6 percent in 2021. The economic activity in 2021 is a result of pent-up demand since the period of pandemic-related restrictions, continued high credit activity and fiscal stimulus. According to the baseline scenario, economic growth is projected at 5 percent in 2022. Against the backdrop of rising risks of inflation expectations, the gradual increase in the monetary policy rate over the past year led to tight monetary policy stance. It is still important that, in the face of strong supply shocks, persistently high inflation does not raise long-term inflation expectations. At the same time, risks are apparent in terms of both geopolitical tensions as well as faster-than-expected tightening of global financial conditions. Taking into account these factors, the Committee maintained tight monetary policy. Monetary policy will keep a tightening bias until the risks of rising inflation expectations are sufficiently mitigated. In the wake of the global economic recovery, foreign demand continues to grow. According to the preliminary data, exports in December 2021 increased by about 29 percent annually, while the increase compared to the corresponding period of 2019 is 6 percent. Revenues from international travelers increased annually approximately 9-fold in December, although it is still well below 2019 December level (by 42 percent). Imports have also increased against the backdrop of higher domestic demand: in December 2021, year-on-year growth was 26 percent, while the increase compared to the corresponding period of 2019 is about 7 percent. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on March 30, 2022."
Czech Republic,2022-02-03,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank increased the two-week repo rate to 4.50%, i.e. by 0.75 percentage point. At the same time, it increased the discount rate by the same amount to 3.50% and the Lombard rate to 5.50%. Five members voted in favour of this decision and two members voted for leaving rates unchanged.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. Consistent with the forecast is a substantial rise in market interest rates at the start of this year. The Czech National Bank is thus continuing to respond to the combination of strong price pressures from the domestic and foreign economies, which are gradually passing through to domestic inflation. The interest rate increase will ensure that inflation returns close to the 2% the target at the monetary policy horizon and will help anchor inflation expectations. Continuing production and supply chain problems and another wave of the pandemic are slowing the recovery of the global economy, including the euro area. However, the economic growth outlook for this year and the next is little changed compared with the previous forecast. A gradual easing of international logistics problems remains the key assumption. These effects, coupled with a jump in energy prices, are simultaneously fostering sizeable price pressures. This is reflected in a marked upward revision of expected producer price inflation and, to a lesser extent, also consumer price inflation in the euro area, especially this year. The slightly higher 3M EURIBOR outlook for 2023 reflects a shift in financial market expectations towards higher future inflation in the euro area and the related reaction by the ECB. The Brent crude oil outlook has shifted slightly higher compared with the previous forecast, due to underproduction, more robust global demand and concerns about low global stocks and reserve capacity. However, the price of oil is expected to fall gradually from its current high levels this year and the next. The outlook for the euro-dollar exchange rate has moved towards a modestly stronger dollar but still assumes slight appreciation of the euro against the US currency. The Czech economy will continue to recover from the pandemic this year. Despite more high numbers of positive cases, the forecast does not expect the introduction of measures having a significant dampening effect on domestic economic activity. Economic growth will continue to be driven largely by household consumption, although the initially high year-on-year growth of the latter will be due to last year's low base. Households' consumption expenditure will be funded by solid growth in disposable income and spending of the forced savings accumulated during the shutdowns of the economy. However, growth in consumer demand will be dampened by strong inflation and increased interest rates. Higher corporate investment will be motivated by continued growth in external demand, a shortage of workers on the domestic labour market and increasing wage costs. Government investment will also record growth, supported by absorption of EU funds. The problems in global production and supply chains, which are being felt strongly in the highly industrial Czech economy, will persist this year, resulting in higher additions to inventories. However, their impact on GDP will be smaller than in autumn last year and will gradually disappear during the second half of the year. As international trade gets going again, export growth will recover gradually and net exports will start to contribute to growth again. The Czech economy will grow by roughly 3% overall this year, similarly to last year. Economic activity will thus reach the pre-pandemic level by the year-end. Next year, economic growth will accelerate slightly. Headline inflation will rise significantly further at the start of this year and exceed 9%, with all its components contributing to the increase. Core inflation will go up further. Traditional repricing in January, amid strong domestic demand, will reflect the sizeable previous growth in firms' personnel and material costs and the recent rise in energy prices on commodity exchanges. The contribution of the costs of owner-occupied housing to core inflation will also remain significant. Moreover, the pick-up in inflation will be due significantly to a jump in administered price inflation on the back of the surge in energy prices and the end of the temporary waiver of VAT on electricity and gas. Food price inflation will also stay high in the first half of this year. Inflation will peak in the first half of this year. It will then start to fall gradually as growth in import prices and firms' production costs slows, aided by an appreciating koruna, and as the stabilising effect of monetary policy manifests itself via domestic demand. Inflation will fall close to the Czech National Bank's 2% target over the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in the first half of 2023. Consistent with the winter forecast is a substantial rise in market interest rates, followed by a gradual decline from the second half of this year onwards. The rise in rates reflects a need to respond to the combination of exceptionally strong price pressures from the domestic and foreign economies. The monetary policy response to date will ensure that inflation falls towards the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon and will help anchor inflation expectations. The subsequent gradual decline in rates towards their long-run neutral level starting in the second half of this year reflects an expected decline in inflation pressures in the Czech economy in 2023 and once again firmly anchored inflation expectations. The exchange rate of the koruna will average CZK 24.50 to the euro in Q1. It will appreciate to CZK 24 to the euro in Q2, owing to a significantly positive interest rate differential vis-à-vis the euro area, and later stabilise just below this level. By comparison with the autumn forecast, the inflation outlook is considerably higher for this year and slightly higher for next year. Economic growth was faster last year than expected in the autumn. By contrast, the growth forecast for this year and the next has been revised downwards. The outlook for domestic interest rates is higher for 2022 and 2023. Expectations regarding the koruna exchange rate are essentially unchanged. The Bank Board assessed the uncertainties and risks of the new forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being significant and moderately inflationary overall. The possibility of weaker anchoring of inflation expectations to the CNB's 2% target is an inflationary risk. Slower appreciation of the koruna as a result of a sharp tightening of monetary policy abroad or an escalation of the situation in Ukraine is a risk towards a slower or later decline in domestic interest rates. Conversely, the possibility of more modest growth in household consumption in response to the jump in energy prices and, to some extent, also consolidation of Czech public finances are downside risks to inflation. The uncertainties include the extent of repricing of goods and services this January and the duration of the overloading of global production and supply chains."
Euroarea,2022-02-03,"Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. The euro area economy is continuing to recover and the labour market is improving further, helped by ample policy support. But growth is likely to remain subdued in the first quarter, as the current pandemic wave is still weighing on economic activity. Shortages of materials, equipment and labour continue to hold back output in some industries. High energy costs are hurting incomes and are likely to dampen spending. However, the economy is affected less and less by each wave of the pandemic and the factors restraining production and consumption should gradually ease, allowing the economy to pick up again strongly in the course of the year. Inflation has risen sharply in recent months and it has further surprised to the upside in January. This is primarily driven by higher energy costs that are pushing up prices across many sectors, as well as higher food prices. Inflation is likely to remain elevated for longer than previously expected, but to decline in the course of this year. The Governing Council therefore confirmed the decisions taken at its monetary policy meeting last December, as detailed in the press release published at 13:45 today. Accordingly, we will continue reducing the pace of our asset purchases step by step over the coming quarters, and will end net purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) at the end of March. In view of the current uncertainty, we need more than ever to maintain flexibility and optionality in the conduct of monetary policy. The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its two per cent target over the medium term. I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing, and will then talk about our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. Economic growth weakened to 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year. Nevertheless, output reached its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2021. Economic activity and demand will likely remain muted in the early part of this year for several reasons. First, containment measures are affecting consumer services, especially travel, tourism, hospitality and entertainment. Although infection rates are still very high, the impact of the pandemic on economic life is now proving less damaging. Second, high energy costs are reducing the purchasing power of households and the earnings of businesses, which constrains consumption and investment. And third, shortages of equipment, materials and labour in some sectors continue to hamper the production of manufactured goods, delay construction and hold back the recovery in parts of the services sector. There are signs that these bottlenecks may be starting to ease, but they will still persist for some time. Looking beyond the near term, growth should rebound strongly over the course of 2022, driven by robust domestic demand. As the labour market is improving further, with more people having jobs and fewer in job retention schemes, households should enjoy higher income and spend more. The global recovery and the ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support also contribute to this positive outlook. Targeted and productivity-enhancing fiscal measures and structural reforms, attuned to the conditions in different euro area countries, remain key to complement our monetary policy effectively. Inflation increased to 5.1 per cent in January, from 5.0 per cent in December 2021. Energy prices continue to be the main reason for the elevated rate of inflation. Their direct impact accounted for over half of headline inflation in January and energy costs are also pushing up prices across many sectors. Food prices have also increased, owing to seasonal factors, elevated transportation costs and the higher price of fertilisers. In addition, price rises have become more widespread, with the prices of a large number of goods and services having increased markedly. Most measures of underlying inflation have risen over recent months, although the role of temporary pandemic factors means that the persistence of these increases remains uncertain. Market-based indicators suggest a moderation in energy price dynamics in the course of 2022 and price pressures stemming from global supply bottlenecks should also subside. Labour market conditions are improving further, although wage growth remains muted overall. Over time, the return of the economy to full capacity should support faster growth in wages. Market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained broadly stable at rates just below two per cent since our last monetary policy meeting. The latest survey-based measures stand at around two per cent. These factors will also contribute further to underlying inflation and will help headline inflation to settle durably at our two per cent target. We continue to see the risks to the economic outlook as broadly balanced over the medium term. The economy could perform more strongly than expected if households become more confident and save less than expected. By contrast, although uncertainties related to the pandemic have abated somewhat, geopolitical tensions have increased. Furthermore, persistently high costs of energy could exert a stronger than expected drag on consumption and investment. The pace at which supply bottlenecks are resolved is a further risk to the outlook for growth and inflation. Compared with our expectations in December, risks to the inflation outlook are tilted to the upside, particularly in the near term. If price pressures feed through into higher than anticipated wage rises or the economy returns more quickly to full capacity, inflation could turn out to be higher. Market interest rates have increased since our December meeting. Bank lending rates for firms and households continue to stand at historically low levels and financing conditions for the economy remain favourable. Lending to firms has picked up, supported by both short and longer-term loans. Robust demand for mortgages is sustaining lending to households. Banks are now as profitable as they were before the pandemic and their balance sheets remain solid. According to our latest Bank Lending Survey, loan demand by firms increased strongly in the last quarter of 2021. This was driven by both higher working capital needs, stemming from supply bottlenecks, and increased financing of longer-term investment. In addition, banks continue to hold an overall benign view of credit risks, mainly because of their positive assessment of the economic outlook. Summing up, the euro area economy continues to recover, but growth is expected to remain subdued in the first quarter. While the outlook for inflation is uncertain, inflation is likely to remain elevated for longer than previously expected, but to decline in the course of this year. We will remain attentive to the incoming data and carefully assess the implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its two per cent target over the medium term."
Egypt,2022-02-03,"Press Release February 3rd, 2022 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 825 percent, 925 percent, and 875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 875 percen. Annual headline inflation increased to 59 percent in December 2021 from 56 percent in November 2021, resuming its upward trend since May 202. The upward trend was driven by unfavorable base effects resulting from the low inflation levels that were recorded in the second half of 2020, as well as higher international commodity prices and various fiscal consolidation measure. Furthermore annual inflation developments in December 2021 in specific were affected by the reversal of a short-lived tomato supply shock witnessed during December 202. In addition, annual core inflation increased for the fourth consecutive month in December 2021 to record 60 percent from 58 percent in November 2021, partly affected by unfavorable base effects which reflect the muted inflationary pressures during December 202. The increase was also driven by the higher annual contribution of services and retail item. Domestically economic activity extended its robust recovery in 2021 Q3, recording a preliminary figure of 98 percent, the highest real GDP growth rate since the beginning of the quarterly series in fiscal year 2001/0. Furthermore growth on an annual basis was amplified by the return of normalcy in economic activity compared to the corresponding period last year, which witnessed the gradual lifting of COVID-19 containment measure. Over the near-term, domestic economic activity is expected to be mainly driven by domestic demand, and in specific, gross domestic investment. Additionally leading indicators point towards a continued expansion across most economic sector. Regarding the labor market, the unemployment rate broadly stabilized in 2021 Q3, hovering around its pre-COVID 19 leve. The witnessed stability stemmed from the increase in employment, largely offsetting the increase in the labor forc. Global economic activity continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, but has shown some signs of slowdown due to global supply chain disruption. Additionally prospects of global economic recovery remain contingent on the efficacy of vaccines and the ability of countries to contain the spread of the virus, in light of the emergence of new variant. Global financial conditions remain broadly accommodative but are expected to tighten over the medium-term as monetary policy is expected to normalize sooner than was projecte. International prices for oil have continued to increase, recording the highest level since the outbreak of the pandemi. Concurrently international prices for select mineral commodities have begun to increas. Against this background, the MPC decided that keeping policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to achieve its price stability mandat. Monetary Policy Sector monetarypolicy@cbeorge."
Armenia,2022-02-08,"PRESS RELEASE 02.08.2022 Refinancing Rate Set at 9.5% At the August 2, 2022 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to raise the refinancing rate by 0.25 pp, setting it at 9.5%. In June 2022, the 12-month inflation continued to rise, amounting to 10.3%. The 12-month core inflation also increased, reaching 9.4%. Disruptions to global supply chains persisted during the second quarter. A slowdown in economic activity is observable in the main partner countries of Armenia. Certain easing of inflationary pressures is noticeable in the international commodity market, with prices however remaining at a historically high levels. Central banks of developed countries continue to tighten monetary conditions. This will contribute to the gradual containment of the global inflationary environment. Thus, the inflationary influence on the Armenian economy from the external sector will weaken to a certain extent, but it will still be persisting in the near future. Armenia's economy recorded higher than expected activity in the second quarter of 2022. It was particularly evident in the service sector. Positive developments were also recorded in the industry and exports. Demand factors dominate in the shaping of high economic growth. The latter continues to be largely determined by the significant inflow of international visitors and remittances from Russia. High demand leads to expanding of the headline inflation environment and maintaining of high inflation expectations. The appreciation of the Armenian dram partially offsets the increase in inflation. In the current situation, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia finds it appropriate to raise the policy rate. The CBA Board will be committed to take adequate measures to control inflation and neutralize any risk of deanchoring of inflation expectations. Under the presented monetary policy scenario, the 12-month inflation will gradually decrease and approach the 4% target in the medium-term horizon. The Board of the Central Bank estimates that the uncertainty over the macroeconomic outlook remains. At the same time, the risks of inflation deviating from the projection path are mostly balanced. In the case of risks emerging in any direction, the Board will adequately react and ensure the goal of price stability. Detailed information on the basis for determining the interest rate can be found in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by August 16, 2022."
Poland,2022-02-08,"Warsaw, 8 February 2022 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 8 February 2022 The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.50 percentage points, i.e. to 2.75%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: ▪ lombard rate at 3.25%; ▪ deposit rate at 2.25%; ▪ rediscount rate at 2.80%; ▪ discount rate at 2.85%. At the same time, the Council decided to increase the required reserve ratio from 2.0% to 3.5%. Incoming data indicate that after a strong growth in global economic activity in 2021 , in recent period economic conditions in some economies have deteriorated. Global economic activity is under a negative impact of supply-side constraints in some markets, high commodity prices and re-escalation of the pandemic. Latest forecasts indicate that global GDP growth in 2022 will be lower than in 2021, however, it will remain relatively robust, supported by an increase in consumption in many countries taking place amid good situation on the labour market and continued recovery in activity after the pandemic crisis. Further epidemic and geopolitical situation, as well as developments in economic policy in the biggest countries remain an uncertainty factor for further course of the global economic conditions. Energy commodity prices  in particular prices of natural gas, oil and coal  as well as prices of some agricultural commodities remain markedly higher than a year ago. At the same time, global supply chain disruptions continue and international shipping costs are still elevated. This contributes to a marked rise in inflation worldwide, which in many countries has reached highest levels in decades. At the same time inflation forecasts have been revised up and indicate that in many economies inflation in 2022 will remain higher than central banks' targets. Amidst a marked increase in inflation many central banks are withdrawing monetary accommodation. Central banks in the Central-Eastern Europe region have been increasing 1/3 interest rates. The ECB keeps negative interest rates, although it has been reducing the scale of asset purchases. The US Federal Reserve signals a termination of asset purchases in March and a start of interest rate increases. In Poland, economic activity continues to recover. According to Statistics Poland preliminary estimate. GDP growth in 2021 amounted to 5.7%, and in 2021 Q4 there was a significant acceleration in annual GDP growth. The situation in the labour market continues to improve, which is reflected in decreasing unemployment, rising employment and a marked increase in average wages. In the coming quarters economic situation is expected to remain favourable. However, there are uncertainty factors related to among others the impact of the pandemic on global and domestic economic conditions, as well as to the effects of supply-side constraints and high energy commodity prices on the economy. Inflation in Poland in December 2021 increased to 8.6% in annual terms, and in monthly terms it amounted to 0.9%. A significant contribution to an increase in inflation in 2021 was made by the rise in global prices of commodities  including energy and agricultural commodities  record high increase in prices of CO emission allowances, rising prices of 2 goods whose supply has been constrained by global pandemic disruptions as well as increases in electricity and natural gas prices introduced in 2021. Ongoing economic recovery, including an increase in demand driven by rising household income, has also added to an increase in inflation. These factors, together with a rise in regulated tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy will contribute to inflation remaining at an elevated level also in 2022. In turn, a reduction in some tax rates as part of the so-called Anti-inflationary Shield will have a curbing impact on inflation. In a longer perspective, inflation will decrease, which will be supported by expected fading of some global shocks currently boosting price growth, as well as by an increase in the NBP interest rates. At the same time, amidst further economic recovery and expected continuation of favourable labour market conditions, as well as probably more lasting impact of external shocks on price dynamics, there persists a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. In order to reduce this risk, i.e. striving to decrease inflation to the NBP target in the medium term, the Council decided to increase NBP interest rates again. The increase of the NBP interest rates will also curb inflation expectations. 2/3 Decisions of the Council in the coming months will continue to be aimed at reducing inflation to a level consistent with the NBP inflation target in the medium term, while taking into account economic conditions, so as to ensure medium-term price stability and at the same time support sustainable economic growth after the global pandemic shock. The Council's assessment regarding the total scale of monetary tightening necessary for achieving these goals will consider incoming information on perspectives for inflation and economic growth, including situation in the labour market. Zloty appreciation would be consistent with the direction of monetary policy conducted by the NBP. NBP may still intervene in the foreign exchange market and use other instruments envisaged in the Monetary Policy Guidelines. The timing and scale of the measures taken by NBP will depend on the market conditions."
Romania,2022-02-09,"The Board of the National Bank of Romania, having convened for the meeting of 9 February 2022, decided:. The annual inflation rate climbed to 8.19 percent in December 2021, from 7.80 percent in November, rising even higher above the upper bound of the variation band of the target, mainly as a result of further hikes in energy prices. In 2021 as a whole, the annual inflation rate thus added 6.13 percentage points (from 2.06 percent in December 2020). 80 percent of the advance came however from the increases in natural gas, electricity and fuel prices, while half of the contribution of only 15 percent made by core inflation was attributable to processed food, with the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate going up to 4.7 percent in December 2021, from 3.3 percent in December 2020. Consequently, the rise in the annual inflation rate was almost entirely driven by global supply-side shocks, triggering a steep upward movement of inflation worldwide in 2021, including in numerous European countries. On the domestic front, their effects were compounded by the liberalisation of the electricity market for household consumers. In 2021 Q4, the annual inflation rate saw a new pick-up (from 6.29 percent in September), more modest however than in the previous period, given the capping and compensation of energy prices for households starting with November. This time again, the rise was mainly caused by exogenous CPI components, particularly by the hikes in natural gas and electricity prices, as well as in fuel prices  primarily on account of the non-petrol-diesel subgroup , to which added more modest influences from VFE prices and administered prices. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate followed a slightly higher upward path in 2021 Q4, also compared with the forecasts, reaching 4.7 percent in December from 3.6 percent in September. This has further reflected the effects of the rise in agri-food commodity prices and energy and transport costs, as well as the influences of persistent bottlenecks in production and supply chains, compounded by increasingly higher short-term inflation expectations and the large share of imported goods in the CPI basket. Average annual CPI inflation rate and average annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP  inflation indicator for EU Member States) went up to 5.1 percent and 4.1 percent respectively in December 2021, from 3.6 percent and 2.9 percent respectively in September 2021. The new statistical data reconfirm the slowdown in economic growth in 2021 Q3 to 0.4 percent from 1.5 percent in Q2, contrary to expectations, which makes it likely for excess aggregate demand to have shrunk in this period to a much lower-than-forecasted value, also due to the notable downward revision of statistical data on economic growth in 2021 H1, which implies as well that in Q2 the pre-pandemic GDP level was surpassed by a relatively more modest margin. At the same time, the decline in annual GDP growth to 7.4 percent in Q3 from 13.9 percent in Q2 is reconfirmed, being markedly sharper than anticipated in November 2021. Annual GDP dynamics remained however high from a historical perspective, mainly on the back of private consumption, but also of the unusually large contribution made by the change in inventories, whereas gross fixed capital formation posted a small drop against the same year-earlier period, for the first time in the past 11 quarters. Moreover, net exports further made a negative contribution to annual GDP dynamics, yet this narrowed notably versus the previous quarter, even amid a somewhat faster decline in the annual change in exports of goods and services than that in imports thereof. However, trade deficit deepened in annual terms at a much stronger pace in Q3, given the relatively more unfavourable developments in the prices of imports. Recent developments and analyses point to a slowdown in economic growth in 2021 Q4 as well, also in the context of the fourth pandemic wave, the energy crisis and production and supply bottlenecks, entailing the fall in annual GDP dynamics to a significantly lower value than that anticipated in November 2021. The significant deceleration in the annual growth rate of retail trade October through November 2021 is relevant, only partly counterbalanced by the opposite evolution of market services to households and sales of motor vehicles. Moreover, the annual dynamics of industrial output visibly re-entered negative territory in this period, while the annual growth rate of new manufacturing orders halved against the Q3 average. However, the volume of construction works saw its annual contraction narrow, while the annual dynamics of exports of goods and services fell somewhat faster than those of imports, but solely as a result of more unfavourable developments in external prices. Against this background, the trade deficit further recorded a faster increase in annual terms, while the current account deficit stepped up its annual dynamics, also following the worsening of the secondary income balance. Thus, the current account deficit for January-November 2021 stood 57 percent higher than in the same year-earlier period. In 2021 Q4, labour market developments reflected the influences from the persistent bottlenecks in global production chains and higher energy and other commodity costs, as well as those from the fourth pandemic wave, which worsened the public health crisis domestically, calling also for the reimposition of certain mobility restrictions. Nevertheless, incoming data and survey results indicate a more obvious increase in labour shortage in January 2022  up to a level that is, however, well below the peak seen in 2019 , as well as more solid employment intentions over the near-term horizon as compared to 2021 Q4, with possible implications for wage renegotiations, especially in some sectors, also amid the fast rise in inflation rate. Looking at the financial market, the main interbank money market rates remained relatively steady following the key rate hike in January, at levels close to two-year highs. At the same time, yields on government securities almost stopped their overall upward movement in the first month of the year, yet they remained significantly above those in the region, particularly on longer maturities. The EUR/RON exchange rate posted a slight downward adjustment in January, albeit far more modest than those observed in the region, mainly on the back of a temporary improvement in the international financial market sentiment. Financial conditions tended, however, to tighten on the external front, amid the decisions and signals on the swifter normalisation of the monetary policy conduct by major central banks. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector climbed further in December 2021, albeit visibly more slowly, reaching 14.8 percent from 14.6 percent in November, solely due to the component in local currency. Leu-denominated loans saw their annual dynamics accelerate further, to 19.6 percent in December from 19.0 percent in November, also backed by government programmes, with their share in total thus widening to 72.4 percent. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the February 2022 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The current scenario, which is based on the available data and the regulations in force, shows a considerable worsening of the short-term outlook for inflation, under the strong impact of supply-side shocks, mainly of energy prices, as the forecasted path of the annual CPI rate has been again revised markedly upwards over the short-term horizon. Specifically, the annual inflation rate is expected to significantly accelerate its growth in 2022 Q2 and thus rise to a double-digit value, mainly as a result of far higher increases in natural gas and electricity prices, which will be strongly manifest after the withdrawal in April of compensation schemes for household consumers. Moreover, thereafter, the annual inflation rate will decrease probably only gradually, on a much higher-than-previously-forecasted path, but will witness a relatively steep downward adjustment in the first part of next year and return inside the variation band of the target in 2023 Q4, due to sizeable base effects, as well as to far lower values of the aggregate demand surplus foreseen over the forecast horizon and progressively declining as of mid-2022. Under the circumstances, the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate will probably continue to increase slightly for a few months, but will subsequently enter a somewhat more pronounced downward path than previously anticipated, before declining below the prior forecast at the end of the projection horizon. The compensation schemes for electricity and natural gas prices for households, presumed to be applied until March 2022, will entail an uneven path of the annual inflation rate over the short-time horizon. Thus, it is anticipated to decline very mildly January through March, before witnessing a significant leap in April, once prices return to contractual levels. The features of the support schemes are however uncertain, with a possible change in their duration and/or content being likely to affect markedly both the level and the future path of the annual inflation rate, especially in the short term. Moreover, significant uncertainties are still associated with how the impact of these schemes is assessed and included in the CPI calculation, and notable risks continue to come from developments in commodity prices, particularly of energy and agri-food, also amid the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical situation, as well as from persistent bottlenecks in production and supply chains. Uncertainties continue to stem from the evolution of the pandemic as well, given the still-ascending phase of the current wave, triggered by the more contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus, yet less virulent, implying a lower and abating severity of related restrictions, including in many European countries. Furthermore, a major source of uncertainties and risks remains the absorption of EU funds  especially those under the Next Generation EU programme  that is conditional on fulfilling strict milestones and targets for implementing the approved projects. At the same time, uncertainties and risks are also associated with the fiscal policy stance, given the coordinates of this year's budget programme, aiming at the progress in fiscal consolidation in line with commitments under the excessive deficit procedure, yet in a challenging economic and social environment domestically and globally. In the meeting held today, 9 February 2022, based on the currently available data and assessments, as well as in light of the elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 2.50 percent per annum from 2.00 percent per annum as of 10 February 2022. Moreover, it decided to raise the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 3.50 percent per annum from 3.00 percent per annum and the deposit facility rate to 1.50 percent per annum from 1.00 percent per annum, as well as to maintain firm control over money market liquidity. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to keep the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to anchor inflation expectations over the medium term, as well as to foster saving through higher bank rates, so as to bring back the annual inflation rate in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat target on a lasting basis, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth in the context of the fiscal consolidation process. The NBR closely monitors developments in the domestic and international environment and stands ready to use the tools at its disposal to achieve the fundamental objective of price stability in the medium term. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be published on 11 February 2022 at 10:00 a.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 21 February 2022 at 3:00 p.m. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board will be held on 5 April 2022."
Thailand,2022-02-09,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 1/2022 Mr. Piti Disyatat. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 9 February 2022 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent. The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would continue to recover, as the Omicron variant would exert limited pressure on the public health system. Downside risk to growth improved. However there remained a need to closely monitor developments of the pandemic going forward. Upside inflationary risks increased, and headline inflation would accelerate in early 2022 owing to the rises in energy and raw food prices. While demand-side inflationary pressures remained subdued in line with the gradual recovery of household income, there remained a need to monitor global energy prices and broad-based cost pass-through to goods and services. The Committee viewed that the continued accommodative monetary policy would help support economic growth, and thus voted to maintain the policy rate. In addition, the ongoing financial and fiscal measures, with the focus on rebuilding and enhancing potential growth, would play an important part in bolstering the robust recovery of the labor market as well as the income of businesses and households. The Committee assessed that the Thai economy in 2021 would expand faster than previously projected, and the recovery would continue into 2022 driven by higher merchandise exports, as well as a higher number of foreign tourist arrivals due to faster-than-expected relaxation of travel restrictions. However the recovery would remain fragile and uneven across sectors, especially in tourism which was below pre-pandemic levels. The Committee would monitor developments of the labor market as well as the impact of higher living costs given that income had not fully recovered. Headline inflation in 2022 would be higher than previously assessed and could exceed the target range in the early part of the year. This would be owing to price increases in certain sectors, especially energy and raw food products. Meanwhile upside risks to inflation increased. In particular, cost pass-through from producers to consumer prices could increase if energy and raw food prices remain elevated for longer than expected, or if the supply constraint problems broaden into other goods. Nevertheless the average inflation rate for the full year 2022 and medium-term inflation expectations would remain within the target range. Furthermore there had not been an indication of broad-based increases in the prices of goods and services, while 2 demand-side inflationary pressures remained subdued. In the period ahead, there remained a need to closely monitor developments of global energy prices and domestic goods and services prices, as well as the possibility of growing wage pressures. Overall liquidity remained ample, but liquidity distribution still varied across economic sectors. Long-term Thai government bond yields rose primarily in tandem with US Treasury yields. On exchange rates, the baht relative to the US dollar still exhibited volatile movements due to faster monetary policy normalization in advanced economies and the easing of domestic outbreak containment measures. The Committee would closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets, and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem, particularly through supporting SMEs in hedging against risks from exchange rate volatility. The Committee viewed that the government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery. Public health measures should strike a balance between containing the outbreak and supporting the recovery of economic activities. Fiscal measures should support the economic recovery in a targeted manner, with a focus on generating income and expediting measures to rebuild and enhance potential growth. Monetary policy should contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions overall. Financial and credit measures helped distribute liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner and reduce debt burden. These measures included the special loan facility, asset warehousing scheme, and other measures by specialized financial institutions (SFIs). In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt consolidation and debt restructuring in a sustainable manner through the scheme launched on September 3, 2021 to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers' long-term debt serviceability. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery. The Committee would closely monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook, namely, developments of the COVID-19 outbreak, global energy prices, higher cost pass-through, as well as the adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures. The Committee would stand ready to use appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary."
Mexico,2022-02-10,"World economic activity continued recovering during the fourth quarter of 2021, although at a slower rate and heterogeneously across countries due to the evolution of the pandemic and the actions implemented by their health, monetary and fiscal authorities. World inflation continued increasing due to pressures originated by bottlenecks in production, the reallocation of spending towards merchandise, the high levels of food and energy prices, and the recovery of certain services. This generated expectations of a faster withdrawal of monetary stimulus worldwide. Financial conditions tightened, with an increase in interest rates and a slightly stronger US dollar. In its latest monetary policy decision, the Federal Reserve announced that it will continue reducing the pace of its net asset purchases and that it will soon raise the target range for the federal funds rate. Simultaneously, many emerging market economies continued increasing their reference rates. Among key global risks are those associated with the pandemic, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, and adjustments in monetary and financial conditions. In domestic financial markets, the peso appreciated, while interest rates rose, especially short-term ones. Preliminary information shows that economic activity contracted slightly during the fourth quarter of 2021. Ample slack conditions prevailed, with significant differences across sectors. Inflationary pressures have been greater and have lasted longer than anticipated. In January, annual headline and core inflation were 7.07% and 6.21%, respectively. Their expectations for 2022 and 2023 increased again, while medium-term expectations decreased slightly and those for longer terms have remained stable at levels above the target. Forecasts for headline and core inflation were revised upwards, especially for 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 (see table). Their annual variations are expected to converge to the 3% target by the end of the forecast horizon. These projections are subject to risks. On the upside: external inflationary pressures; cost-related pressures; persistence of core inflation at high levels; exchange rate depreciation; and increases in both agricultural and livestock product and energy prices. On the downside: a greater-than-expected effect from the negative output gap; social distancing measures; and exchange rate appreciation. The balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon remains biased to the upside. The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the risk of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and price formation becoming contaminated, as well as the additional challenges posed by the ongoing tightening of global monetary and financial conditions. Based on these considerations, on this occasion, the Board decided to increase the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 6%. With this 1 action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon. For the next monetary policy decisions, the Board will monitor thoroughly inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations. The latter, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times with both an orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates and an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets. Voting in favor of the decision were Victoria Rodríguez. Galia Borja. Irene Espinosa, and Jonathan Heath. Voting in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.75% was Gerardo Esquivel. 2/ Forecast starting December 2021.

Peru,2022-02-10,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT FEBRUARY 2022 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 3.50% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 50 bps to 3.50 percent, thus continuing to normalize its monetary policy stance. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation was 5.68 percent in January, temporarily above the target range due mainly to a surge in international food and fuel prices, as well as exchange rate depreciation. Year-on-year core inflation was 3.08 percent in January, above the upper limit of the target range. Inflation is expected to return to the target range in the fourth quarter of the year, as transitory pressures (exchange rate and international fuel and grain prices) recede, with economic activity below potential. However, the increase in international energy and food prices has been more persistent than expected. One-year-ahead expected inflation for 2022 increased from 3.68 percent to 3.73 percent, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most indicators of expectations for economic activity remained in pessimistic territory in January. Global economic activity is improving, although at a slower pace due to the impact of COVID-19, persistent bottlenecks in the global supply of goods and services, and uncertainty in the pace of reversal of monetary stimulus in advanced economies. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation expectations and economic activity, with an aim to consider, if necessary, changes in the monetary stance so that inflation returns to the target range over the forecast horizon. In a context of uncertainty, financial volatility persists, with BCRP policies aiming at mitigating it. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 2.25 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 4.00 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on March 10, 2022."
Russia,2022-02-11,"On 11 February 2022, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to increase the key rate by 100 b.p. to 9.50% per annum. Inflation is developing appreciably above the Bank of Russia's October forecast. Expanding demand continues to exceed the capacity to build up output. Given the limited nature of available labour resources, the rapid recovery of economic activity exacerbates inflationary pressure. The situation in the global commodity markets remains proinflationary. Inflation expectations do not decline so far, hitting multi-year highs. In this environment, the balance of risks has tilted even more towards proinflationary ones. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy stance is aimed to return inflation to 4%. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate increase at its upcoming meetings. Key rate decisions will be made taking into account actual and expected inflation movements relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Based on the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reduce to 5.0-6.0% in 2022 to return to the target in the middle of 2023. Further on, annual inflation will stay close to 4%. Inflation movements. Inflation is developing appreciably above the Bank of Russia's October forecast. In January, monthly seasonally adjusted pace of growth in consumer prices picked up again after dropping in December, though staying below the peak values of the 2021 autumn. Annual inflation in January climbed to 8.7% (vs 8.4% in December 2021). It is estimated at 8.8% as of 4 February. Based on Bank of Russia estimates, indicators characterizing the most sustainable price movements substantially overshoot 4% (annualised). This reflects the fact that steady growth in domestic demand exceeds production expansion capacity in a wide range of sectors. In this context, businesses find it easier to pass higher costs, including on the back of rising global prices, on to consumers. Moreover, further expansion in industrial output is limited by growing labour shortages. Price growth inertia is intensified by high and unanchored inflation expectations of households and businesses. In January, households' inflation expectations slightly abated, though remaining close to six-year highs. Recent data indicate that business price expectations are growing, reaching new multi-year highs. Analyst expectations for 2022 have increased, but are anchored near 4% for the medium term. The dominating influence of inflationary factors has led to a more substantial and prolonged upward deviation of inflation from the target. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reduce to 5.0-6.0% in 2022 to return to the target in the middle of 2023. Further on, annual inflation will stay close to 4%. According to Bank of Russia estimates, monetary conditions have changed from accommodative to neutral ones. At present, growing actual inflation and high inflation expectations are constraining their transition to tight territory. Since the previous meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors, yields of short-term OFZs rose, mostly reflecting the market's expectations for the key rate path. Yields on medium- and long-term OFZs have also increased mainly due to elevated geopolitical tensions. Credit and deposit rates continue to grow. At the same time, rising nominal interest rates has not yet ensured a sufficient increase in the propensity to save and more balanced lending dynamics. The inflow of funds to fixed-term ruble deposits is moderate. At the same time, both retail and corporate lending markets maintain high activity. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy stance will accelerate the formation of tight monetary policy stance needed to return inflation to the target and limit the influence of the currently high inflation on long-term interest rates. This will solidify a trend towards the growing appeal of household deposits, protect the purchasing power of savings and ensure balanced growth of lending and the economy in general. Economic activity. According to Bank of Russia estimates, in 2021 Q4, the Russian economy noticeably deviated upwards from the balanced growth path. Rapid growth in lending, rising real wages and households' moderate propensity to save, driven by high inflation expectations, support expansion in consumer activity, especially in non-food markets. Growing domestic and external demand and high corporate profits shore up investment activity. Supply-side constraints in the Russian economy are associated not only with temporary problems such as interruptions in production and supply chains, but also with more sustainable factors. This primarily concerns the labour market. Demand for labour force continues to grow in many industries. At the same time, labour shortages are emerging in many sectors, despite the inflow of foreign labour. Unemployment is at its record lows, whereas the number of openings was the highest on record. The state of the labour market suggests that a further increase in steady growth rates of the Russian economy will be conditional primarily on the growth paces of labour productivity. In accordance with the updated baseline forecast. GDP is projected to grow 2.0-3.0% in 2022. As forecast by the Bank of Russia, the annual growth rate of the Russian economy will equal 1.5-2.5% in 2023 and 2.0-3.0% in 2024. This implies that the Russian economy will return to its balanced growth path by the end of 2023 and will develop in line with its potential further on. Inflation risks. The balance of risks has further shifted towards proinflationary risks. The effect of proinflationary factors may be intensified by elevated inflation expectations and corresponding secondary effects. Inflation slowdown may be hampered by slower than expected in the baseline scenario normalisation of production and logistics chains, labour shortages, as well as structural changes in the labour market caused by the pandemic. More massive staff shortages may cause labour productivity growth to lag behind wage growth. Due to the active growth of demand in the global economy, proinflationary risks associated with price trends in global commodity markets increased. This primarily concerns energy commodities and food markets. Short-term proinflationary risks associated with volatility in global financial markets caused by, among other factors, various geopolitical events, intensified, which may affect exchange rate and inflation expectations. Given further intensification of inflationary pressure in the world economy, the central banks of advanced economies are forced to implement a faster normalisation of monetary policy. This may become an additional source of higher volatility in global financial markets, especially in emerging markets. Disinflationary risks for the baseline scenario remain moderate, being largely linked to the pace and extent at which supply is adjusting to growing demand. A faster — relative to the baseline scenario — normalisation of production and logistics chains in the Russian and global economies may become another source of downward pressure on prices. The opening of borders as restrictive measures are lifted may restore the consumption of foreign services. Medium-term inflation is largely impacted by fiscal policy. In its baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia proceeds from the fiscal policy normalisation path stipulated by the Guidelines for Fiscal. Tax and Customs and Tariff Policy, which assumes a return to fiscal rule parameters in 2022. In its forecast, the Bank of Russia also factors in decisions made by the Government of the Russian Federation to invest the liquid part of the National Wealth Fund. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate increase at its upcoming meetings. Key rate decisions will be made taking into account actual and expected inflation movements relative to the target, economic developments over the forecast horizon as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting of 11 February 2022 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 18 March 2022. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. Statement by Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina in follow-up to Board of Directors meeting on 11 February 2022.

Philippines,2022-02-16,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility at 2.0 percent. The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were likewise kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. The latest baseline forecasts for 2022 and 2023 show that inflation could average within the 2-4 percent target range. However, the inflation projections have slightly increased from the previous monetary policy meeting, reflecting the impact of higher domestic food inflation and global oil prices. Inflation expectations have likewise risen marginally but continue to be anchored within the target band. The risks to the inflation outlook continue to lean slightly towards the upside for 2022 but remain broadly balanced for 2023. Upside risks are linked mainly to the continued shortage in domestic pork and fish supply and the possible impact of higher oil prices on transport fares. The implementation of non-monetary measures to ensure adequate supply of key food commodities must be sustained in order to mitigate supply-side pressures on inflation. At the same time, increased volatility in international oil prices warrants close monitoring and appropriate interventions when necessary in order to arrest potential second-round effects. Meanwhile, downside risks still emanate from the lingering threat of COVID-19 infections owing to possible case resurgence from new variants, as delays in the easing of containment protocols could temper domestic growth prospects. The Monetary Board also observed that the domestic economic recovery has continued to gain traction on the back of the Government's ongoing vaccination program and the easing of mobility restrictions. However, elevated global commodity prices, heightened geopolitical tensions, and the uneven pace of vaccinations across countries could dampen the outlook for global economic recovery. On balance, the Monetary Board deems it prudent to maintain the BSP's accommodative policy stance given a manageable inflation environment and emerging uncertainty surrounding domestic and global growth prospects. Looking ahead, given the stronger signs of recovery in output growth and labor market conditions and improvements in domestic financial markets, the BSP will continue to carefully develop its plans for the eventual normalization of its extraordinary liquidity measures when conditions warrant, in keeping with our price and financial stability mandates."
Turkiye,2022-02-17,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 14 percent. The variants and increasing geopolitical risks keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive and increases the uncertainty. Recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors, particulary in energy, and high transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand. Accordingly, while monetary policy communication of central banks in advanced economies varies with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they still continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs. Level of capacity utilization and other leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of robust external demand. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, current account balance is expected to post a surplus in 2022. Strengthening of the improving trend in current account balance is important for price stability. The Committee assesses that extending long-term Turkish lira investment credit will play a significant role in achieving this target. Increase in inflation in the recent period has been driven by pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, supply side factors such as the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices, supply constraints, and demand developments. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively pursued for sustainable price and financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the base effect. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. While cumulative impact of the recent policy decisions is being monitored, to create a foundation for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework is being conducted with the aim of encouraging permanent liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2022-02-21,"The ongoing economic activity in Israel continues at a high level alongside the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk of further morbidity cycles remains, and is leading to continued uncertainty regarding the expected intensity of economic activity. Inflation in Israel is around the upper bound of the target range, and was 3.1 percent in the past 12 months. Inflation expectations for the coming year from most sources increased, but are within the target range, as are expectations for the medium and long terms. Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel has weakened by 3.3 percent against the US dollar, by 3.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and by 3.5 percent against the euro. According to National Accounts data. GDP grew by 8.1 percent in 2021, beyond the forecast growth, and per capita GDP grew by 6.3 percent. For the first time since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, the GDP level crossed the precrisis trendline. The upward trend in home prices accelerated in recent months, with prices rising by 11.3 percent in the past 12 months, a significantly higher pace than in previous years. The Omicron variant's impact on the global economy has been relatively moderate, and the recovery trend in economic activity continues. The interruptions in the global production chains continue, although with slightly less intensity. The inflation indices in many countries are significantly higher than the central bank targets. Monetary tightening around the world therefore continues. TheIsraeli economy recorded high growth alongside the COVID-19 virus, and various indicators point to continued strong activity. TheCommittee's assessment therefore is that in the coming months, conditions will allow for the start of a gradual processof raising the interest rate in line with the path of inflation and the pace of growth and employment, in order to continue supporting the achievement of the monetary policy goals and to ensure the continued proper functioning of the financial markets. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, click here. The ongoing economic activity in Israel continues at a high level alongside the COVID-19 pandemic and the cyclical nature of the waves of morbidity. This has been possible, in part, thanks to the adaptation of most industries to functioning alongside the pandemic. The fifth wave is in a clear decline in Israel. However, the risks of further morbidity cycles and the parallel development of new strains of the virus in the future remain, and are leading to continued uncertainty regarding the expected intensity of economic activity in the short and medium term. Since the previous interest rate decision, the CPI increased by 0.3 percent in December and by 0.2 percent in January. Inflation in Israel is around the upper bound of the target range, and was 3.1 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 1). Net of energy and fruits and vegetables, inflation is 2.7 percent, and net the effects of taxation and regulation, it is 2.4 percent (Figure 2). The annual pace of inflation in both the nontradable and the tradable components increased in recent months (Figure 3). Inflation expectations for the coming year from most sources increased, but are within the target range (Figure 4). The professional forecasters project that inflation will remain around the upper bound of the target range in the coming months, and is then expected to decline toward the midpoint of the range. In February, the government announced a number of measures to deal with the cost of living, and according to an analysis by the Bank of Israel Research Department, they are expected to directly contribute to a decline of about 0.2 percentage points in inflation. Expectations for the second year derived from the capital market increased during the reviewed period to above the target range, but expectations from the third year onward are within the target range. Expectations for the longer terms declined compared to those published with the previous decision, and are around the midpoint of the target range (Figure 5). The Monetary Committee continues to closely monitor these developments, and maintains its assessment that there is no concern of an inflationary outbreak. Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel has weakened by 3.3 percent against the US dollar, by 3.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and by 3.5 percent against the euro (Figure 6). Despite the high morbidity level and the increased number of people in isolation, economic activity continues apace in most fields. According to the first estimate of National Accounts data for the fourth quarter. GDP in 2021 grewby 8.1 percent: exceeding the forecast growth: and per capita GDP grew by 6.3 percent. In the fourth quarter. GDP jumped by 16.6 percent (seasonally adjusted in annual terms; Figure 13). For the first time since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, the GDP level crossed the precrisis trendline (Figure 15). Strong fourth-quarter growth was registered in all areas of GDP. In parallel, the Central Bureau of Statistics revised 2021 third-quarter growth upward from 2.7 percent to 6.7 percent. The aggregate balance of the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey for January remains in positive territory despite the declines in recent months (Figure 16). Total credit card purchases in January and February remained similar to the previous two months, and despite the increase in morbidity rates, there was no significant decline in overall consumption (Figure 17). At the beginning of the Omicron wave, there were some declines in purchases in industries that were hard bit by the crisis, but it is clear that the trend of recovery in those industries is continuing. In view of the continuing global supply chain difficulties, the intensity of the equipment and raw materials constraint reported by companies remained high. Goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds) remain higher than before the crisis, and services exports remain very high (Figure 18). Goods imports are also high in all components (Figure 19). Labor market data for January indicate stability in the general employment level, and are not far from the precrisis levels. Even at the peak of the Omicron wave, the employment indices remained stable in the second half of January. However, there was a decline in actual labor inputs due to the high number of employees in isolation. The average number of employees who were absent from their workplace for an entire week in January was about 70,000 higher than the December average. The broad unemployment rate declined to 5.6 percent in January (Figure 20). The adjusted employment rate remained virtually unchanged, at 60.2 percent, reflecting a gap of about 65,000 employees (0.9 percentage points) from the average employment rate in 2019 (Figure 21). The number of job vacancies remained high in January (Figure 22). Despite the fact that the general employment environment is close to its precrisis state, there has been a change in the industry mix of employment relative to the situation in 2019. In recent months, most business sector industries have remained in states of underemployment, while employment in the healthcare, information, and communications industries has expanded beyond the employment trends that were expected prior to the crisis (Figure 23). The average wage in the economy increased in line with the precrisis trends, as did the average wage after neutralizing the effect of the employee composition that was typical of the COVID-19 period. However, there is some acceleration in the pace of increase in wages in the construction and information and communications industries. The upward trend in home prices accelerated in recent months, with prices rising by 11.3 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 9), a significantly higher pace than in previous years. Investors increased the pace of their purchases in October and November, prior to the increase in the purchase tax, and decreased their purchases thereafter (Figure 11). The volumeof new mortgages taken out in January declined relative to data from the end of 2021, but remained high by historical comparison (Figure 10). Alongside this, the annual increase in rents remained relatively moderate. There were declines in equity prices on the domestic capital market, similar to the global trend, alongside a more moderate increase in government bond yields. Corporate bond spreads also increased, but remained at low levels. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, financing constraints among businesses of various sizes remained similar to precrisis levels. However, in December-January, in view of the spread of the Omicron morbidity wave, there was some increase reported in financing constraints among small businesses (Figure 12). Many countries are easing the restrictions they have imposed, and some are even removing them almost completely. The International Monetary Fund revised its global growth forecast downward, and expects growth of 4.4 percent in 2022 (Figure 27). The global purchasing managers index declined in view of the outbreak of the Omicron variant, but remains at a level indicating economic expansion (Figure 29). The volume of world trade increased slightly, and is at a very high level (Figure 28). Equity indices in the advanced economies recorded price declines with high volatility. There was an increase in government bond yields in view of the increase in expectations of monetary tightening. Oil and other commodity prices increased in view of the tension in eastern Europe. The global inflation environment continues to increase. The inflation indices in most countries are higher than the central bank targets, and in some of them, core inflation is also above the target. In the US. GDP grew by a rate higher than expected in the fourth quarter, and the labor market remains tight. The Federal Reserve left the federal funds rate unchanged, but continued to cut the amounts to be purchased in its government bond and mortgage-backed securities purchasing program, so that the programs are expected to draw to a close in March. The Fed also announced its intention to reduce its balance sheet and to begin a process of raising the interest rate in view of the further increase in the inflation rate (in CPI terms) to an annual rate of 7.5 percent. In Europe, the increase in annual inflation continued, to 5.1 percent. The European Central Bank left its interest rate unchanged, but there are increasing assessments in the eurozone that the ECB will begin raising its interest rate later in the year. Inflationin the UK continued to increase, reaching 5.5 percent. The Bank of England again increased its interest rate to 0.5 percent. In a numberof other countries where inflation is above the central bank target, there were also increases in the interest rates (Figure 33). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on March 7, 2022. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. April 11, 2022, followed by a press briefing with the Governor."
South Korea,2022-02-24,"The bank of korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. Currently available information suggests that the global economy has continued to recover despite the spread of coronavirus variants, as economic activity has not contracted significantly, supported by accelerated vaccinations. Volatility in global financial markets has increased, affected by concerns over the pace of the US Federal Reserve's policy rate hikes as well as the Ukraine crisis. Government bond yields in major countries have risen sharply and stock prices have fallen considerably. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by COVID-19 developments, global inflation movements, monetary policy changes in major countries and geopolitical risks. The Korean economy has continued to recover despite the resurgence of COVID-19. Although the improvement in private consumption has moderated owing to the tightening of domestic COVID-19 restrictions, exports have sustained their buoyancy thanks to robust global demand. Facilities investment has somewhat slowed due to global supply constraints. Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with a sustained trend of increase in the number of persons employed. Going forward, the economy is likely to sustain its sound growth, as the recovery of private consumption is forecast to gradually pick up again while exports are expected to continue their solid trend of increase. GDP growth this year is projected to be around 3%, not deviating greatly from the November forecast. Consumer price inflation has remained high in the mid- to upper-3% range due to the ongoing sharp rise in the prices of petroleum products, as well as the accelerating increase in the prices of personal services and industrial products. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has risen to the mid-2% level. The inflation expectations of the general public have run at the mid- to upper-2% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will run substantially above 3% for a considerable time, exceeding the path projected in November, and run at the lower-3% level for the year overall. Core inflation is forecast to rise to the mid-2% level this year. In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates have risen significantly and stock prices have fallen considerably while the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has increased slightly, mainly driven by global financial market movements. The amount of increase in household loans has lessened, and the increase in housing prices has moderated in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board will appropriately adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation as the Korean economy is expected to continue its sound growth and inflation to run above the target level for a considerable time, despite underlying uncertainties over the virus. In this process the Board will judge when to further adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to COVID-19, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, the effects of the Base Rate raises, monetary policy changes in major countries, and the trends of growth and inflation."
Kazakhstan,2022-02-24,"Press Release 4 The base rate raised to 13.5% February 24, 2022 Nur-Sultan National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan made an extraordinary decision on the level of the base rate due to the need to maintain the price stability amid realization of the external sector risks with a significant deterioration in the geopolitical situation, which was considered as a part of the negative scenario and anti-crisis measure plans of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan. From February 24, 2022, the base rate is set at 13.5% per annum with an interest rate corridor of +/ 1.0 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities set on 14.5%, while the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 12.5%. The monetary policy of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan carried out within the framework of inflation targeting is aimed at preventing the spread of the consequences of an external shock to the country's economy, ensuring the macroeconomic stability and protecting the assets in tenge. The second-tier banks are provided with the necessary liquidity as part of monetary policy instruments. National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan remains committed to the free-floating exchange rate regime of national currency reserving the right to conduct foreign exchange interventions in case of excessive volatility to ensure stability of the financial system. At the same time, flexible exchange rate of tenge will ensure safety of the gold and foreign exchange assets, the importance of which has increased by the cause of realization of the external sector risks. As of 13:00 on February 24, 2022. National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan carried out foreign exchange interventions in the amount of 104 million US dollars. For this week, foreign exchange interventions amounted to 137 million US dollars. The measures to support tenge deposits of population are to be announced by the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan together with National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan. National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan continuously monitors the situation in the domestic money and foreign exchange markets, as well as world commodity markets and, if necessary, will take additional measures to ensure financial stability. The next decision of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on March 9, 2022 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time.

Russia,2022-02-28,"The Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to increase the key rate to 20% per annum from 28 February 2022. External conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed. The increase of the key rate will ensure a rise in deposit rates to levels needed to compensate for the increased depreciation and inflation risks. This is needed to support financial and price stability and protect the savings of citizens from depreciation. Further key rate decisions will be made taking into account risks posed by external and domestic conditions and the reaction of financial markets, as well as actual and expected inflation movements relative to the target and economic developments over forecast period. A statement by the Governor of the Bank of Russia in follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting is to be delivered on 28 February 2022 at 16:00 Moscow time. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Malaysia,2022-03-03,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 1.75 percent. The global economy continues to recover. Despite the recent moderation in economic activity due to the Omicron-driven COVID-19 resurgences, the overall recovery trajectory remains on track. Inflation in many economies remain elevated, due to both demand and supply factors. Going forward, more countries will transition to endemic management of COVID-19, hence supporting global growth prospects. The unfolding developments surrounding the military conflict in Ukraine, however, have emerged as a key risk to global growth and trade prospects, commodity prices and financial market conditions. The global growth outlook will also continue to be affected by developments surrounding COVID-19, risks of prolonged global supply disruptions, and heightened financial market volatility amid adjustments in monetary policy in major economies. Despite the challenging environment, the Malaysian economy expanded by 3.1% in 2021. Looking ahead, the growth recovery will strengthen in 2022, driven by the expansion in global demand and higher private sector expenditure, amid improvements in the labour market and continued targeted policy support. The expected reopening of international borders would also provide further support to economic recovery. The economic impact from the recent increase in COVID-19 cases due to the Omicron variant is expected to be considerably less severe than previous waves in the absence of stringent restrictions. Risks to the growth outlook remain tilted to the downside due to external and domestic factors. These include a weaker-than-expected global growth, ongoing geopolitical conflicts, worsening supply chain disruptions, and developments surrounding COVID-19. Headline inflation in 2022 is projected to remain moderate as the base effect from fuel inflation continues to dissipate. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to normalise to around its long-term average as economic activity continues to pick up amid the environment of high input costs. Nevertheless, core inflation is expected to be modest, with the upside risk partly contained by the continued slack in the economy and labour market. The inflation outlook continues to be subject to global commodity price developments amid risks from prolonged supply-related disruptions. The MPC considers the current stance of monetary policy to be appropriate and accommodative. Fiscal and financial measures will continue to provide support to economic activity. Amid the prevailing uncertainties, the stance of monetary policy will continue to be determined by new data and their implications on the overall outlook for domestic inflation and growth. Bank Negara Malaysia 03 March 2022."
Ukraine,2022-03-03,"The National Bank of Ukraine remains committed to its inflation targeting regime. However, now that the forced administrative restrictions are in place, market-based monetary instruments such as the key policy rate no longer play a significant role in the operation of the monetary and FX markets. With this in mind, the central bank has postponed its key policy rate decision. The key policy rate will therefore stay unchanged at 10%. When economic conditions go back to normal, the NBU will resume its regular Board meetings on monetary issues and continue to make key policy rate decisions and publish the Inflation Report and macroeconomic forecasts. The NBU will use the key policy rate and other monetary instruments to control inflation expectations and pursue the inflation target when monetary transmission channels go back into operation and it becomes possible to calculate, with reasonable probability, the impact of monetary decisions over the policy horizon. After Ukraine is freed from Russian invaders and the economy is back to operating on market-driven principles, the NBU will return to its traditional inflation-targeting mode with a floating exchange rate. The business-as-usual functioning of the FX market will be restored as soon as possible, and the FX restrictions will be eased to pre-war levels. However, this may take several stages."
Armenia,2022-03-05,"PRESS RELEASE 03.05.2022 Refinancing Rate Set at 9.25% At May 3, 2022 meeting, the CBA Board decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, setting it at 9.25%. In March 2022, 12-month inflation grew to 7.4%. 12-month core inflation grew as well, totaling 7.0%. The Russian-Ukrainian conflict continues, and the uncertainties related to it remain. This has a negative impact on the economic and financial market developments in the main partner countries of Armenia. The slower-than-expected slowdown in economic growth in partner countries is accompanied by an expansion of the inflationary environment. The latter is the result of value chain disruptions and accelerated inflation in international commodity markets. Thus, inflationary impact on the Armenian economy from the external sector will persist. In the first quarter of 2022, developments in the economic activity of the Republic of Armenia were more positive than expected. The significant influx of international visitors is reflected in the high growth of the service sector and the expansion of aggregate demand. It contributes to the improvement of the Republic of Armenia external balance and appreciation of Armenian dram in foreign exchange market. It is estimated that the latter will also have a positive impact on weakening the domestic inflationary environment and lowering inflation expectations. In view of the above, the Board judges appropriate to leave the refinancing rate still unchanged. The CBA Board is committed to take adequate measures to neutralize any possible risk of deanchoring of inflation expectations. It is projected that the 12-month inflation will gradually decline and will approach the target of 4% in the medium term. The CBA Board considers that as a result of geopolitical developments the high uncertainty related to the macroeconomic perspective remains. At the same time, the risks of inflation deviation from the projected trajectory are mainly balanced. Should the risks materialize in any direction, the Board stands ready to respond accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective. Detailed information on the basis for determining the interest rate can be found in the Inflation Report to be published by May 18, 2022 (Interest Rate Statement)."
Georgia,2022-03-08,"The National Bank of Georgia keeps its Monetary Policy Rate unchanged at 11.0 percent On August 3, 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) decided to keep the monetary policy rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged. The monetary policy rate stands at 11.0 percent. Elevated inflation and inflationary risks still remain a current global challenge. The sanctions imposed against Russia and the additional supply-side disruption stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war have significantly raised international prices on food, energy and other commodities. Elevated prices on international markets severely affected most countries, including Georgia, stoking inflation there. Despite the slowdown, inflation in Georgia remains high and amounted to 11.5 percent in July. Although recently prices on international commodity markets seem to have stabilized, uncertainty remains high and future trends largely depend on global geopolitical developments. Overall, under the influence of these factors, the inflation will tend to decline in the current and next years - but at a slower pace compared to the previous forecast - and other things equal, will gradually approach the target level from the second half of 2023. A faster decline in inflation is hindered by growing aggregate demand, to which high consumption makes a significant contribution. Economic activity continues to grow at a rapid pace, mostly driven by the record level of remittances, tourism recovery and strong credit activity. According to the preliminary data, economic growth in the first half of 2022 equaled 10.5 percent. In addition, against the backdrop of consecutive shocks, inflation has long deviated from the target level, which further amplifies inflationary risks. Despite the tight monetary policy, credit activity is still high during this year, due to excessive growth of consumer loans, on one hand, and foreign currency (FX) loans, on the other. Therefore, to slow down consumer lending, the Monetary Policy Committee considers appropriate to take additional macroprudential measures alongside tight monetary policy. In addition, it is expected that the implemented and announced interest rates hikes by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will have an effect on FX lending in Georgia similar to monetary policy tightening. Under such circumstances, the NBG predicts 9 percent economic growth in 2022. Monetary policy will remain on the tight side until the risks of rising inflation expectations are sufficiently mitigated. Should inflation expectations rise further and/or demand-side pressures on prices exacerbate, further tightening of policy or maintaining the current tight stance for a longer time period may become necessary. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on September 14, 2022."
Poland,2022-03-08,"Warsaw, 8 March 2022 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 8 March 2022 The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.75 percentage points, i.e. to 3.50%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: ▪ lombard rate at 4.00%; ▪ deposit rate at 3.00%; ▪ rediscount rate at 3.55%; ▪ discount rate at 3.60%. After a strong growth of global economy in 2021, at the turn of the year economic activity has softened somewhat in some economies. At the same time, amidst improving epidemic situation in the United States and the euro area in recent period, economic condition indicators have improved in these economies. After the outbreak of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine, uncertainty regarding further course of global macroeconomic situation has increased significantly, including in Europe. This has been reflected in a marked deterioration of sentiment in financial markets and a depreciation of some currencies. Prices of natural gas, oil and coal, as well as prices of some agricultural commodities have increased again. At the same time, global supply chain disruptions continue and international shipping costs are still elevated. This will probably contribute to a further rise in inflation worldwide, which in many countries had reached high levels even before the Russian military aggression against Ukraine. Amidst a marked increase in inflation many central banks are withdrawing monetary accommodation. Central banks in the Central-Eastern Europe region have been increasing interest rates. The ECB keeps negative interest rates, although it has been reducing the scale of asset purchases. The US Federal Reserve signals a termination of asset purchases in March and a start of interest rate increases. 1/3 Available data indicate that economic conditions in Poland remain favourable. GDP growth in Q4 2021 stood at 7.3% according to preliminary estimate by Statistics Poland. Data on retail sales, industrial production and construction and assembly output in January point to economic conditions remaining favourable also at the beginning of 2022. Meanwhile, employment continues to increase accompanied by a marked rise in wages. The Russian military aggression against Ukraine and related economic sanctions constitute a significant uncertainty factor for future economic activity in the world and in Poland. Nevertheless, due to, among other factors, modest share of exports to Russia and Ukraine in Polish foreign sales, a continuation of favourable domestic economic conditions may be expected in the coming quarters. Inflation in Poland  according to Statistics Poland flash estimate  increased in January 2022 to 9.2%. Significant rise in energy and agricultural commodity prices and increases in regulated tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy have been the main factors behind markedly elevated inflation. At the same time, the ongoing economic recovery, including an increase in demand driven by rising household incomes, has had also a positive contribution to inflation. In turn, a curbing impact on inflation has been exerted by a reduction in some tax rates as part of the so-called Anti-inflationary Shield. In 2022, inflation will remain markedly elevated, which  apart from factors amplifying inflation so far  will be due to the economic consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In the coming years, together with fading of the impact of shocks currently boosting prices, inflation will decrease. The decrease in inflation should also be supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, since, in the Council's assessment, the recently observed market pressure on zloty depreciation is not in line with the fundamentals of the Polish economy. The Council became acquainted with the results of the March projection of inflation and GDP based on the NECMOD model. In line with the projection prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 7 March 2022, there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of 9.312.2% in 2022 (against 5.16.5% in the November 2021 projection), 7.0-11.0% in 2023 (compared to 2.7-4.6%) and 2.85.7% in 2024. At the same time, the annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 3.45.3% in 2022 (against 3.85.9% in the November 2021 projection), 1.9-4.1% in 2023 (compared to 3.8-6.1%) and 1.44.0% in 2024. 2/3 The Council assessed, that there persists a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. In order to reduce this risk, i.e. striving to decrease inflation to the NBP target in the medium term, the Council decided to increase NBP interest rates again. The increase of the NBP interest rates will also curb inflation expectations. Further decisions of the Council will depend on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy. NBP will take all necessary actions in order to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability, including above all to reduce the risk of inflation remaining elevated. NBP may intervene in the foreign exchange market, in particular to limit fluctuations of the zloty exchange rate that are inconsistent with the direction of monetary policy. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  March 2022."
Kazakhstan,2022-03-09,"Press Release  7 The base rate remains unchanged at 13.50% March 9, 2022 Nur-Sultan The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has decided to set the base rate at 13.50% per annum with an interest rate corridor of +/- 1.00 p.p. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities set at 14.50%, and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 12.50%. The decision to keep the rate unchanged is driven by the fact that the current level already reflects the reaction of the National Bank to increased geopolitical risks and the risk of acceleration of inflationary processes. At the same time, the possibility for further tightening of monetary conditions in case of further deterioration of external and internal macroeconomic situation remains. The National Bank continues to take measures to ensure stability of macroeconomic situation in the financial market of Kazakhstan as well. Annual inflation rose to 8.7% in February 2022 (8.5% in January 2022) amid rising prices across all components of inflation. Food prices rose by 10% (from 9.9% in January this year) due to the rise in prices of bakery products, cereals and vegetables. Non-food inflation increased to 8.6% (8.5%). The high growth in prices for household appliances, furniture and household goods remains. With the temporary regulation of gasoline and diesel fuel prices, disinflation in the market of petroleum, oil and lubricants is observed. However, the growth of prices for POL in annual terms still remains at high levels (22.1%). Paid services rose by 7.1% (6.8%) in February 2022 compared to February 2021, due to an increase in the price of certain market services. The annual increase in the cost of rental housing amounted to 20.7%. At the same time, gas prices are slowing to 5.4% (December 2021 - 12.9%) amid a moratorium on price increases. The external sector is characterized by an extremely high level of uncertainty. The global economy is under pressure from geopolitical risks. In this regard, this year and next year the global economy is expected to grow at a slower pace than anticipated earlier. The situation on foreign markets is characterized by rising prices. Global inflation is likely to remain at high levels for longer than previously expected due to the sharp increase in prices for energy, metals, and agricultural products. For the first time since 2014 the world prices for Brent oil exceeded 100 USD per barrel. High prices are driven by the risk of disruption in oil supply from Russia due to increased geopolitical tensions. At the same time, there is a decrease in the world oil reserves on the background of high demand and weaker oil production by OPEC+ countries, where the actual production in January 2022 was again below the permitted quotas. The future outlook for the global oil market, despite the current heightened global uncertainty, remains generally positive. FAO food price index reached a historical record level in February this year amid significant growth in prices for vegetable oils, dairy products, cereals and meat. The cost of wheat renews 14- year high due to fears that the Russian-Ukrainian conflict will lead to a shortage of wheat on the world market. Rapidly changing geopolitical and external economic situation in the trading partner countries and the unprecedented level of uncertainty significantly hamper the capacity for comprehensive preparation of forecasts. In this regard, the forecasts of the National Bank were supplemented with expert assessments and were formed for a qualitative assessment of the likely direction of the main macroeconomic indicators. Inflation, according to estimates of the National Bank, will be higher than previous forecasts. The main reason for higher dynamics of inflation is the carry-over of the tenge exchange rate weakening in domestic prices due to the high share of imports in the consumption of non-food products. The external inflationary background is also forecasted to strengthen, first of all, against the background of expected acceleration of inflation in Russia and increased inflationary pressure in the world due to growth of prices for food products and energy resources. Thus, the risk of exceeding the target benchmark by the end of 2022 has significantly increased. Kazakhstan's economic growth trajectory is expected to be lower than previously expected due to the geopolitical crisis. The growth rate of the economy will be supported by high commodity prices, potential growth of budget expenditures, as well as improvement of the epidemiological situation. Further decisions on the base rate will depend on the dynamics of inflation and inflation expectations, the development of the geopolitical situation and the ensuing reaction of financial markets. The National Bank will continue to take all necessary measures to return inflation to the target levels. The next scheduled decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on April 25, 2022 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time.

Euroarea,2022-03-10,"Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. The Governing Council expresses its full support to the people of Ukraine. We will ensure smooth liquidity conditions and implement the sanctions decided by the European Union and European governments. We will take whatever action is needed to fulfil the ECB's mandate to pursue price stability and to safeguard financial stability. The Russia-Ukraine war will have a material impact on economic activity and inflation through higher energy and commodity prices, the disruption of international commerce and weaker confidence. The extent of these effects will depend on how the conflict evolves, on the impact of current sanctions and on possible further measures. In recognition of the highly uncertain environment, the Governing Council considered a range of scenarios in today's meeting. The impact of the Russia-Ukraine war has to be assessed in the context of solid underlying conditions for the euro area economy, helped by ample policy support. The recovery of the economy is boosted by the fading impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Supply bottlenecks have been showing some signs of easing and the labour market has been improving further. In the baseline of the new staff projections, which incorporate a first assessment of the implications of the war. GDP growth has been revised downwards for the near term, owing to the war in Ukraine. The projections foresee the economy growing at 3.7 per cent in 2022, 2.8 per cent in 2023 and 1.6 per cent in 2024. Inflation has continued to surprise on the upside because of unexpectedly high energy costs. The baseline for inflation in the new staff projections has been revised upwards significantly, with annual inflation at 5.1 per cent in 2022, 2.1 per cent in 2023 and 1.9 per cent in 2024. Inflation excluding food and energy is projected to average 2.6 per cent in 2022, 1.8 per cent in 2023 and 1.9 per cent in 2024, also higher than in the December projections. Longer-term inflation expectations across a range of measures have re-anchored at our inflation target. The Governing Council sees it as increasingly likely that inflation will stabilise at its two per cent target over the medium term. In alternative scenarios for the economic and financial impact of the war, which will be published together with the staff projections on our website, economic activity could be dampened significantly by a steeper rise in energy and commodity prices and a more severe drag on trade and sentiment. However, in all scenarios, inflation is still expected to decrease progressively and settle at levels around our two per cent inflation target in 2024. Based on our updated assessment and taking into account the uncertain environment, the Governing Council today revised the purchase schedule for its asset purchase programme (APP) for the coming months. Monthly net purchases under the APP will amount to €40 billion in April, €30 billion in May and €20 billion in June. The calibration of net purchases for the third quarter will be data-dependent and reflect our evolving assessment of the outlook. If the incoming data support the expectation that the medium-term inflation outlook will not weaken even after the end of our net asset purchases, the Governing Council will conclude net purchases under the APP in the third quarter. If the medium-term inflation outlook changes and if financing conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards our two per cent target, we stand ready to revise our schedule for net asset purchases in terms of size and/or duration. Any adjustments to the key ECB interest rates will take place some time after the end of our net purchases under the APP and will be gradual. The path for the key ECB interest rates will continue to be determined by the Governing Council's forward guidance and by its strategic commitment to stabilise inflation at two per cent over the medium term. Accordingly, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels until it sees inflation reaching two per cent well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at two per cent over the medium term. We also confirmed our other policy measures, as detailed in the press release published at 13:45 today. I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing, and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. The economy grew by 5.3 per cent in 2021, with GDP returning to its pre-pandemic level at the end of the year. However, growth slowed to 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2021 and is expected to remain weak during the first quarter of 2022. The prospects for the economy will depend on the course of the Russia-Ukraine war and on the impact of economic and financial sanctions and other measures. In the baseline of the staff projections, the euro area economy should still grow robustly in 2022 but the pace will be slower than was expected before the outbreak of the war. Measures to contain the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant have had a milder impact than during previous waves and are now being lifted. The supply disruptions caused by the pandemic also show some signs of easing. The impact of the massive energy price shock on people and businesses may be partly cushioned by drawing on savings accumulated during the pandemic and by compensatory fiscal measures. Over the medium term, according to the baseline of the staff projections, growth will be driven by robust domestic demand, supported by a stronger labour market. With more people in jobs, households should earn higher incomes and spend more. The global recovery and the ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support are also contributing to this growth outlook. Fiscal and monetary support remains critical, especially in this difficult geopolitical situation. Inflation increased to 5.8 per cent in February, from 5.1 per cent in January. We expect it to rise further in the near term. Energy prices, which surged by 31.7 per cent in February, continue to be the main reason for this high rate of inflation and are also pushing up prices across many other sectors. Food prices have also increased, owing to seasonal factors, elevated transportation costs and the higher price of fertilisers. Energy costs have risen further in recent weeks and there will be further pressure on some food and commodity prices owing to the war in Ukraine. Most measures of underlying inflation have risen over recent months to levels above two per cent. However, it is uncertain how persistent the rise in these indicators will be, given the role of temporary pandemic-related factors and the indirect effects of higher energy prices. Market-based indicators suggest that energy prices will stay high for longer than previously expected but will moderate over the course of the projection horizon. Price pressures stemming from global supply bottlenecks should also subside. Labour market conditions have continued to improve, with unemployment falling to 6.8 per cent in January. Even though labour shortages are affecting more and more sectors, wage growth remains muted overall. Over time, the return of the economy to full capacity should support somewhat faster growth in wages. Various measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets and from surveys stand at around two per cent. These factors will also contribute further to underlying inflation and will help headline inflation to settle durably at our two per cent target. The risks to the economic outlook have increased substantially with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and are tilted to the downside. While risks relating to the pandemic have declined, the war in Ukraine may have a stronger effect on economic sentiment and could worsen supply-side constraints again. Persistently high energy costs, together with a loss of confidence, could drag down demand more than expected and constrain consumption and investment. The same factors are risks to the outlook for inflation, which are on the upside in the near term. The war in Ukraine is a substantial upside risk, especially to energy prices. If price pressures feed through into higher than anticipated wage rises or if there are adverse persistent supply-side implications, inflation could also turn out to be higher over the medium term. However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term, this could also lower pressures on prices. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused substantial volatility in financial markets. Following the outbreak of the war, risk-free market interest rates have partially reversed the increase observed since our February meeting and equity prices have fallen. The financial sanctions against Russia, including the exclusion of some Russian banks from SWIFT, have so far not caused severe strains in money markets or liquidity shortages in the euro area banking system. Bank balance sheets remain healthy overall, owing to robust capital positions and fewer non-performing loans. Bank lending rates for firms have increased somewhat, while lending rates for household mortgages remain steady at historically low levels. Lending flows to firms have declined after increasing strongly in the last quarter of 2021. Lending to households is holding up, especially for house purchases. Summing up, the Russian invasion of Ukraine will negatively affect the euro area economy and has significantly increased uncertainty. If the baseline of the staff projections materialises, the economy should continue to rebound thanks to the declining impact of the pandemic and the prospect of solid domestic demand and strong labour markets. Fiscal measures, including at the European Union level, would also help to shield the economy. Based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook and taking into account the uncertain environment, we revised our schedule for net asset purchases over the coming months and confirmed all our other policy measures. The calibration of our policies will remain data-dependent and reflect our evolving assessment of the outlook. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments to ensure that inflation stabilises at our two per cent target over the medium term."
Peru,2022-03-10,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT MARCH 2022 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 4.0% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 50 bps to 4.0 percent, thus continuing to normalize its monetary policy stance. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation was 6.15 percent in February, temporarily above the target range due mainly to a surge in international food and fuel prices, as well as exchange rate depreciation. Year-on-year core inflation was 3.26 percent in February, above the upper limit of the target range. With the significant increase in international energy and food prices so far this year, recently accentuated by international conflicts, inflation is expected to return to the target range in the first half of next year. The downward path of year-on-year inflation would begin in July of this year, as transitory pressures (exchange rate and international fuel and grain prices) recede, with economic activity below potential. One-year-ahead expected inflation for 2022 increased from 3.73 percent to 3.75 percent, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most indicators of expectations for economic activity remained in pessimistic territory in February. Global economic activity is improving, although at a slower pace due to the impact of COVID-19, persistent bottlenecks in the global supply of goods and services, and uncertainty in the pace of reversal of monetary stimulus in advanced economies. However, recent international conflicts have increased uncertainty in the recovery of the world economy and in the magnitude of upward pressures on commodity prices. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation expectations and economic activity, with an aim to consider, if necessary, changes in the monetary stance so that inflation returns to the target range over the forecast horizon. In a context of uncertainty, financial volatility persists, with BCRP policies aiming at mitigating it. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 2.50 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 4.50 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months that a financial institution carries out since March 11, 2022; and the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months. In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates based on the amount of the operations. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on April 7, 2022."
Armenia,2022-03-15,"PRESS RELEASE 15.03.2022 Refinancing Rate Set at 9.25% At the March 15, 2022 meeting, the CBA Board decided to raise the refinancing rate by 1.25 percentage points, setting it at 9.25%. In February 2022, both 12-month and core inflation fell in line with the CBA projection, totaling 6.5% and 6.4%, respectively. In the external sector, in the context of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, various sanctions have been imposed on Russia's economy. As a result, a significant increase in financial market volatility and uncertainty about economic prospects was observed. In the United States and the Eurozone slowdown of economic growth is expected this year, and economic decline is expected in Russia. At the same time, the disruption of the reviewed supply chains in the international commodity and food markets has caused a significant increase in prices. This is reflected in the formation of a higher-than-expected inflationary environment in partner countries. As a result, a mainly inflationary impact is expected on the Armenian economy from the external sector. The impact of the sanctions imposed on Russia, will be reflected in the significant slowdown of economic growth in Armenia. This will be mostly conditioned by the industrial decline. Total demand will be affected by declining remittances and sluggish external demand. A positive contribution from tourism sector is expected. Growing geopolitical risks in the region and the high uncertainty has led to increased volatility in the Armenian financial markets and bigger risk premium. The existing uncertainties were reflected in the inflation dynamics and inflation expectations as well. In view of the above, the Board judges appropriate to increase the refinancing rate by a relatively large step. The Board considers that amid the economic outlook uncertainties and provided the risks of rising inflation expectations persist, the need for possible tightening of monetary conditions in the near future will be considered as well. Due to this policy actions, 12-month inflation will gradually decrease and reach the target of 4% in the forecast horizon. The CBA Board considers that as a result of the geopolitical developments, the uncertainty in terms of macroeconomic perspective has significantly expanded. At the same time, the risks of inflation deviation from the projected trajectory are mainly balanced. Should the risks materialize in any direction, the Board stands ready to respond accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective. Detailed information on the basis for determining the interest rate can be found in the Inflation Report to be published by March 29, 2022 (Monetary Policy Program for the first quarter of 2022)."
Brazil,2022-03-16,"In its 245th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate to 11.75% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's scenario:. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. On the one hand, a possible reversion, even if partial, of the increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency would produce a lower-than-projected inflation in its scenarios. On the other hand, fiscal policies that imply additional impulses to aggregate demand or deteriorate the future fiscal path may have a negative impact on prices of important financial assets as well as pressure the country's risk premium. In spite of the more favorable public accounts data, the Committee assesses that the uncertainties regarding the fiscal framework maintain elevated the risk of deanchoring inflation expectations, but considers that this risk is being partially incorporated in the inflation expectations and asset prices used in its models. The Committee maintains the assessment of an upward asymmetry in the balance of risks. Taking into account the assessed scenarios, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 1.00 p.p. to 11.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2022 and, mainly, 2023. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment. The Committee considers that, given its inflation projections and the risk of a deanchoring of long-term expectations, it is appropriate to continue advancing in the process of monetary tightening significantly into an even more restrictive territory. The Committee's actions aim at curbing the second-round effects of the current supply shock in several commodities, which appear in inflation in a lagged manner. The current projections indicate that the interest rate cycle in its scenarios is sufficient for inflation convergence to levels around the target over the relevant horizon. The Copom judges that the moment requires serenity to assess the size and duration of the current shocks. If those shocks prove to be more persistent or larger than anticipated, the Committee will be ready to adjust the size of the monetary tightening cycle. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process and the expectation anchoring around its targets consolidate. For its next meeting, the Committee foresees another adjustment of the same magnitude. The Copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic activity, on the balance of risks, and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fernanda Magalhaes Rumenos Guardado. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting. **Values around the oil price average in the week before the Copom meeting and, after that, a 2% change per year."
United States,2022-03-16,"EDT March 16, 2022 Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects inflation to return to its 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. EDT March 16, 2022Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C. Williams. Vice Chair; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; Esther L George; Patrick Harker; Loretta J Mester; and Christopher J Waller. Voting against this action was James Bullard, who preferred at this meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.5 percentage point to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. Patrick Harker voted as an alternate member at this meeting."
Turkiye,2022-03-17,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 14 percent. Geopolitical risks that evolved into conflict and the variants, keep the downside risks to regional and global economic activity alive and further increases the uncertainty. Recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors that have become more evident particulary in energy, and high transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand. Accordingly, while monetary policy communication of central banks in advanced economies varies with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they still continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs at a slower pace. Level of capacity utilization and other leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of robust external demand even some regional differences emerge. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, risks on current account balance due to energy prices are closely monitored. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The Committee also assesses that the credit growth including the long-term investment loans and targeted usage of accessed funds for real economic activity is important for financial stability. Increase in inflation in the recent period has been driven by rising energy costs resulting from the heightened regional conflict, temporary effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, supply side factors such as the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices, supply constraints, and demand developments. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively pursued for sustainable price and financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the base effect and the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. While cumulative impact of the recent policy decisions is being monitored, to create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Russia,2022-03-18,"On 18 March 2022, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 20% per annum. Against the background of a drastic change in external conditions, the sharp increase in the Bank of Russia key rate of 28 February helped sustain financial stability and prevented uncontrolled price rises. The Russian economy is entering the phase of a large-scale structural transformation, which will be accompanied by a temporary but inevitable period of increased inflation, mainly related to adjustments of relative prices across a wide range of goods and services. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy is set to enable a gradual adaptation of the economy to new conditions and a return of annual inflation to 4% in 2024. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation movements relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Financial stability and monetary conditions. The drastic change in external conditions for the Russian economy that occurred at the end of February has created threats to financial stability. The Bank of Russia's decision to increase in the key rate on 28 February and capital controls helped support the stable functioning of the Russian financial system. Deposit rates are up significantly. This was instrumental in restoring the inflow of funds into fixed-term ruble deposits and stabilised household demand for cash. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy helps make deposits more attractive, increasing households' propensity to save. Rising loan rates and more rigid borrower requirements in the context of higher uncertainty have led to a significant tightening in bank lending conditions. Against this background, a considerable weakening in credit activity is expected in the coming months. At the same time, the measures taken by the Bank of Russia to stabilise the financial market and regulatory relaxations will combine with the Government's subsidised lending programmes to maintain the availability of credit resources for businesses, especially in the most vulnerable sectors, and reduce the scale of the expected economic downturn. Inflation movements. Weekly estimates show that inflation has significantly accelerated since early March. Current price movements are largely driven by a surge in consumer demand for individual product categories against the background of higher uncertainty and rising inflation expectations, as well as the weakening of the ruble since the beginning of 2022. The Russian economy is entering the phase of a large-scale structural transformation, which will be accompanied by a temporary but inevitable period of increased inflation, mainly related to adjustments of relative prices across a wide range of products and services. Business adaptation to the change in external conditions, including a changeover in production and supply chains, will become a key driver for movements in relative prices in the coming quarters. Economic activity. Flash indicators, including the Bank of Russia's business survey, suggest a deterioration of the situation in the Russian economy. Businesses in many industries are reporting production and logistic difficulties amid the trade and financial restrictions imposed on Russia. A sharp surge in uncertainly weighs heavily on the sentiment and expectations of households and businesses. According to Bank of Russia estimates. GDP will reduce over the coming quarters. This decline will be mainly driven by supply-side factors, thereby producing a limited disinflationary effect. The stimulus measures being adopted by the Government and the Bank of Russia will limit the scale of economic downturn. A further recovery path of the Russian economy will be largely shaped by the degree and speed of its adjustment to new conditions. Inflation risks. Proinflationary risks have considerably increased and are now prevailing over the entire forecast horizon. In the short term, the effect of proinflationary factors is likely to be accentuated by high and unanchored inflation expectations. Over a longer horizon, the Russian economy faces considerable uncertainty regarding the speed and scale of the adjustment of aggregate supply in response to the recent increase in trade and financial restrictions. Economic activity and inflation dynamics will be largely impacted by fiscal policy decisions. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy is set to enable a gradual adaptation of the economy to new conditions and prevent uncontrolled price rises. Considering the above, annual inflation will return to 4% in 2024. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation movements relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 29 April 2022. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the medium-term forecast are to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. Statement by Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina in follow-up to Board of Directors meeting on 18 March 2022.

Pakistan,2022-03-20,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement March , 2022. At today's meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the policy rate at.75 percent. This decision reflected the MPC's view that the outlook for inflation has improved following the cuts in fuel prices and electricity tariffs announced last week as part of the government's relief package. At the same time, high-frequency indicators suggest that growth continues to moderate to more sustainable pace. This moderation should help keep at bay demand-side pressures on inflation and contain non-oil imports, notwithstanding the significant uncertainty about the future path of global energy and food prices due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Since the last MPC meeting on 24th January 2022, headline inflation moderated in February to 12. percent (y/y). Inflation in February would have been noticeably lower were it not for abnormal increases in few perishable items. Accordingly core inflation also fell in urban areas and inflation expectations have remained stable, suggesting that second-round effects from higher commodity prices remain contained. On the external front, despite the rise in global prices, the February trade deficit witnessed further 10 percent contraction (m/m) on top of the 29 percent decline recorded in January, confirming the slowdown in domestic demand. While the current account deficit rose in January, this largely reflected lumpy imports of oil, vaccines and other items financed through loans and supplier credit. Excluding these imports, the deficit would have been about $1 billion lower, suggesting that the underlying trend in the current account balance is also moderating. Looking ahead, the MPC noted that while current real interest rates on forward-looking basis are appropriate to guide inflation to the medium-term range of 5-7 percent, support growth, and maintain external stability, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has introduced high degree of uncertainty in the outlook for international commodity prices and global financial conditions. Continued adverse conditions on these fronts could pose challenges to the outlook for the current account deficit and inflation expectations, which could necessitate changes in the policy rate. Since the Russia-Ukraine situation remains fluid, the MPC noted that it was prepared to meet earlier than the next scheduled MPC meeting in late April, if necessary, to take any needed timely and calibrated action to safeguard external and price stability. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Real sector. Growth continues to moderate on the back of high prices and demand-easing measures. Since the last meeting, automobile sales and electicity generation have declined month-on-month. Sales of petroleum products and cement have also decelerated since last October. In the second quarter of FY22, growth in fast- moving consumer good (FMCG) sales dipped and general sales tax collections from services were lower than last year. On the supply side. LSM growth has been revised upward following the rebasing, settling at around 5-6 percent (y/y) since October. Agricultural prospects have somewhat weakened, with key inputs such as fertilizer off-take and water availability during the Rabi season lower than last year. Cotton and wheat Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN production will likely be less than previous estimates. Growth in FY22 is still expected around the middle of the previously forecast range of 4-5 percent. External sector. In January, there was sharp and broad-based decline in imports, including energy imports, to $6. billion from $7. billion in December based on PBS data. Imports declined further in February while exports rose, resulting in 38 percent contraction in the trade deficit compared to its peak last November. Around three-fourths of the rise in imports this year is estimated to stem from higher prices, with the contribution from volume growth negative in January. These trends suggest that demand-led pressures on the current account are declining. While the current account deficit rose to $2. billion, this included sizeable contribution from imports financed through loans and supplier credit, including oil and vaccines. Since these imports are concurrently financed with offsetting inflows in the capital and financial account, they do not undermine sustainability of the current account. Remittances fell marginally in January, partly reflecting seasonality, but have grown in line with expectations so far this fiscal year. Looking ahead, the non-oil current account deficit is expected to decline, as import growth continues to slow with moderating demand, while exports and remittances remain resilient. The outlook for the overall current account deficit is dependent on the path of international oil prices. Fiscal sector. At around percent of GDP, the fiscal deficit during the first half of FY22 was almost the same as last year. FBR tax collections grew strongly by 30 percent (y/y) during Jul-Feb FY22, in part due to depreciated exchange rate and higher imports than last year as well as strengthened tax collection efforts. This offsets declines in non-tax revenues due to lower petroleum development levy revenues and increased spending, including on subsidies, grants and provincial PSDP. While the primary balance posted surplus of. percent of GDP in the first half of FY22, it was lower than the surplus of. percent of GDP in the same period last year. Under the assumption that the recently announced relief package will not add to the fiscal deficit due to other offsetting savings, inflation should be lower through the rest of the fiscal year than earlier estimated. Monetary and inflation outlook. Private sector credit saw net retirement in January in line with seasonal patterns, and broad money growth also decelerated. Automobile and personal loans slowed further due to tightening of prudential regulations and increased borrowing costs. On the other hand, demand for loans for fixed investment and housing and construction continued to grow. Monetary conditions remain tighter in real terms, with private sector credit growth in negative territory. Headline inflation fell from 13 percent (y/y) in January to 12. percent in February, driven by slowdown in energy price inflation. The contribution to inflation from food prices rose, reflecting higher prices for tomatoes, fresh vegetables, chicken, and vegetable ghee. Meanwhile core inflation ticked down in urban areas and up in rural areas, while inflation expectations of both consumers and businesses remained broadly unchanged. The MPC continues to expect inflation to average between 9-11 percent this fiscal year before declining toward the medium-term target range of 5-7 percent in FY23 as global commodity prices normalize. This baseline outlook is subject to risks from the path of global prices, domestic wage developments, and the fiscal policy stance. The MPC will continue to carefully monitor developments affecting medium-term prospects for inflation, financial stability, and growth. Page."
Egypt,2022-03-21,"Press Release  March 21st, 2022 Special MPC meeting: MPC decides to raise key policy rates by 100 basis points In its special meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit rate, the overnight lending rate and the rate of the main operation by 100 basis points to 925 percent, 1025 percent, and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also raised by 100 basis points to 975 percen. Egypt's reform program has placed the economy on a strong footing to weather economic disruptions as they emerg. The hard-won macroeconomic gains have provided the CBE with a strong toolkit to implement its monetary policy and maintain price stability over the medium term and with solid buffers to insulate the economy from excessive volatilit. Nevertheless global inflationary pressures began to build after the world economy emerged from the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemi. These pressures became amplified with the recent Russia-Ukraine conflic. Rising international commodity prices resulting from further supply chain disruptions in addition to increased risk-off sentiment have added to domestic inflationary pressures as well as external imbalance. Being keen on safeguarding the achieved macroeconomic stability, the CBE stresses on the importance of the exchange rate flexibility to act as a shock absorber to preserve Egypt's competitivenes. In light of the above developments and given the CBE's monetary policy horizon of its inflation target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4, the MPC decided to raise policy rates by 100 basis points to reign in inflationary pressures while supporting economic activit. The MPC reiterates that the objective of raising policy rates is to anchor inflation expectations and contain second round effects of supply shocks stemming from exogenous factors outside the scope of monetary polic. Achieving low and stable inflation over the medium term supports real incomes and sustains the achieved competitiveness gains of the Egyptian econom. The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations, rather than of prevailing inflation rate. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to achieve its price stability mandate over the medium ter.

Nigeria,2022-03-21,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 141 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON MONDAY 21ST MARCH 2022 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 21st March, 2022, in an environment of heightened geopolitical tensions and persisting macroeconomic uncertainties, associated with the recent Russia- Ukraine crisis and headwinds stemming from the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee reviewed developments in the global and domestic environments in the first quarter of 2022 and the outlook for the rest of the year. These include the likelihood of tightening external financial conditions associated with monetary policy normalization in the Advanced Economies, the cocktail of sanctions imposed on Russia, global supply chain disruption associated with the invasion of Ukraine, and increasing vulnerabilities associated with the burgeoning global private and public debt portfolio and risks to financial stability. Others include increased uncertainties across major financial markets and the increased risk of continuing rise in prices confronting central banks due to the huge monetary and fiscal stimuli injected into the global economy to subdue the downside risks to growth. Ten (10) members of the Committee attended this meeting. Global Economic Developments The Committee noted with concern, the recent heightening of uncertainties confronting the recovery of the global economy as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and numerous sanctions against Russia, introduced a new dimension of risk to the tepid recovery of the global economy. It further took into cognizance, the lingering headwinds associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain constraints; rising inflationary pressure; and more recently, the progression of an interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve Bank and Bank of England (BOE). Members noted that the ongoing war and the resultant sanctions against Russia will continue to have a considerable impact on the global supply chain as both countries are major players in the global commodities market. With both countries significantly interconnected to the global financial markets, global capital flows are expected to experience some downturn, exacerbated by the increasing sanctions on Russia. Consequently the earlier projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for global output growth in 2022 and 2023 of 44 and 38 per cent, respectively, are likely to be revised downwards due to the overarching downside risks identified on the horizon. Price development across major Advanced Economies continued to trend upwards and is expected to be accentuated in the short to medium term, reflecting the persisting supply bottlenecks, rising food and energy prices, and the ongoing war which heightened the observed trend. In the Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs), inflation remained high, with some economies recording 2 inflation rates well above the average in the Advanced Economies. This was mostly due to a mix of downside risks from the COVID-19 pandemic, capital flow reversals, legacy structural challenges, supply-side bottlenecks, and exchange rate market pressures. In the global financial markets, investors maintained a substantial portion of their portfolios in gold and other precious metals, as the uncertainty around market securities persists alongside the Pandemic and the emergence of new risks following the imposition of sanctions on Russia. It is still unclear at the moment how the progression with monetary policy normalization by some key Advanced Economies will impact the recovery of the global economy, given the risks associated with this Crisis. Investors are however adopting a cautious approach in view of the impact of these developments on activities in the global markets. Global financial conditions are thus, expected to tighten in the short-term as the investment horizon gradually becomes clearer. This is expected to impact capital flows to emerging market economies as risk-averse portfolio investors adopt a wait-and-see approach. Consequently the risks to the overall recovery of the global economy remain heightened and call for cautious policy maneuvering to avoid a sharp downturn such as experienced in 2020. Domestic Economic Developments According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 398 per cent (year-on-year) in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 403 per cent in the third 3 quarter of 2021 and 011 per cent in the corresponding period of 2020. On a quarter-on-quarter basis. GDP grew by 963 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with 1107 per cent in the preceding quarter. This indicates the fifth consecutive quarter of real output expansion, following the exit from recession in 2020. The positive performance was driven largely by the growth in the non-oil sector to 1236 per cent in Q4 2021 from 1099 per cent in Q3 2021. Quarrying transportation & storage; education; financial & insurance services; information & communication; as well as a steady rebound in manufacturing and mining activities were key to the growth of the non-oil sector. The Committee, however, noted that although the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), remained above the 50-index points benchmark in February 2022, it moderated slightly to 501 index points from 514 index points in January 2022. This sustained positive performance in the manufacturing PMI reflects the resilience of the economy in light of persisting headwinds to the recovery. The Non-Manufacturing PMI, however, remained below the 50 index points in February 2022 at 490 index points, with a slight moderation compared with 4901 points in January 2022 as legacy headwinds such as the persisting insecurity and infrastructural constraints continued to impact production and the ease of doing business in Nigeria. The Committee observed with concern, the marginal increase in headline inflation (year-on-year) to 1570 per cent in February 2022 from 1560 per cent in January 2022, a 010 percentage point uptick. This increase was largely attributed to a rise in the core component to 1401 per cent in February 2022 from 1387 per cent in January 2022, while food prices moderated marginally. The rise in core inflation was mostly due to rising energy prices as a result of the current scarcity of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), rise in the cost of Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), and hike in electricity tariff. The Committee, however, expressed cautious optimism, that with sustained interventions by the Bank in various sectors of the economy and broad fiscal support to tame these legacy structural constraints, price development will moderate as output growth improves. The MPC, therefore, urged the fiscal authorities to seek innovative ways of addressing the current critical supply-side challenges confronting the economy, to enable the unhindered transmission of all the recently deployed fiscal and monetary stimulus to the real economy. Members noted that the growth rate of broad money supply (M3) increased to 212 per cent in February 2022, compared with 1. 74 per cent in January 2022. This was largely attributed to an increase in the growth rate of Net Domestic Assets (NDA) to 578 per cent in February 2022 from 262 per cent in the previous month. On the developments in the money market, the Committee observed the movement in money market rates around the asymmetric corridor, reflecting the prevailing liquidity conditions in the banking system. Accordingly the monthly weighted average Open Buyback (OBB) and Inter-bank Call rates decreased to 581 5 and 930 per cent in February 2022 from 600 and 1600 per cent in January 2022, respectively. The decrease in the rates reflected the liquidity conditions in the banking system. The MPC noted the sustained improvements in the equities market in the review period. The All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalization (MC) both increased significantly from 42,,71644 and N2230 trillion on December 31, 2021, to 47,,28267 and N2548 trillion on March 18, 2022, respectively. This prevailing positive performance was attributed to gradually improving macroeconomic fundamentals which support improved outcomes and returns on investments from companies quoted on the Nigerian Exchange Limited. The MPC also noted the continued resilience of the banking system, evidenced by the further moderation of the ratio of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) to 484 per cent in February 2022 from 490 per cent in December 2021. The Committee also noted that Liquidity Ratio (LR) remained above its prudential limit at 435 per cent in February 2022, while the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), moderated slightly to 144 per cent in February 2022 from 145 per cent in December 2021. Overall Members expressed confidence in the Bank's regulatory regime and commitment to maintaining stability in the banking system, urging the Management to sustain its tight regulatory surveillance. On the external reserves position, the Committee noted the decrease in the level of gross external reserves to US$3944 billion as 6 of March 17, 2022, from US$4021 billion on January 25, 2022, indicating a decrease of 195 per cent during the review period. The moderate accretion to reserves reflects the duality of Nigeria's position as an oil exporter and importer of refined petroleum products. The Committee reviewed the performance of the Bank's various interventions to stimulate productivity in manufacturing, industry, agriculture, energy, infrastructure, healthcare, and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Between January and February 2022, the Bank disbursed N2967 billion under the Anchor Borrowers' Programme (ABP) for the procurement of inputs and cultivation of maize, rice, and wheat, three crops that hitherto were significant concerns of FX demand. These disbursements bring the total under the programme to over 452 million smallholder farmers, cultivating 21 commodities across the country, comes to a total of ₦97561 billion. The Nigeria Commodity Exchange (NCX) has also been restructured to effectively aggregate excess outputs from the Bank's ABP-financed projects, with the objective of moderating food prices. The Bank also released N1915 billion to finance 5 large-scale agricultural projects under the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme (CACS), bringing the total disbursements under the Scheme to ₦73517 billion for 671 projects in agro-production and agro- processing. In addition to these, the Bank disbursed the sum of ₦42831 billion under the ₦10 trillion Real Sector Facility to 37 additional projects in the manufacturing, agriculture, and services sectors. The funds sourced from the Real Sector Support Facility - Differentiated Cash Reserve Requirement (RSSF-DCRR), were utilized for both greenfield and brownfield (expansion) projects under the COVID-19 intervention for the Manufacturing Sector (CIMS). Cumulative disbursements under the Real Sector Facility currently stand at ₦175 trillion, disbursed to 368 projects across the country. Under the 100 for 100 Policy on Production and Productivity (PPP), the Bank has disbursed the sum of ₦2951 billion to 31 projects, comprising 16 in manufacturing, 13 in agriculture, and 2 in healthcare. As part of its effort to support the resilience of the healthcare sector, the Bank also disbursed ₦850 billion to 6 healthcare projects under the Healthcare Sector Intervention Facility (HSIF), bringing the cumulative disbursements to ₦11672 billion for 124 projects, comprising of 31 pharmaceuticals, 56 hospitals, and 37 other services. An additional tranche of N147 million was disbursed to 5 researchers under the Healthcare Sector Research and Development (HSRD) Grant. To support households and businesses affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Bank disbursed N2166 billion to 19,,685 beneficiaries, comprising 12,,044 households and 7,,641 small businesses under the Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) within the period. The cumulative disbursements under the TCF stood at N39045 billion to 797,,351 8 beneficiaries, comprising 660,,096 households and 137,,255 small businesses. The Bank disbursed ₦1111 billion to power sector players, under the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Payment Assurance Facility (NBET- PAF), bringing the cumulative disbursements under this facility to ₦128 trillion. The sum of ₦1264 billion was also released to Distribution Companies (DisCos) under the Nigeria Electricity Market Stabilisation Facility – Phase 2 (NEMSF-2). The cumulative disbursement under the NEMSF-2 thus stood at ₦23293 billion. Both interventions were designed to improve access to capital and ease the development of enabling infrastructure in the Nigeria Electricity Supply Industry. Outlook The overall medium-term outlook for the global economy remains uncertain as the war between Russia and Ukraine persists, alongside the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The sanctions against Russia are expected to have a considerable backlash against the global economy as Russia is an interconnected economy both in the global commodity and financial markets. The extent of the backlash has, however, not fully crystallized but presents a significant downside risk to the recovery of the global economy if the crisis is not resolved immediately. Additionally the COVID-19 pandemic remains a significant downside risk to global recovery as the virus continues to mutate into highly infectious strains. This is imparting a high level of uncertainty on economic agents, thus, creating inhibitions towards making the 9 required investments to set the recovery on a sustainable path. As part of the lifting of restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the strong recovery of aggregate demand has continued to pose a strong upside risk to inflation, as supply bottlenecks persist. This has been further aggravated by sanctions imposed on trade with Russia and other blockages associated with supplies from Ukraine. Consequently inflation is expected to remain considerably high in the short term, even as some Advanced Economies progress with interest rate lift-off. The rise in both corporate and public debt in the Advanced Economies and Emerging Market and Developing Economies, is also a major threat to global financial stability as the risk of sustainability is heightened in the currently tensed global environment. Capital flows are thus, expected to be restricted as global financial conditions tighten over the short to medium term. In the domestic economy, available data on key macroeconomic indicators suggest the likelihood of subdued output growth for the Nigerian economy for most of 2022. This is hinged on the dampening impact to the growth of rising energy prices in the domestic economy; tightening external financial conditions as some Advanced Economies pursue interest rate lift-off; as well as the persistence of legacy security and infrastructural problems. It is, however, expected that monetary and fiscal stimuli will remain in place to continue to support the recovery until the downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation dissipate substantially. Accordingly the Nigerian economy is forecast to grow in 2022 by 324 per cent (CBN), 420 per cent (FGN), and 270 per cent (IMF). 10 The Committee's Considerations MPC noted with concern the impact which the global price increase in petroleum and other products is having practically on all economies. The Committee further noted that this has resulted in imported inflation on the Nigerian economy and believes that specific actions need to be taken to ensure that this trend does not continue given the adverse consequences and aggressive rising price level could have on the cost of living and purchasing power of Nigerians. Before the Russia-Ukraine war. MPC was optimistic that the moderate decline in inflation was sustainable due to the positive impact of good harvest on price levels. The MPC worries that, whereas global prices have gone up, this has been compounded by the shortage of supply of petroleum products. In the short run. MPC urges NNPC to take urgent steps to ensure an adequate supply of petroleum products in Nigeria so as to reduce the rate of arbitrary increase in the price of petroleum products by oil marketers. The Committee noted, with grave concern, the unprecedented rate of oil theft recorded in recent time, and its debilitating impact on government revenue and accretion to reserves. In the medium-term. MPC is hopeful that the proposed take-off of the Dangote Refinery in the course of the year would help to improve the supply of petroleum products in Nigeria. MPC also notes that the rising price of diesel is compounded by the problem of 11 inadequate electricity supply which has adversely impacted domestic prices. MPC advises the CBN Management and the fiscal authorities to take specific and urgent actions to avoid many power generating stations shutdown for turn-around maintenance, resulting in the current unwarranted shutdown of generating assets. MPC is relieved that food inflation declined marginally due to good harvest. Although some scarcity is expected as we approach the planting season, the Committee is optimistic that with the high level of strategic grain reserves of the CBN, it is relieved that food prices would remain relatively moderated. MPC further advised Management to redouble its developmental finance initiatives aimed at boosting domestic food output which would help in moderating food inflation going forward, thereby moderating headline inflation. The Committee's Decision While growth has continued to improve, members noted that inflation was confronted with upward pressure due to emerging risks within the domestic and external environment. The MPC, however, noted that the substantial upward push to price levels continued to be influenced by supply-side factors such as the scarcity of PMS, persisting insecurity and backlash from the Russia-Ukraine war. These require a careful and focused policy intervention to address and resolve. In this light, the MPC, urged the Bank to continue using the tools at its disposal, while increasing its collaboration with the fiscal authority to ensure that inflation is adequately reined in and growth is returned to a strong and sustainable path. 12 The Committee also encouraged the Bank to continue the use of its intervention mechanism to deploy funds to output-stimulating and employment-generating sectors of the economy. In its consideration as to whether to hold, tighten, or loosen. MPC remained concerned that the global situation on rising prices may continue in the near term but may begin to moderate if deliberate and urgent actions are taken by both the monetary and fiscal authorities to correct the rising inflation. On another hand. Committee was satisfied that the use of the Bank discretionary CRR policy should be deployed more aggressively to control the level of money supply in the economy. On tightening in order to rein in the rising price level. MPC was of the view that given the fragile state of the current GDP growth and the potential external and domestic headwinds from the Russia-Ukraine war, a contractionary policy stance would stifle the expected investment expansion needed to drive growth and absorb the shocks in Nigeria. MPC also feels that not only would tightening reverse the steady improvement recorded in credit expansion, it is also of the view that tightening would not necessarily tame the inflation, particularly where the marginal decline is relatively not yet sustainable. In the case of whether to loosen, the Committee feels that loosening would trigger further liquidity surfeit and fuel inflationary pressure as available funds outstrip the economy's absorptive capacity. MPC also feels that loosening would trigger FX demand pressure, as the 13 excess liquidity would exert demand pressure on the FX market and trigger a naira depreciation which would also fuel inflation. Based on the foregoing, the Committee decided to adopt a hold stance as it would indicate a precautionary and consistent policy stance with the prevailing economic conditions particularly as further economic and financial shocks are exerted from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. On the strength of the above considerations, three members voted to raise MPR by 25-basis points, one member voted to raise MPR by 50-basis points, while six members voted to hold all parameters constant. The Committee thus decided by a majority vote to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 115 per cent. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Retain the MPR at 115 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 275 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 21st March, 2022 14."
Philippines,2022-03-23,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility at 2.0 percent. The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were likewise kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. Latest baseline forecasts have increased from the previous monetary policy meeting, reflecting the impact of higher global commodity prices. Average inflation could breach the upper end of the 2-4 percent target range in 2022 at 4.3 percent, higher than the February forecast of 3.7 percent. Nevertheless, average inflation is projected to decline and settle within the target band at 3.6 percent in 2023. Inflation expectations have likewise risen but continue to be anchored to the 2-4 percent target band. While upside risks to inflation have increased for 2022, the balance of risks to the outlook remain broadly balanced for 2023. Upside risks over the near term continue to emanate from the shortage in domestic pork and fish supply as well as from the potential impact of higher oil prices on transport fares. In this regard, the BSP supports the implementation of social protection measures to alleviate the impact of rising crude oil prices on vulnerable sectors. Sustained initiatives to ensure adequate domestic food supply could also mitigate further supply-side pressures on inflation. Meanwhile, downside risks are linked mainly to the lingering threat of COVID-19 infections, as the emergence of new variants could temper the global economic recovery and prompt the reimposition of domestic containment measures. The Monetary Board further observed that domestic economic activity has gained stronger traction with the easing of remaining mobility restrictions. However, heightened geopolitical tensions and a resurgence in COVID-19 infections in some countries have also clouded the outlook for global economic growth. Supply-chain disruptions could also contribute to inflationary pressures, and thus warrant closer monitoring to enable timely intervention in order to arrest potential second-round effects. On balance, the Monetary Board sees scope to maintain the BSP's policy settings in order to safeguard the momentum of economic recovery amid increased uncertainty, even as it continues to develop its plans for the gradual normalization of its extraordinary liquidity measures. Given the potential broadening of price pressures over the near term, the BSP stands ready to respond to the buildup in inflation pressures that can disanchor inflation expectations, in keeping with its price and financial stability objectives."
Mongolia,2022-03-24,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Raising the policy rate No: 2022/02 Date: March 24, 2022 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia held scheduled meetings on March 23 and 24, 2022. Taking into consideration the current state of the economy and financial markets as well as outlook for the domestic and foreign economic environment, the MPC decided to increase the policy rate by 2.5 percentage points to 9.0 percent. The tension arisen in international relations recently has become an additional source of uncertainty in foreign and domestic economy. As the range of uncertainties widened, commodity prices especially prices of crude oil and food rose sharply in the international markets and supply chain disruptions are expected to persist, many countries are subject to risks of higher inflation and lower economic growth for this year than previously expected. Annual headline inflation reached 14.2 percent nationwide and 15.5 percent in Ulaanbaatar city as of February 2022. Elevated prices of food and petroleum in the international markets, transportation and logistic restrictions, which incur further transportation costs, as well as supply disruptions have been identified as the main factors explaining recent inflation developments. Though inflation has gradually decelerated in February consistent with our previous projections, current inflation outlook is being revised upwards due to the international tension arisen recently. Economic growth last year undermined expectations owing to reduced production activities in mining, transportation and construction sectors mainly caused by border restrictions, despite trade and service sectors supporting growth in line with easing of pandemic-related quarantine measures. Economic growth outlook in 2022 is expected to be negatively affected by higher production costs driven by surges in crude oil prices in the global markets, taking into account the current state of international relations, as well as constrained supply of production inputs resulting from anti-COVID policies being implemented by our main trading partner. Acceleration of external benchmark rate, worsening balance of payments and increased inflation expectations through prevalence of cost-push inflation that is triggered by higher production costs have necessitated implementation of policy measures with the aim to tighten monetary policy stance at a faster pace and improve relative yield on domestic currency. The Bank of Mongolia will take subsequent necessary actions in a timely manner in accordance with activities in foreign and domestic economy, inflation developments, supply constraints as well as the state of international relations. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Mexico,2022-03-24,"Available indicators suggest a moderation in global economic activity during the first quarter of 2022. World inflation continued increasing due to pressures originated by bottlenecks in production and to the high levels of food and energy prices. This environment has generated expectations of a faster withdrawal of monetary stimulus worldwide. Financial conditions tightened, with an increase in interest rates and a stronger US dollar, in a context of higher risk aversion associated with the recent geopolitical conflict. In its latest monetary policy decision, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points and announced that it expects to continue increasing it in the remaining meetings of 2022, although it pointed out that it will calibrate the pace of monetary policy adjustments if it foresees risks that may jeopardize the attainment of its goals. Many emerging market economies continued increasing their reference rates. Among key global risks are those associated with the pandemic, longer-lasting inflationary pressures, the intensification of geopolitical turmoil, and greater adjustments in monetary and financial conditions. In domestic financial markets, the peso slightly appreciated albeit registering some episodes of volatility, while interest rates increased accordingly to global developments. Available indicators suggest that the Mexican economy might have resumed its recovery during early 2022. An environment of uncertainty and ample slack conditions prevails, although the latter are expected to be less ample than in the previous quarter. In addition to the shocks that have affected inflation throughout the health emergency there are pressures associated with the geopolitical conflict. During the first fortnight of March, headline and core inflation registered annual variations of 7.29% and 6.68%, respectively, while their expectations for 2022 and 2023 increased again. Medium-term expectations for headline inflation were revised upwards at the margin, while those for core inflation were left unchanged and longer-term expectations have remained stable at levels above the target. Given the greater inflation pressures, forecasts for headline and core inflation were revised significantly upwards for the entire horizon and convergence to the 3% target is now expected to be attained in the first quarter of 2024 (see table). These projections are subject to risks. On the upside: persistence of core inflation at high levels; external inflationary pressures associated with the pandemic; increases in agricultural and livestock product prices and in energy prices due to the recent geopolitical conflict; exchange rate depreciation; and cost-related pressures. On the downside: a decline in the intensity of the war conflict; a greater-than-expected effect from the negative output gap; energy prices below 1 those anticipated; and exchange rate appreciation. The balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon has deteriorated and remains biased to the upside. The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and the factors that determine it, along with the risk of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and price formation becoming contaminated. It also considered the challenges posed by the ongoing tightening of global monetary and financial conditions, and the environment of significant uncertainty and greater inflationary pressures associated with the geopolitical conflict. Based on these considerations, and with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 6.5%. With this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon. For the next monetary policy decisions, the Board will monitor thoroughly the behavior of inflationary pressures as well as of all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations. The latter, in order to take the necessary actions to avoid the price formation process from becoming contaminated, and set a policy rate that is consistent at all times with the trajectory needed to facilitate the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets. 2/ Forecast starting February 2022.

South Africa,2022-03-24,"PRESS STATEMENT 24 March 2022 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since January, the Omicron wave of the covid-19 virus has transmitted globally with diverse social and economic outcomes. Despite the high infection rate, many economies remained open and, with some exceptions, the economic costs of the virus continue to fall. Even as the economic impact of the pandemic fades, the outbreak of war in February between Russia and Ukraine is expected to reduce global economic growth and contribute to higher inflation. The war will likely impair production of a wide range of energy, food and other commodities and further disrupt global trade. The SARB's forecast for global growth in 2022 is revised down to 3.7% (down from 4.4%), and for 2023 is lowered to 2.8% (from 3.3%), as a result of the war and the ongoing spread of the virus in Asia and elsewhere.1 For 2024, global growth is unchanged at 2.7%.2 Dramatically higher oil, commodity and food prices, additional 1 The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) January forecast for global growth in 2022 was 4.4%. The April forecast for 2022 will be released in a few weeks. 2 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. MPC Statement 24 March 2022 Page 1 constraints to trade and finance, and rising debt costs, create more adverse economic conditions for most emerging and developing economies. Although policy settings in advanced economies remain broadly accommodative, the onset of policy normalization by major central banks and higher inflation has tightened global financial conditions. Investor appetite for riskier assets is lower. Economies that failed to take advantage of better global conditions or to reduce large macroeconomic imbalances remain vulnerable. Last year saw the ongoing recovery of the South African economy from the pandemic, expanding by 4.9% for 2021 as a whole, marginally higher than the 4.8% we had forecast in January. The South African economy is expected to grow by 2.0% in 2022, revised up from 1.7% at the time of the January meeting. This is due to a combination of factors, including stronger growth in 2021 and higher commodity export prices. Growth in output in the first quarter of this year is likely to be significantly stronger than expected at the time of the January meeting.3 GDP growth is forecast to be 1.9% in both 2023 and in 2024.4 Economic growth at these rates remains well above a low rate of potential growth still constrained by loadshedding and policy uncertainty.5 Investment by the government sector has weakened significantly in recent years and that of public corporations is forecast to be very modest. Household spending remains supportive, as a result of good growth in 3 The January forecast for first quarter growth was 2.1%, seasonally adjusted and annualised. This has been revised up to 3.2%. 4 The growth forecast includes expected changes in the policy rate. MPC Statement 24 March 2022 Page 2 disposable income, rising asset prices, and low interest rates, while private investment has also proved to be more resilient than previously expected. Overall, and after revisions, the risks to the medium-term domestic growth outlook are assessed to be balanced. With the low rate of potential growth at present and the upward revision to GDP growth for 2022 and 2023, the output gap closes faster over the forecast period compared to the January meeting. The output gap is expected to turn positive after the third quarter of 2023. While important commodity export prices such as for coal, iron ore, platinum, and rhodium generally decreased in the latter half of 2021, they increased again late in January and have surged further with the outbreak of hostilities in Europe. Oil prices spiked to around US$130 per barrel in the early days of the conflict before easing somewhat. We expect oil prices to average US$103 per barrel for 2022. US$80 per barrel in 2023 and US$75 per barrel in 2024.6 South Africa's commodity price basket is forecast to rise by 8% for the year as a whole, keeping the terms of trade elevated, before falling sharply in 2023. As a result of these export and import price developments, the current account surplus is expected to increase to about 3% of GDP this year, before easing to 1.6% in 2023 and 0.8% in 2024.7 Although fiscal risk has eased, financing conditions remain tight and the yield curve for rand-denominated bonds is steep. Ten-year bond yields increased to about 10.3% in late February, before easing back to around 9.7% at present. 6 The Brent crude oil assumptions in January were US$78. US$72, and US$70, respectively. 7 In January, the current account surplus was expected to decline in 2022 to about 0.4% of GDP and to be in a deficit of -0.2% in 2023 (from -1.8%) and -0.6% in 2024 (from -2.5%). MPC Statement 24 March 2022 Page 3 The first two months of this year featured a weaker rand exchange rate, resting somewhat below its equilibrium level. Since then, and despite less favourable global conditions, stronger commodity export prices have appreciated the currency, and helped to dampen price pressures. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R15.41 to the US dollar, compared with R15.60 at the time of the previous meeting.8 As the global economy rebounded from the pandemic, aggressive policy easing and supply shortages have increased prices of many goods and commodities.9 These price increases have passed-through to services prices, wages, and consumer prices in major economies. Our estimate for inflation in the G3 is revised higher throughout the forecast period, to 5.6% in 2022 and to 3.0% in 2023 (up from 3.1% and 1.7%), before moderating to 2.3% in 2024 (from 1.6%).10 Oil prices are revised up further for this year, and fuel price inflation is higher at 26.1% (up from 13.7%). Local electricity price inflation is revised down to 11.0% for 2022 (from 14.5%) and to 9.2% in 2023 (from 12.4%). For 2024, electricity price inflation of 10% is expected, unchanged from the previous meeting. As a result of higher global food prices, local food price inflation is also revised up and is now expected to be 6.1% in 2022 (up from 4.8%), and 5.1% in 2023 (up from 4.6%). Food price inflation is forecast to ease to 4.4% in 2024 (down from 4.6%). The Bank's forecast of headline inflation for this year is revised higher to 5.8% (from 4.9%), primarily due to the higher food and fuel prices. While food prices will stay 8 The rand has appreciated by about 3.4% to the US dollar since the January meeting. 9 World food prices continue to rise. The assumption used for the forecast for USD-denominated world food prices in 2022 is revised higher from -2.3% to 6.8%. 10 The G3 comprises the United States, the Eurozone, and Japan. The latest CPI inflation in the respective components sits at 7.9%, 5.3% and 0.9%. MPC Statement 24 March 2022 Page 4 high, fuel price inflation should ease in 2023, helping headline inflation to fall to 4.6%, despite rising core inflation. Core inflation is forecast to increase to 4.2% in 2022 (up from 3.8%), to 5.0% in 2023 (from 4.4%), before easing somewhat to 4.7% in 2024 (from 4.5%). Core goods and services price inflation is forecast higher throughout the horizon, and services price inflation exceeds the mid-point of the target by the fourth quarter of this year. The risks to the inflation outlook are assessed to the upside. Global producer price and food price inflation continued to surprise higher in recent months and could do so again, particularly if the war in the Ukraine persists into the growing season. Oil prices increased strongly through 2021 and are up again sharply year to date, propelled higher also by the war and economic sanctions. Electricity and other administered prices continue to present short- and medium-term risks. Higher diesel and coal prices may result in upward revisions to our electricity price forecast for 2023. Given below- inflation assumptions for public sector wage growth and higher petrol and food price inflation, considerable risk attaches to a still moderate nominal wage forecast. Global financial conditions are more volatile at present and with higher than expected inflation, has pushed major central banks to start the normalisation of global policy rates. On balance, and with some exceptions, capital flow volatility is expected to remain high for riskier assets such as emerging market debt and currencies. Average surveyed expectations of future inflation have increased to 5.1% for 2022 (from 4.8%). Market-based surveyed expectations for inflation have also increased to MPC Statement 24 March 2022 Page 5. Market-based surveyed expectations for inflation have also increased to MPC Statement 24 March 2022 Page 5 5.5%.11 Long-term inflation expectations derived from the break-even rates in the bond market have also increased.12 In the near-term, headline inflation has increased well above the mid-point of the inflation target band, and is forecast to breach the target range in the second quarter. Headline inflation then returns close to the mid-point in the second quarter of 2023, taking into account the policy rate trajectory indicated by the Bank's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM). Some risks to the inflation outlook, like food and fuel, have been realised, and other risks, such as currency volatility and capital flow reversals, have become more pronounced. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 4.25% per year, with effect from the 25th of March 2022. Three members of the Committee preferred the announced increase and two members preferred a 50 basis point rise in the repo rate. The implied policy rate path of the QPM, given the inflation forecast, indicates gradual normalisation through to 2024. As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting in response to new data and risks. Economic and financial conditions are expected to remain more volatile for the foreseeable future. In this uncertain environment, policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. The MPC will seek 11 The (Q4) Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey expectations rose above the target midpoint to 5.1% (4.8%) for 2022 and 5.0% (4.7%) for 2023. Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) in March expect inflation to be higher at 5.5% (5.0%) in 2022 unchanged at 4.4% in 2023 and lower at 4.4% (4.5%) in 2024. 12 Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These now sit at 6.0% for the 5-year and 6.5% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year break-even inflation sits at 6.7%. MPC Statement 24 March 2022 Page 6 to look through temporary price shocks and focus on potential second round effects and the risks of de-anchoring inflation expectations. Current repurchase rate levels reflect an accommodative policy stance through the forecast period, keeping financial conditions supportive of credit demand as the economy continues to recover.13 The Bank has ensured adequate liquidity in domestic markets and will continue to closely monitor funding markets for stress. Better anchored expectations of future inflation could support lower interest rates, and can be realised by achieving a prudent public debt level, increasing the supply of energy, moderating administered price inflation and keeping wage growth in line with productivity gains. Such steps will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy.

Contact person: Thoraya Pandy 0824168416 media@resbank.co.za 13 The forecasted trajectory for the repurchase rate implies a rise in the inflation-adjusted repo rate from -1.5% for 2021 to -0.9% for 2022, 1.3% for 2023, and 2.0% in 2024. The real repurchase rate calculation here is based on the 1-quarter ahead inflation forecast and are annual average rates."
Chile,2022-03-29,"Tuesday, 29th March 2022 Monetary Policy Meeting  March 2022 At its monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 150 basis points, to 7%. The decision was adopted by all the Board members. Global inflation has continued to rise, prompting the Fed and other authorities to accelerate the normalization of their monetary stimulus, despite a reduction in the world growth outlook. In this context, long-term interest rates have continued to rise further globally and stock markets have seen mixed results. In Latin America, stock markets and local currencies have shown some recovery, explained in part by higher commodity prices and a low basis for comparison. The invasion of Ukraine has significantly intensified uncertainty and boosted commodity price increases, especially for energy, foodstuffs, and some metals. Accordingly, the oil price has risen considerably to levels of around US$110 per barrel (+28% since the last meeting for the WTI-Brent average), while the price of copper is around US$4.6 per pound. In any case, for the time being, the main economic and financial repercussions have remained confined to the parties directly involved in the conflict and their neighboring countries. In the domestic financial market, since the previous meeting the peso appreciated and the IPSA rose. Long-term interest rates, after being relatively stable, began to rise by the end of February, mirroring the behavior of their external counterparts. Still, they remain somewhat below the highs of mid-October of last year. Local asset prices have had a limited reaction to the unfolding conflict between Russia and Ukraine, although local uncertainty indicators have risen once again. Local credit remains weak, with lending flows slowing down lately. According to the first- quarter Bank Lending Survey, this is occurring in the midst of tighter conditions in access to bank financing in all portfolios, especially for companies, and lower demand for funds. The balances of individuals' checking and demand accounts have been declining. All this occurs in a context of rising short-term market interest rates, consistent with the transmission of a more contractionary monetary policy given the higher inflation scenario and the increase in longer-term benchmark rates. Regarding activity, the closing of the 2021 National Accounts —in accordance with the new 2018 benchmark compilation— showed an 11.7% increase in GDP, that is, within the range projected in the December MP Report. The performance of domestic demand in the fourth quarter, plus data available from the beginning of the year, point to the economy already being on a downward path from last year's high levels of spending. It is worth noting the reversal in the levels of private consumption —in seasonally-adjusted terms— especially of durable goods. Last January's Imacec confirms this trend, with a marked decline in the levels of wholesale and retail trade activity. Services, on the other hand, have continued to consolidate their recovery in line with the greater openness of the economy. In the labor market, participation has risen again, with demand tending to stabilize. All this is taking place in a context in which consumers' and entrepreneurs' perceptions of the economic situation have become more pessimistic. Annual inflation rose to 7.8% at February, almost one percentage point higher than expected in the December MP Report, a difference that responded largely to increased core inflation, especially in goods. The short-term inflation outlook has been revised upward again, bringing annual inflation closer to 10%. Inflation expectations in the two-year horizon have remained above 3% for several months, a situation that will be monitored continually by the Board. The Board considers that, if the assumptions in the central scenario of the March Monetary Policy Report prove correct, future increases in the MPR would be smaller than those of recent quarters. In any case, this will depend on the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario. The Monetary Policy Report to be published tomorrow morning contains the details of the central scenario and related sensitivities and risks, together with their implications for the future evolution of the MPR. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be released at 8:30 hours of Wednesday 13th April 2022. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will be held on Wednesday 4th and Thursday 5th May 2022 and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours of this latter date."
Georgia,2022-03-30,"30.03.2022 The National Bank of Georgia raises the monetary policy rate by 0.5 percentage points to 11.0 percent On March 30, 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia decided to increase the refinancing rate by 0.5 pp. The monetary policy rate is 11.0 percent. The recent developments, in particular Russia's invasion in Ukraine and the resulting full scale war, have posed new challenges to the world economy that was still in the phase of post-pandemic recovery. The intensified inflationary risks amid a new shock have on a world scale slowed the projected pace of decline of already high global inflation. Georgia had an annual inflation rate of 13.7 percent in February. Reduction of inflation is expected from March, mainly related to the elimination of base effect of subsidy of utility bills. However, without the new shock, this reduction would have been much larger. The sanctions imposed on Russia due to military actions and supply-side disruptions have significantly increased the prices of a number of product categories on the world markets. First of all, against the background of increasing oil prices, there is a sharp rise in fuel prices, which is expected to have a significant impact on inflation. This fact, combined with high inflation for a protracted period, may translate into higher inflation expectations. In addition, amidst rising risks of lower external inflows, volatility in foreign exchange markets has increased, leading to additional risks in terms of inflation expectations. According to the current forecast, other things being equal, inflation will start declining from March, although will remain above the target during the year. The credit activity is expected to be moderately high during the year, despite tightened monetary policy and recent macroprudential measures. As for the aggregate demand, according to preliminary data in 2021 GDP grew by 10.4 percent. According to the previous forecasts, 5 percent growth was expected in 2022, however, from the current perspective, the growth rate would be in the range of 3-4 percent. Amid the expected slowdown in economic growth, inflationary pressure stemming from the aggregate demand will be weak and supply-side factors will remain dominant throughout the year. It should also be noted that in the light of current events, the scale of forecast uncertainty has somewhat increased. Due to the increased risks of high inflation expectations, the gradual increase of the monetary policy rate over the past year led to the tight monetary policy. However, in the face of even more intensified inflation risks and inflation being above the target for a long time, the Monetary Policy Committee considered it appropriate to increase the policy rate by 0.5 percentage points. Monetary policy will keep a tightening bias until the risks of rising inflation expectations are sufficiently mitigated. As for the foreign demand, after a significant recovery during 2021 and the beginning of 2022, certain risks emerged in this direction, which in the light of military actions are related to the expected reduction in foreign demand from Georgia's two important trading partners. According to the preliminary data, in January-February 2022, exports of goods have increased by 54.5 percent annually. In the same period, the revenues from international travel have increased approximately 9-fold year- on-year, although the decrease compared to the corresponding period of 2019 is still significant (34.3 percent). Goods imports have also increased against the background of activated domestic demand - in January-February 2022 by 47.2 percent annually. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on May 11, 2022."
Thailand,2022-03-30,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 2/2022 Mr. Piti Disyatat. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 30 March 2022 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent. The Committee assesses that the Thai economic recovery will remain intact in 2022 and 2023, despite impacts from sanctions against Russia which led to higher energy and commodity prices and a slowdown in external demand. Average inflation for the full year 2022 will exceed the target range but is expected to decline and return to target in early 2023 with energy and food prices stabilizing. The Committee assesses that recent increases in inflation have stemmed primarily from cost-push factors, while demand-pull inflationary pressures have remained subdued. The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting to help facilitate a sustained economic recovery. The Committee assesses that the Thai economy will continue to grow at the rate of 32 percent in 2022 and 44 percent in 2023 on the back of improving domestic demand and tourism. The impact of the Omicron variant outbreak on economic activities is expected to be more contained than previous waves. Sanctions against Russia have pushed the cost of goods higher but will not derail the overall recovery path. Nonetheless downside risks to growth remain, including prolonged shortages of raw materials in certain industries and the impact of higher prices on living costs for households and production costs for businesses, particularly toward vulnerable groups. The Committee will closely monitor developments in the abovementioned situations closely. Headline inflation is projected to be at 49 percent in 2022 and 17 percent in 2023. Inflation will exceed 5 percent in the second and third quarters of 2022, driven mainly by rising energy prices and the pass-through of food prices. However inflation is projected to decrease and return to the target range in 2023 owing in part to the assessment that the rise in energy prices would not persist. Upside risks to inflation remain, primarily from higher-than-expected oil prices and cost pass-through from producers to consumers. The Committee judges that the rise in inflation has been mainly due to cost-push factors. Meanwhile demand-pull inflationary pressures remain subdued in line with a slow recovery of income, and medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range. The Committee will continue to closely monitor inflation dynamics to ensure that medium-term inflation expectations will be consistent with the monetary policy target. 2 Overall financial conditions remain accommodative. Liquidity in the financial system remains ample, although liquidity distribution still varies across economic sectors. On exchange rates, the baht has depreciated relative to the US dollar due to concerns over the Russia-Ukraine war and the expectation of monetary policy normalization in advanced economies. The Committee will closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets, and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem, particularly through supporting SMEs in hedging against risks from exchange rate volatility. The Committee views that government measures and policy coordination among government agencies will be critical to support the economic recovery amid heightened uncertainties. Fiscal measures should support the economic recovery in a targeted manner, with a focus on generating income and alleviating living expenses for vulnerable groups. Monetary policy should contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions overall. Financial and credit measures have helped distribute liquidity and reduce debt burden, especially for those whose incomes have not yet fully recovered. The measures have included the special loan facility, asset warehousing scheme, and other measures by specialized financial institutions (SFIs). In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring in a sustainable manner to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers' long-term debt serviceability. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continues to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery. The Committee will closely monitor key factors affecting the economic and inflation outlook, namely, global energy and commodity prices, higher cost pass-through, and geopolitical risks that could elevate and pose uncertainties in the period ahead. The Committee stands ready to use appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary."
Colombia,2022-03-31,"The board voted 5-2 to raise the benchmark interest rate to 5.0%; two board members voted for a 150-basis point increase. The decision was based on the following considerations. Headline inflation continued on an upward trajectory, rising by 8.01% in annual terms in February. Food prices in particular increased in annual terms by 23.3%. Inflation excluding food and regulated items rose from 2.49% annually in December 2021 to 4.11% in February. The Russian invasion of Ukraine could intensify upward pressures on international prices for some agricultural goods and inputs, energy, and oil. Diverse indicators of expected inflation have continued to rise in this context. Banco de la Republica's monthly survey of economic analysts suggests expected headline inflation of 6.4% in 2022 and 3.8% in 2023. The most recently available data points to dynamic economic performance in the beginning of this year. The monthly economic tracking indicator (ISE) signaled annual growth of 7.8% in January. The Bank's monthly commercial and industrial survey suggested manufacturing growth of 15.1% in annual terms in January, while real commercial retail sales increased by 20.9%. The unemployment rate fell from 15.1% in February 2021 to 12.9% in February 2022. The technical staff revised its growth forecast for 2022 upward from 4.3% to 4.7%, suggesting that excess productive capacity in the economy should continue to close at a faster rate than previously expected. With this decision. Colombia's monetary policy authority has reiterated its commitment to the 3% annual inflation target. Fecha de publicacion."
Czech Republic,2022-03-31,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank increased the two-week repo rate to 5.00%, i.e. by 0.50 percentage point. At the same time, it increased the discount rate to 4.00% and the Lombard rate to 6.00%. Five members voted in favour of this decision and two members voted for leaving rates unchanged.. The decision of the Bank Board is underpinned by an assessment of the currently available information, which largely relates to the economic impacts of the war in Ukraine. The war has significantly changed the outlooks for the foreign and domestic variables included in the winter forecast. Consistent with the winter forecast was a substantial rise in market interest rates, followed by a gradual decline from the second half of this year onwards. In light of the new information, the Bank Board at its meeting today assessed the risks and uncertainties of the winter forecast as being markedly inflationary, especially in the short run. These risks also require significantly tighter monetary policy, and probably for longer than predicted by the winter forecast. The European economy, which was recovering from the coronavirus pandemic in early 2022, will be adversely affected by the military conflict in Ukraine. The conflict, coupled with the sanctions against Russia, has caused a sharp rise in energy, industrial and food commodity prices. It will also lead to longer-lasting problems with material and component supplies. Expected foreign industrial producer price inflation has thus shifted significantly upwards, especially for this year. For similar reasons, consumer price inflation in the euro area has also been revised upwards, albeit to a lesser extent. The expected negative effects of the war in Ukraine have also fostered a decrease in the outlook for economic activity in the effective euro area this year and the next. The prediction for foreign interest rates has moved upwards, especially for next year. The Brent crude oil price has been rising due to limited production since the start of this year. Its growth accelerated further after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The oil price outlook has thus increased substantially compared with the assumptions of the current forecast. At the same time, the euro has weakened slightly against the dollar, and so has its outlook. Domestic inflation increased markedly further in the first two months of this year, i.e. before the outbreak of war in Ukraine, and exceeded 11% in February. It was thus well above the forecast. This was due mainly to a surprisingly sharp rise in food price inflation, reflecting unusually high prices of world agricultural commodity prices together with unexpectedly strong growth in domestic agricultural producer prices. The war in Ukraine, which is one of the world's leading exporters of wheat, is generating additional price pressures in the food segment. The deviation of inflation from the forecast was also due to markedly higher growth in administered prices (especially energy prices) and fuel prices. Core inflation was broadly in line with the forecast. The inflation developments up to now suggest unexpectedly strong inflation pressures from the domestic and foreign economies, which are being exacerbated by the price shock due to the war. The winter forecast expected inflation to peak in the first half of this year and then moderate gradually, decreasing close to the 2% target over the monetary policy horizon, i.e. by mid-2023. According to the current estimate, however, headline inflation will rise further in the coming months of spring and remain very high for the rest of this year. GDP growth was in line with the forecast at the close of last year. As regards its structure, higher-than-expected additions to inventories were broadly offset by lower other expenditure items, household consumption in particular. The winter forecast expected the Czech economy to grow by about 3% this year and accelerate slightly further next year. According to our preliminary estimates, the outbreak of war in Ukraine will reduce expected economic growth to about one-half of that figure this year. Besides more subdued exports, the drop in external demand will be reflected in lower corporate investment activity in the domestic economy. Additional problems with supplies of some components and materials will aggravate the already significant supply-side constraints and have a sizeable impact on the domestic automotive industry in particular. In addition, further growth in energy prices and headline inflation is likely to weigh on household consumption this year. Industry continued to face problems at the start of the year. Corporations are suffering from strongly rising input prices. Nevertheless, growth in industrial production excluding the automotive industry was solid in January. Construction output rose again in January, as did retail sales excluding the automotive segment, which were up 10% following a downturn in December. The tightness on the domestic labour market is still increasing slightly. While the share of unemployed persons decreased in line with the forecast in January and February, the general unemployment rate fell somewhat faster than forecasted in 2021 Q4. Many firms continued to face labour shortages. Nonetheless, annual wage growth in the market sector slowed further in 2021 Q4 and was slightly below the forecast. The winter forecast expected the koruna to appreciate initially and then stabilise just below CZK 24 to the euro. In Q1, the koruna-euro exchange rate was slightly weaker on average compared with the winter forecast. The outbreak of war in Ukraine led to excessive exchange rate fluctuations and rapid depreciation of the koruna. The Czech National Bank reacted by intervening in the foreign exchange market in early March. Coupled with a calming of the financial market situation in recent weeks, this has led the koruna to appreciate. The CNB has not needed to intervene in the foreign exchange market for a while now. The CNB is therefore resuming its activities under the programme of sales of part of the income on international reserves, which was suspended while its foreign exchange market interventions were going on. In the managed float exchange rate regime, the CNB remains ready to react at any time to excessive koruna exchange rate fluctuations that would disrupt the smooth functioning of the foreign exchange or financial market or that would jeopardise price stability and financial stability in the Czech Republic. The CNB has sufficient international reserves to fulfil its monetary policy objectives and other duties. To sum up the materialisation of the winter forecast, inflation was 1.3 percentage points above the forecast in February. By contrast, the average wage in 2021 Q4 was 0.6 percentage point lower. Economic growth in the final quarter of last year and the share of unemployed persons so far in 2022 Q1 were in line with the forecast. The Bank Board assessed the risks and uncertainties of the winter forecast as being markedly inflationary, especially in the short run. This requires significantly tighter monetary policy compared with the current forecast, and probably for a longer period of time. The higher domestic and foreign inflation in the year to date and sharp growth in energy and commodity prices due to the war in Ukraine are inflationary risks, especially this year. Weaker anchoring of inflation expectations to the CNB's 2% target remains a risk in the same direction. Less restrictive fiscal policy related to the refugee crisis is also an upside risk to inflation this year. By contrast, worse future economic developments having an impact on the labour market and related lower demand-driven inflation are an anti-inflationary risk."
Romania,2022-04-05,"The Board of the National Bank of Romania, having convened for the meeting of 5 April 2022, decided:. The annual inflation rate continued to rise gradually in the first two months of 2022, contrary to expectations, climbing to 8.35 percent in January and to 8.53 percent in February, from 8.19 percent in December 2021. This time round, the exogenous CPI components had a disinflationary contribution overall, following the slower pace of increase of electricity and natural gas prices, amid a base effect and extended price capping schemes, which outweighed considerably the influences of the relatively more pronounced hike in fuel prices. VFE prices and administered prices. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate followed a faster-than-expected upward path in the first two months of 2022 Q1, going up to 5.2 percent in January and to 5.9 percent in February, from 4.7 percent in December 2021, mainly as a result of the step-up in broad-based increases in processed food prices. Therefore, the evolution of this component continues to reflect the effects of the surge in agri-food commodity prices and energy and transport costs, alongside the influences of persistent bottlenecks in production and supply chains, compounded by increasingly higher short-term inflation expectations, the resilience of demand in certain segments, as well as by the significant share of food items and imported goods in the CPI basket. Average annual CPI inflation rate and average annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP  inflation indicator for EU Member States) went up to 6.0 percent and 5.0 percent respectively in February 2022, from 5.0 percent and 4.1 percent respectively in December 2021. Economic activity continued to weaken more than expected in 2021 Q4, falling by 0.1 percent versus the previous quarter, but solely on the back of the marked deterioration in the performance of agriculture. The developments make it likely for excess aggregate demand to remain low during this period, in line with February expectations, given inter alia the implications of the new revision of statistical data on economic growth in 2020 and 2021. At the same time, annual GDP dynamics saw in 2021 Q4 a markedly stronger-than-anticipated decline, i.e. to 2.4 percent from 6.9 percent in Q3, but almost entirely on the back of the contribution of the change in inventories falling to a significant negative value. Household consumption made only a very slightly lower positive contribution  which thus remained particularly elevated , while gross fixed capital formation recorded a somewhat improved contribution. In turn, net exports made a slightly lower negative contribution to annual GDP dynamics, as the decrease in the change in imports of goods and services outpaced that of exports. Against this background, the annual increase in the negative trade balance decelerated considerably as against Q3, due also to the narrowing of the unfavourable differential between the dynamics of import prices and those of export prices. Conversely, the current account deficit widened in annual terms at a significantly faster pace, under the impact of the marked worsening of the secondary income balance, on account of a decrease in inflows of EU funds to the current account as compared to the same year-earlier period. Recent developments in high-frequency indicators point to a slight, probably temporary, recovery in economic activity in 2022 Q1, implying however the deceleration in annual GDP growth in this period as well, due to an ongoing base effect. Specifically, in January 2022, the annual dynamics of retail trade remained steady, being accompanied by a sharp decrease in the annual change in motor vehicle and motorcycle trade and especially in that in market services to households. By contrast, the annual dynamics of industrial output slightly re-entered positive territory, those of the value of new manufacturing orders doubled, whereas the volume of construction works posted a markedly faster growth. Moreover, the much stronger increase posted in January by the annual change in imports of goods and services as compared to that of exports was chiefly attributed to the unfavourable developments in external prices. However, this caused the trade deficit to surge by almost three times in January 2022 against January 2021 and the current account deficit to post an even stronger increase in annual terms, inter alia due to the mild worsening of the primary income balance. Labour market has also witnessed mixed developments in the recent period. Thus, the number of employees economy-wide rose slightly in December 2021 and January 2022 to a record high, whereas the ILO unemployment rate climbed to 5.7 percent in December 2021 and remained unchanged in January and February 2022, above the historical low touched in the summer of 2019. The labour shortage reported by companies posted, however, a faster increase January through March 2022, while remaining considerably below its peak. The hiring intentions for the following three months, as shown by the DG-ECFIN survey, increased in January-February, but saw a moderate downward adjustment in March, amid the high uncertainties generated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the retaliatory international sanctions. Looking at the financial market, the main interbank money market rates witnessed a faster pick-up in February and March 2022, reaching nine-year highs, following the new monetary policy rate hike, as well as amid the pronounced tightening of liquidity conditions and expectations on a further increase in the key rate. Yields on government securities saw their generally upward path steepen as well, posting marked rises in the early days of March, only partly corrected afterwards, given the abrupt deterioration of financial investor sentiment, especially vis-à-vis markets in the region, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and the imposition of international sanctions. At this juncture, the EUR/RON exchange rate also recorded an upward adjustment, albeit far more modest than those observed in the region, before quasi-stabilising at the new levels, in the context of the NBR's liquidity management actions, but also amid the subsequent relative abatement of volatility on the international financial market, underpinned inter alia by the Fed launching the policy rate hiking cycle. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector climbed further in double-digit territory during the first two months of 2022, reaching 15.8 percent in February and 15.49 percent over the period as a whole, from 14.31 percent in 2021 Q4. This was mainly ascribable to a renewed step-up in the particularly strong dynamics of the leu-denominated component  to a period average of 19.8 percent , to which added the faster pace of increase of forex loans. The share of leu-denominated loans in credit to the private sector widened to 72.5 percent in February. According to current assessments, the annual inflation rate is expected to rise somewhat more steeply in the coming months than anticipated in February, under the impact of supply-side shocks. Behind the renewed worsening of the near-term inflation outlook stand the much higher increases expected for fuel prices, and especially for processed food prices, mainly due to the stronger advance in crude oil and agri-food commodity prices, amid the war in Ukraine and the international sanctions in place. The inflationary effects thus exerted are foreseen to prevail in the near term over the substantial disinflationary impact presumably generated by the one-year extension of capping schemes for electricity and natural gas prices for households. However, significant uncertainties are still associated with how the impact of these schemes is assessed and included in the CPI calculation. Uncertainties and risks surrounding medium-term prospects increase, nevertheless, considerably owing to the war in Ukraine and the associated sanctions, which pose a new sizeable supply-side shock globally. This exerts divergent effects on inflation and economic activity domestically, mainly by compounding the energy crisis and the production chain bottlenecks, but also via other channels, such as economy and inflation dynamics in Europe/worldwide, consumer and investor confidence, as well as risk perception towards the region, with an impact on financing costs. A major source of uncertainties and risks also remains the absorption of EU funds  especially those under the Next Generation EU programme  that is conditional on fulfilling strict milestones and targets for implementing the approved projects. At the same time, the improvement in the epidemiological situation on the domestic front led to the end of the state of alert in the first 10-day period of March 2022 and to the lifting of all mobility restrictions, with favourable effects on economic activity. Moreover, uncertainties and risks are associated with the future fiscal policy stance, given the requirement for further fiscal consolidation in line with the commitments under the excessive deficit procedure, yet in a challenging economic and social environment domestically and globally, marked by the implications of the war in Ukraine and of the sanctions imposed on Russia, but also by the tightening trend of financing conditions. In the meeting held today, 5 April 2022, based on the currently available data and assessments, as well as in light of the very elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 3.00 percent per annum from 2.50 percent per annum as of 6 April 2022. Moreover, it decided to raise the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 4.00 percent per annum from 3.50 percent per annum and the deposit facility rate to 2.00 percent per annum from 1.50 percent per annum, as well as to maintain firm control over money market liquidity. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to keep the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to anchor inflation expectations over the medium term, as well as to foster saving through higher bank rates, so as to bring back the annual inflation rate in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat target on a lasting basis, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth in the context of the fiscal consolidation process. The NBR closely monitors developments in the domestic and international environment and stands ready to use the tools at its disposal to achieve the fundamental objective of price stability in the medium term. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 15 April 2022 at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board will be held on 10 May 2022."
Poland,2022-04-06,"Warsaw, 6 April 2022 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 6 April 2022 The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 1.00 percentage points, i.e. to 4.50%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: ▪ lombard rate at 5.00%; ▪ deposit rate at 4.00%; ▪ rediscount rate at 4.55%; ▪ discount rate at 4.60%. At the beginning of 2022, conditions in the global economy remained relatively favourable although the activity growth slowed down in some economies. Prolonged disruptions in international trade and high commodity prices had a negative impact on the global economic situation. Russian military aggression against Ukraine contributed to a substantial rise in uncertainty surrounding further global macroeconomic developments and led to a significant deterioration in sentiment. At the same time, prices of commodities continued to increase and disruptions in international trade intensified. Consequently. GDP growth forecasts for some economies have been revised downwards. Many economies continued to see a surge in inflation, which reached the highest levels in decades. High commodity prices as well as prolonged disruptions in global supply chains and international transport remain the main source of price growth. In some economies, rising prices are also driven by growing labour costs. As a consequence, core inflation is also increasing. Due to the economic effects of Russian aggression, inflation forecasts for the coming quarters have been significantly revised upwards. Amidst a strong increase in inflation, many central banks are withdrawing monetary accommodation. In March, the US Federal Reserve concluded net asset purchases and increased interest rates for the first time in 3 years. The ECB keeps negative interest rates, although it has been reducing the scale of asset purchases. At the same time, central banks in the Central-Eastern Europe region continue to increase interest rates. Following the strong GDP growth in 2021 Q4, available data point to continuing high economic activity growth in 2022 Q1, as indicated by data on retail sales, industrial 1/3 production and construction and assembly output. Meanwhile, employment continues to increase accompanied by a marked rise in wages. The Russian military aggression against Ukraine has contributed to weakening sentiment of economic entities and constitute a significant uncertainty factor for future economic activity in the world and in Poland. Nevertheless, due to, among other factors, modest share of exports to Russia and Ukraine in Polish foreign sales, a continuation of favourable domestic economic conditions may be expected in the coming quarters. Inflation in Poland  according to Statistics Poland flash estimate  increased in March 2022 to 10.9% which was mainly driven by a strong growth in the prices of fuels and other energy carriers, amid Russian military aggression against Ukraine. Earlier significant rise in energy and agricultural commodity prices and increases in regulated tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy have continued to contribute to markedly elevated inflation. At the same time, the ongoing economic recovery, including an increase in demand driven by rising household incomes, has had also a positive contribution to the price growth. In turn, a curbing impact on inflation has been exerted by a reduction in some tax rates as part of the Anti-inflationary Shield. In 2022, inflation will remain markedly elevated, which  apart from factors previously amplifying inflation  will be due to the economic consequences of the Russian aggression against Ukraine. In the coming years, together with fading of the impact of shocks currently boosting prices, inflation will decrease. The decrease in inflation should also be supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council's assessment, will be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy. The Council assessed, that there persists a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. In order to reduce this risk, i.e. striving to decrease inflation to the NBP target in the medium term, the Council decided to increase NBP interest rates again. The increase of the NBP interest rates will also curb inflation expectations. Further decisions of the Council will depend on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy. NBP will take all necessary actions in order to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability, including above all to reduce the risk of inflation remaining elevated. NBP may 2/3 intervene in the foreign exchange market, in particular to limit fluctuations of the zloty exchange rate that are inconsistent with the direction of monetary policy."
Peru,2022-04-07,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT APRIL 2022 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 4.50% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 50 bps to 4.50 percent, thus continuing to normalize its monetary policy stance. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation increased from 6.15 percent in February to 6.82 percent in March, above the target range, due to the upsurge of significant increases in international food and fuel prices. Year-on-year core inflation also rose, although to a lesser extent, from 3.26 percent in February to 3.46 percent in March, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The significant increase in international energy and food prices since the second half of last year, recently accentuated by international conflicts, has led to sharp increases in global inflation rates in magnitudes not seen in many years both in advanced and other economies in the region. Thus, inflation is expected to return to the target range between the second and the third quarter of next year. The downward path of year-on-year inflation would begin in next July, as transitory pressures (exchange rate and international fuel and grain prices) begin to recede, with the economic activity still below its potential level. One-year-ahead expected inflation increased from 3.75 percent to 4.39 percent, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most indicators of expectations for economic activity deteriorated in March. Global economic activity is improving, although at a slower pace due to the impact of COVID-19, persistent bottlenecks in the global supply of goods and services, and uncertainty in the pace of reversal of monetary stimulus in advanced economies. However, recent international conflicts have increased uncertainty in the recovery of the world economy and in the magnitude of upward pressures on commodity prices. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants, including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, with an aim to consider changes in the monetary stance so that inflation returns to the target range over the forecast horizon. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 5.0 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months that a financial institution carries out since March 11, 2022; and the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months. In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates based on the amount of the operations. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on May 12, 2022."
Russia,2022-04-08,"The Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 300 basis points to 17.00% per annum from 11 April 2022. External conditions for the Russian economy are still challenging, considerably constraining economic activity. Financial stability risks are still present, but have ceased to increase for the time being, including owing to the adopted capital control measures. There is a steady inflow of funds to fixed-term deposits. Annual inflation will continue to rise due to the base effect. Yet, the latest weekly data point to a noticeable slowdown in the current price growth rates, including owing to the ruble's exchange rate dynamics. The tightening of monetary conditions already in place is partly offset by the lending support programmes launched by the Government and the Bank of Russia, but it will continue to limit pro-inflationary risks. Today's decision reflects a change in the balance of risks of accelerated consumer price growth, decline in economic activity and financial stability risks. In its further key rate decisions, the Bank of Russia will take into account risks posed by external and domestic conditions and the reaction of financial markets, as well as actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, and holds open the prospect of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 29 April 2022. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the medium-term forecast are to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Israel,2022-04-11,"Economic activity remains strong. The labor market is robust and has returned to levels quite similar to those prior to the crisis. Inflation in Israel increased in recent months, but is significantly lower than inflation in most of the world. It is above the upper bound of the target range, at 3.5 percent over the past 12 months. One-year inflation expectations increased, and are around the upper bound of the target range. Longer-term expectations are anchored within the target range. Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel has weakened by 0.5 percent against the US dollar, and has strengthened by 3.8 percent against the euro and by 1.8 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The Research Department updated its staff forecast. In its assessment. GDP will grow by 5.5 percent in 2022 and by 4 percent in 2023. The upward trend in home prices continued to accelerate, with prices rising by 13 percent in the past 12 months. The war in Ukraine and the increase in morbidity in China are deepening the interruptions in the global production chains, increasing inflationary pressure, and leading to some slowdown in the pace of global economic activity. The Israeli economy is recording strong growth, accompanied by a tight labor market and an increase in the inflation environment. The Committee has therefore decided that conditions allow for the start of a gradual process of increasing the interest rate. The pace of raising the interest rate will be determined in accordance with activity data and the development of inflation, in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy goals. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, click here. Ongoing economic activity in Israel is continuing at a high level alongside the COVID-19 pandemic and the cyclical nature of the waves of morbidity. The labor market is robust and has returned to levels similar to those prior tothe crisis. This has been possible, in part, thanks to the adaptation of most industries to functioning alongside the pandemic. With that, there is some uncertainty regarding the expected intensity of economic activity in the short and medium term, in view of the risks of further morbidity cycles and the parallel development of new strains of the virus in the future, developments in Europe, and the political uncertainty and security incidents in Israel. Since the previous interest rate decision, the CPI increased by 0.7 percent in February. Inflation is above the upper bound of the target range, and was 3.5 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 1). Net of energy and fruits and vegetables, inflation is 3 percent, and with the further neutralization of the effects of taxation and regulation, it is 2.7 percent (Figure 2). The annual pace of inflation in both the nontradable and the tradable components continued to increase in recent months (Figure 3). Inflation expectations for the coming year from the various sources increased, and are around the upper bound of the target range (Figure 4). Expectations derived from the capital market for the second year are above the target range, and expectations for the third year converged back to around the upper bound of the target range. Expectations for longer terms are anchored within the target range (Figure 5). Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel has weakened by 0.5 percent against the US dollar, strengthened by about 3.8 percent against the euro, and strengthened by 1.8 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate (Figure 6). The Bank of Israel Research Department revised its staff forecast.[1] In its assessment. GDP will grow by 5.5 percent in 2022, and by 4 percent in 2023 (Figure 11). The adjusted employment rate is expected to continue increasing slightly, to 61 percent at the end of 2023. The inflation rate is expected to be 3.6 percent in 2022, and 2 percent in 2023. In addition, the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be 67 percent in 2022 and 65 percent 2023. The aggregate balance of the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey for March increased, and continued to reflect businesses' positive assessments of their situation (Figure 12).According to the survey, the net balance is also positive in the hotels industry for the first time in a number of months. In view of the continuing global production and supply chain difficulties, the intensity of the equipment and raw materials constraint reported by companies remains high, with a prominent increase in the manufacturing and construction industries. Total credit card purchases continued to increase in March, following some moderation at the beginning of the Omicron wave. Goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds) remain higher than before the crisis, and services exports remain very high (Figure 14). Goods imports are also high in all components (Figure 15). Labor market data for the first half of March (aged 15+) indicate further improvement. The adjusted employment rate increased to 60.7 percent (standardized for the deviation in the original biweekly data), reflecting a gap of about 25,000 employees (0.4 percentage points) from the average employment rate in 2019 (Figure 17). The broad unemployment rate (including those temporarily absent for reasons having to do with COVID-19 and those not participating due to dismissal or the closure of the work place since March 2020) declined to 4.5 percent in March, while the narrow unemployment rate declined to 3 percent (Figure 16). With that, the decline in the narrow unemployment rate was mainly due to the decline in labor force participation. The number of job vacancies continued to increase in February, and remains high (Figure 18). The number of filled employee posts (as of January 2022) has not yet returned to its precrisis level, but total demand for workers (number of job vacancies plus the number of filled positions) has returned to the trend line. Until now, the strong demand for workers has not been reflected in a significant economy-wide increase in wages. The pace of increase in nominal wages between the precrisis period and recent months (until January 2022) is similar to the trend of wage increases in the two years preceding the crisis. The upward trend in home prices continued to accelerate in recent months, with prices rising by 13 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 9), a significantly higher pace than in previous years. The volume of new mortgages taken out in February continued to increase, to NIS 11.2 billion (Figure 10). Alongside this, the annual increase in rents remained relatively moderate, at about 3 percent. There were increases in most equity indices on the domestic capital market. Government bond yields increased significantly, similar to the global trend (Figure 7). Corporate bond spreads continued to increase moderately, but remained at low levels relative to the global increase and by historical perspective. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, financing constraints among businesses of various sizes remained relatively low in all sectors. Globally, the war in Ukraine and the slowdown in economic activity in China due to the increase in COVID-19 morbidity there and policy's response to it, are deepening the interruptions in the global production chain, increasing inflationary pressures, and leading to some slowdown in the global pace of economic activity. In view of this, investment houses have revised their growth forecasts downward (Figure 21). The global purchasing managers' index declined in March, but continues to indicate expansion of economic activity (Figure 22). Equity and commodity markets traded at high volatility in view of global events, mainly those in Europe. At the beginning of the reviewed period, in view of concerns over the effects of the war in Ukraine, equity indices dropped sharply, but toward the end of the period, they again increased (Figure 29). There were sharp increases in commodity prices due to the war. In the bond markets, there were sharp increases in yields on the government bond curvesin view of the increase in inflation expectations and in expectations of monetary tightening. The volume of world trade in January, which still does not include the effects of the war in Ukraine, remain high, but an updated index by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and the export orders component of the global purchasing managers' index indicate a slowdown in world trade in March. The global inflation environment continues to increase. The inflation indices in most countries are significantly higher than the central bank targets, and in some of them, core inflation is also abovethe target, although at a lower level, due to the sharp increase in energy prices, which are netted out of the core indices. Monetary tightening around the world therefore continues. In the US, inflation remains high, at 7.9 percent (in CPI terms) as of February. In response, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, signaled that it would begin narrowing its balance sheet in May, and revised its interest rate forecast significantly upward. In the eurozone, the rapid increase in annual inflation continued, to 7.5 percent according to the first estimate for March. The European Central Bank left its interest rate unchanged, but accelerated the pace of tapering its purchasing programin the second quarter, and indicated that it may end in the third quarter. Alongside this, there are increasing assessments that the ECB will begin raising its interest rate later in the year. In a number of other countries where inflation is above the central bank target, there were increases in the interest rate (Figure 28). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on April 25, 2022. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. May 23, 2022. [1] The full staff forecast is being published separately. The Bank of Israel Research Department revised its staff forecast.[1] In its assessment. GDP will grow by 5.5 percent in 2022, and by 4 percent in 2023 (Figure 11). The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. May 23, 2022.

Euroarea,2022-04-14,"Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. Russia's aggression towards Ukraine is causing enormous suffering. The conflict and the associated uncertainty are weighing heavily on the confidence of businesses and consumers. Trade disruptions are leading to new shortages of materials and inputs. Surging energy and commodity prices are reducing demand and holding back production. How the economy develops will crucially depend on how the conflict evolves, on the impact of current sanctions and on possible further measures. At the same time, economic activity is still being supported by the reopening of the economy after the crisis phase of the pandemic. Inflation has increased significantly and will remain high over the coming months, mainly because of the sharp rise in energy costs. At today's meeting we judged that the incoming data since our last meeting reinforce our expectation that net asset purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) should be concluded in the third quarter. Looking ahead, our monetary policy will depend on the incoming data and our evolving assessment of the outlook. In the current conditions of high uncertainty, we will maintain optionality, gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy. The Governing Council will take whatever action is needed to fulfil the ECB's mandate to pursue price stability and to contribute to safeguarding financial stability. I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing, and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. The euro area economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2021. It is estimated that growth remained weak during the first quarter of 2022, largely owing to pandemic-related restrictions. Several factors point to slow growth also in the period ahead. The war is already weighing on the confidence of businesses and consumers, including through the uncertainty it brings. With energy and commodity prices rising sharply, households are facing a higher cost of living and firms are confronted with higher production costs. The war has created new bottlenecks, while a new set of pandemic measures in Asia is contributing to supply chain difficulties. Some sectors face growing difficulties in sourcing their inputs, which is disrupting production. However, there are also offsetting factors underpinning the ongoing recovery, such as compensatory fiscal measures and the possibility for households to draw on savings they accumulated during the pandemic. Moreover, the reopening of those sectors most affected by the pandemic and a strong labour market with more people in jobs will continue to support incomes and spending. Fiscal and monetary policy support remains critical, especially in this difficult geopolitical situation. In addition, the successful implementation of the investment and reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme will accelerate the energy and green transitions. This should help enhance long-term growth and resilience in the euro area. Inflation increased to 7.5 per cent in March, from 5.9 per cent in February. Energy prices were driven higher after the outbreak of the war and now stand 45 per cent above their level one year ago. They continue to be the main reason for the high rate of inflation. Market-based indicators suggest that energy prices will stay high in the near term but will then moderate to some extent. This is due to elevated transportation and production costs, notably the higher price of fertilisers, which are in part related to the war in Ukraine. Supply bottlenecks and the normalisation of demand as the economy reopens also continue to put upward pressure on prices. Measures of underlying inflation have risen to levels above two per cent in recent months. It is uncertain how persistent the rise in these indicators will be, given the role of temporary pandemic-related factors and the indirect effects of higher energy prices. The labour market continues to improve, with unemployment having fallen to a historical low of 6.8 per cent in February. Job postings across many sectors still signal robust demand for labour, yet wage growth remains muted overall. Over time the return of the economy to full capacity should support faster growth in wages. While various measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets and from expert surveys largely stand at around two per cent, initial signs of above-target revisions in those measures warrant close monitoring. The downside risks to the growth outlook have increased substantially as a result of the war in Ukraine. While risks relating to the pandemic have declined, the war may have an even stronger effect on economic sentiment and could further worsen supply-side constraints. Persistently high energy costs, together with a loss of confidence, could drag down demand and restrain consumption and investment more than expected. The upside risks surrounding the inflation outlook have also intensified, especially in the near term. The risks to the medium-term inflation outlook include above-target moves in inflation expectations, higher than anticipated wage rises and a durable worsening of supply-side conditions. However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressure on prices. Financial markets have been highly volatile since the war began and financial sanctions were imposed. Market interest rates have increased in response to the changing outlook for monetary policy, the macroeconomic environment and inflation dynamics. At the same time, so far there have been no severe strains in money markets, nor liquidity shortages in the euro area banking system. Although remaining at low levels, bank lending rates for firms and households have started to reflect the increase in market interest rates. Lending to households is holding up, especially for house purchases. Our most recent bank lending survey reports that credit standards for loans to firms and for housing loans tightened overall in the first quarter of the year, as lenders are becoming more concerned about the risks facing their customers in an uncertain environment. Credit standards are expected to tighten further in the coming months, as banks factor in the adverse economic impact of Russia's aggression towards Ukraine and higher energy prices. Summing up, the war in Ukraine is severely affecting the euro area economy and has significantly increased uncertainty. The impact of the war on the economy will depend on how the conflict evolves, on the effect of current sanctions and on possible further measures. Inflation has increased significantly and will remain high over the coming months, mainly because of the sharp rise in energy costs. We are very attentive to the current uncertainties and are closely monitoring the incoming data in relation to their implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. The calibration of our policies will remain data-dependent and reflect our evolving assessment of the outlook. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilises at our two per cent target over the medium term."
South Korea,2022-04-14,"The bank of korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.25% to 1.50%. Currently available information suggests that inflation has accelerated while the recovery of the global economy has somewhat moderated, affected by the Ukraine crisis. In global financial markets, government bond yields in major countries have risen sharply and the US dollar has strengthened, mainly due to changes in expectations about the pace of the US Federal Reserve's policy normalization. Stock prices have rebounded after a considerable decline. Looking ahead, the Board expects that the global economy will resume its trend of recovery, supported by the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in major countries, but sees it as likely to be affected largely by COVID-19 developments, global inflation movements, monetary policy changes in major countries and geopolitical risks. The Korean economy has continued to recover. Exports have sustained their buoyancy while facilities investment has slowed due to global supply constraints. Private consumption has recently shown modest improvement thanks to the easing of domestic COVID-19 restrictions, after having moderated. Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed remaining high. Going forward, the economy is likely to sustain its recovery albeit partly affected by the Ukraine crisis, as exports are expected to continue their solid trend of growth while private consumption is likely to improve. GDP growth this year is projected to be somewhat below the February forecast of 3%. Consumer price inflation has risen significantly to the lower-4% level due to soaring prices of petroleum products as well as the accelerating increase in the prices of industrial products and personal services. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) and the inflation expectations of the general public have increased to the upper-2% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain high in the 4% range for some time, and run substantially above the February forecast of 3.1% for the year overall. Core inflation is forecast to remain around 3% for a considerable time. In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate have risen significantly while stock prices have fluctuated considerably, mainly driven by global financial market movements. Household loans have decreased slightly and housing prices have fallen slightly, especially in the Seoul metropolitan area. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board will appropriately adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation as the Korean economy is expected to continue its recovery and inflation to run above the target level for a considerable time, despite underlying uncertainties in domestic and external conditions. In this process the Board will judge when to further adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to COVID-19, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, monetary policy changes in major countries, geopolitical risks, and the trends of growth and inflation."
Turkiye,2022-04-14,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 14 percent. The ongoing geopolitical risks keep the downside risks to regional and global economic activity alive and increase the uncertainty. Concern over global food security, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors that have become more evident particulary in energy, and high transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand. Accordingly, while monetary policy communication of central banks in advanced economies varies with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they still continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs at a slower pace. Level of capacity utilization and other leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of more robust external demand even some regional differences emerge. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, risks on current account balance due to energy prices continue. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The Committee also assesses that the credit growth including the long-term investment loans and targeted usage of accessed funds for real economic activity is important for financial stability. In this context, the Committee decided to strengthen the macroprudential policy set. Increase in inflation in the recent period has been driven by rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, temporary effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively pursued for sustainable price and financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the base effect and the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. While cumulative impact of the recent policy decisions is being monitored, to create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Pakistan,2022-04-20,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement April , 2022. At its last meeting on 8th March 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted in its statement the significant uncertainty around the outlook for international commodity prices and global financial conditions, which had been exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Given the unfolding situation, the MPC had highlighted that it “was prepared to meet earlier than the next scheduled MPC meeting in late April, if necessary, to take any needed timely and calibrated action to safeguard external and price stability. Since the last MPC meeting, the outlook for inflation has deteriorated and risks to external stability have risen. Externally futures markets suggest that global commodity prices, including oil, are likely to remain elevated for longer and the Federal Reserve is likely to increase interest rates more quickly than previously anticipated, likely leading to sharper tightening of global financial conditions. On the domestic front, the inflation out-turn in March surprised on the upside, with core inflation in both urban and rural areas also rising significantly. While timely demand-moderating measures and strong exports and remittances saw the February current account deficit shrink to $0. billion, its lowest level this fiscal year, heightened domestic political uncertainty contributed to percent depreciation in the rupee and sharp rise in domestic secondary market yields as well as Pakistan's Eurobond yields and CDS spreads since the last MPC meeting. In addition, there has been decline in the SBP's foreign exchange reserves largely due to debt repayments and government payments pertaining to settlement of an arbitration award related to mining project. Some of this decline in reserves is expected to be reversed as official creditors renew their loans. As result of these developments, average inflation forecasts have been revised upwards to slightly above 1 percent in FY22 before moderating in FY23. The current account deficit is still expected to be around percent of GDP in FY22. While the non-oil current account balance has continued to improve, the overall current account remains dependent on global commodity prices. The MPC noted that the above developments necessitated strong and proactive policy response. Accordingly the MPC decided at its emergency meeting today, to raise the policy rate by 250 basis points to 12.25 percent. This increases forward-looking real interest rates (defined as the policy rate less expected inflation) to mildly positive territory. The MPC was of the view that this action would help to safeguard external and price stability. The MPC also noted that SBP is in the process of taking further actions to reduce pressures on inflation and the current account, namely an increase in the interest rate on the export refinance scheme (EFS) and widening the set of import items subject to cash margin requirements. These items are mostly finished goods including luxury items and exclude raw materials. The announcement of these measures is expected soon and will complement the action taken by the MPC on interest rates today. Importantly, the MPC highlighted that Pakistan's external financing needs in FY22 are fully met from identified sources. Looking ahead, the MPC noted that today's decisive actions, together with reduction in domestic political uncertainty and prudent fiscal policies, should help ensure that Pakistan's robust economic recovery from Covid-19 remains sustainable.

Kazakhstan,2022-04-25,"10 The base rate was raised to 14% April 25, 2022 Nur-Sultan The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to set the base rate at 14% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1.00 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities set on 15% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 13%. The decision to raise the base rate reflects the National Bank's commitment to anti-inflationary policy at a time of rising inflationary pressures amid realization of geopolitical risks, rise in prices in the world, as well as in countries being the trade partners of Kazakhstan and their transfer to domestic prices. Positive fiscal impulse observed for the third year in a row remains a significant driver for inflationary processes. Annual inflation in March 2022 accelerated to 12% (8.7% in February 2022) due to the abovementioned factors. The annual growth rate of food and non-food prices reached 15.4% (10%) and 10.9% (8.6%), respectively. The cost of paid services rose by 8.3% (7.1%). The steady acceleration of inflation is characterized by rising prices for a wide range of goods and services, as evidenced by a significant increase in base inflation indicators in March 2022. Inflation expectations are not anchored and continue to show high volatility. The results of the March 2022 survey indicate a decrease in the optimism of population and a significant increase in inflation expectations, reflecting worsening geopolitical situation and weakening of the exchange rate of the national currency. The quantitative estimate of inflation for the year ahead is 11.4%. Fiscal policy will exert considerable pro-inflationary pressure. In 2022, the republican budget expenditures will grow by 23.6% with an average growth rate of 16.7% in the previous three years. Continued positive fiscal momentum will exert pro-inflationary pressure in both 2022 and 2023. The transfer from the National Fund to finance the budget deficit in 2022 will amount to 4.6 trillion tenge, which is comparable to the 4.8 trillion tenge in 2020, allocated amid COVID19 pandemic and a 2.5% contraction of GDP. Financing of the republican budget deficit from the assets of the National Fund will have a supportive impact on the exchange rate, but will lead to an increase in demand for imports and weakening of the fiscal position. Growth of economic activity in Kazakhstan in the first quarter of 2022 amounted to 4.4% in annual terms. After a slowdown in January amid the enforcement of the state of emergency across the country, there has been a positive trend in many sectors of the economy since February. Business activity was supported by high consumer demand. Retail turnover growth accelerated to 3.7% year- on-year in March 2022. Household consumption was also supported by growth in consumer lending and real household incomes. Monetary factors contribute to the growth of domestic demand as a result of implementation of anti-crisis programs to support the economy. The volume of new loans in the economy in Q1 2022 increased by 25.3% in annual terms (compared to growth of 46.8% in 2021). However, as the results of March 2022 showed, the increase in the rate is not a deterrent to lending in the context of increasing uncertainty and changes in the terms of lending. Banking sector will continue to adapt to the emerging economic conditions and changes due to potential mergers and acquisitions, as well as the shift in the model of behavior of economic agents from consumption to savings. On the external sector side, pro-inflationary factors are intensifying. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization's Food Price Index in March 2022 reached record highs since 1990 amid rising prices for all subsets of food commodities. Global food prices will remain elevated in both 2022 and 2023. This is due to continued uncertainty surrounding the geopolitical crisis, high global fertilizer prices, and rising costs due to supply chain disruptions. Forecasts for the global oil market demonstrate continued high level of oil prices. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates, oil inventories in OECD countries stood at 2.61 billion barrels by the end of March, slightly higher than the month earlier, but still near the minimum since April 2014. Given the shock in the oil market, the oil price forecast was raised significantly by international organizations. Hence, the price of crude oil will be formed in the range of $90-100 per barrel on average in 2022-2023. As a consequence of a substantial rise in food and energy prices, a significant increase in inflation in developed economies and countries that are major trading partners of Kazakhstan has been recorded, which will affect the increase in imported inflation. According to the forecast of the International Monetary Fund, global inflation is expected to remain high in 2022. Inflation in developed countries will be at 5.7% (the previous estimate being 3.9%), and in developing countries at 8.7% (the previous estimate being 5.9%). In 2023, amid an expected weaker global economy and lower energy prices, inflation in developed countries will slow to 2.5%, while in developing countries to 6.5%. The main risks to inflation on the near horizon are associated with significant fiscal impulse with positive economic dynamics, growth of domestic and external demand, increase in the world prices for food, raw materials and finished goods, high and unanchored inflation expectations, supply chain breakdown, import of high inflation from the countries that are Kazakhstan's major trading partners. In the future decisions on the base rate, incoming statistical data and the results of the May  June 2022 forecasting round will play the key role. There remains the room for further tightening of monetary conditions subject to the trajectory of inflation expectations, updated forecasts on inflation, aggregate demand and imports, as well as the risk of realization of possible additional inflation shocks. Based on the results of the decision, a press briefing of the Chairman of the National Bank of Kazakhstan will be held on April 27, 2022 at 11:00 Nur-Sultan time with the participation of mass media representatives. The next scheduled decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on June 6, 2022 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time."
Colombia,2022-04-29,"The board voted 4-3 to raise the benchmark interest rate to 6.0%; three board members voted for a 150-basis point increase. The decision was based on the following considerations. Headline inflation rose in March from 8.01% to 8.53%, while inflation excluding food and regulated items increased from 4.11% to 4.51%. Expected inflation for 2022 is around 7%, converging to the 3% target on longer time horizons. Expected inflation at year-end 2023 is 4% and forward 24 months is 3.7%. Economic activity continues to suggest significant dynamism in the Colombian economy. The technical staff has revised its growth forecast for 2022 upward from 4.7% to 5.0% and maintained its 2023 growth projection at 2.9%. The prospect of an accelerated increase to U.S. interest rates and the impact on international prices of Russia's invasion of Ukraine could lead to additional inflationary pressures. With this decision, the board has maintained a gradual but steady process of monetary policy adjustment with the goal of ensuring a progressive return to the 3% annual inflation target.

Russia,2022-04-29,"On 29 April 2022, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 300 basis points to 14.00% per annum. The external environment for the Russian economy remains challenging and significantly constrains economic activity. With price and financial stability risks no longer on the rise, conditions have allowed for the key rate reduction. Recent weekly data indicate a slowdown in current price growth rates on the back of a strengthening of the ruble and a cooling of consumer activity. Further inflation movements will be shaped by such impactful factors as the efficiency of import substitution processes and the scale and speed at which imports of finished goods, raw materials and components will be recovering. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy will take into the account the need for a structural transformation of the economy and will ensure a return of inflation to target in 2024. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia sees room for key rate reduction in 2022. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reach 18.023.0% in 2022, slowing down to 5.07.0% in 2023 and returning to 4% in 2024. Inflation movements. Although still high, current growth rates of consumer prices have slowed significantly after they peaked in the first half of March. The slowdown in inflation comes largely on the back of a stronger ruble and a cooling of consumer activity. In this context. April saw a decline in inflation expectations of households and businesses. Further inflation movements will be shaped by such impactful factors as the efficiency of import substitution processes and the scale and speed at which imports of finished goods, raw materials and components will be recovering. As of 22 April, annual inflation was 17.6% (vs 16.7% in March). In the baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia expects annual inflation to continue to increase in the coming months, due to the base effect, to total 18.023.0% in 2022. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy will take into the account the need for a structural transformation of the economy and will ensure a return of inflation to target in 2024. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will slow down to 5.07.0% in 2023 to return to 4% in 2024. A sharp tightening in monetary conditions in the first half of March has given way to their softening in several segments of the financial market. OFZ yields have decreased. Deposit rates are declining at an outrunning pace. At the same time, a growing risk premium factored into lending rates and more stringent borrower requirements of banks trigger the emergence of tight price and non-price bank lending conditions. Against this background, lending activity is decreasing, especially in the retail lending market. Today's decision of the Bank of Russia along with current preferential lending programmes of the Government will support the availability of credit resources in the economy and limit the scale of decline in economic activity. However, the disinflationary impact of monetary policy will remain in place. Based on Bank of Russia estimates, economic activity began to decline in March 2022. High-frequency indicators point to a contraction in consumer and business activity. After a temporary surge, consumer demand is decreasing in real terms, accompanied by a rise in households' propensity to save. The decline in imports due to the introduction of external trade and financial restrictions is outstripping the decline in exports. Despite the gradual change in the country and commodity structure of exports and imports as new suppliers and sales markets emerge, businesses are experiencing considerable difficulties in production and logistics. According to the Bank of Russia's baseline forecast. GDP will reduce by 8.010.0% in 2022. The decrease will be mainly driven by supply-side factors. In 2023, the Russian economy will begin growing gradually amid a structural transformation. However, the overall GDP change in 2023 will be within the range of (-3.0)—0.0% due to the base effect of 2022 Q1. In 2024. GDP will increase by 2.53.5%. Inflation risks. Though having decreased slightly, proinflationary risks are still considerable. They are primarily associated with a further exacerbation of external trade and financial restrictions. The decline in the potential of Russia's economy driven by restrictions may turn out to be more pronounced than the baseline scenario assumes. Over a short-term horizon, the effect of proinflationary factors is likely to be accentuated by high and unanchored inflation expectations. Disinflationary risks to the baseline scenario are mostly linked to the possible additional tightening of monetary conditions in the economy due to a consistently high risk premium in credit rates and elevated banks' requirements for borrowers amid high uncertainty. This may in aggregate lead to a greater slowdown in lending. Ruble exchange rate dynamics will remain a meaningful factor shaping the path of inflation and inflation expectations. The movements of the economy and inflation will also depend on future fiscal policy decisions. The Bank of Russia's baseline scenario rests on the decisions already made regarding the mid-term expenditure path of the federal budget and the fiscal system as a whole. Additional decisions changing fiscal policy parameters may influence the mid-term path of the key rate. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia sees room for key rate reduction in 2022. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting of 29 April 2022 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 10 June 2022. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Thailand,2022-04-29,"Press Release on the Economic and Monetary Conditions for March and the first quarter of 2022 The Thai economy slowed down somewhat in March 2022. Domestic spending from private sector declined both in consumption and investment, while activities in the manufacturing sector also slowed down. Several factors accounted for such development: the Omicron variant outbreak, higher production costs, and rising living costs. Meanwhile public spending declined from the same period last year both in current and capital expenditures of the central government. Nevertheless merchandise exports value increased in line with trading partners' demand. Foreign tourist figures also continued to increase after the relaxation of international travel restrictions. On the economic stability front, headline inflation increased from energy and prepared food prices. Labor market gradually improved but remained vulnerable. The current account became a surplus due to a larger surplus in trade balance, while the net service, income, and transfers registered a deficit close to the previous month. Details of the economic conditions are as follows: Private consumption indicators, after seasonal adjustment, decreased from the previous month, particularly in durable goods. This was consistent with worsening consumer confidence and household purchasing power as a result of the Omicron outbreak and rising living costs. Private investment indicators, after seasonal adjustment, decreased from the previous month in line with business sentiment. Weaker investment was from both machinery and equipment as well as construction categories, which was affected by higher prices of construction materials. Manufacturing production, after seasonal adjustment, decreased from the previous month, particularly in food and beverages, which accelerated in the preceding periods as well as in construction materials, which were affected by lower domestic demand due to higher prices. In addition, the production of integrated circuits, semiconductors and electrical appliances also declined due to a continued shortage of electronic parts. Public spending, excluding transfer payment, slightly contracted from the same period last year. Current expenditures decreased due to lower purchases of goods and services. Meanwhile capital expenditures of the central government also contracted mainly from lower disbursement of transportation and irrigation agencies after being accelerated in the preceding periods. The value of merchandise exports, excluding gold and after seasonal adjustment, increased from the previous month in several categories: agricultural products, metals, electronics as well as automotive and parts. This was thanks to the expansion of trading partners' demand along with the increase in export prices of some products such as rice and steel. Nonetheless exports of electrical appliances and agro-manufacturing products did not perform well as the former was affected by a continued shortage of electronic parts, while the latter was the exports of sugar which had already front- loaded in the preceding periods. The value of merchandise imports, excluding gold and after seasonal adjustment, increased from the previous month in all categories, especially raw materials such as fuel, fertilizers, metal and wheat that accelerated due to importers' concern about the supply disruption caused by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The number of foreign tourist arrivals, after seasonal adjustment, increased from the previous month in almost all nationalities after the country's relaxation of international travel restrictions. The number of foreign tourists from Russia and Eastern Europe were, however, plummeted as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. On the stability front, headline inflation increased from energy and prepared food prices. The energy inflation was in line with the development of global oil prices, while the food inflation was due to higher costs of food ingredients. The current account became a surplus thanks to a larger trade surplus, primarily due to higher gold exports, while the deficit in the net service, income, and transfers was close to the previous month. On exchange rates, the baht against the US dollar depreciated mainly as a result of intensified conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The Thai economy in the first quarter of 2022 improved from the previous quarter. The value of merchandise exports increased in line with the improvement in trading partners' demand. Foreign tourist figures also increased after the relaxation of international travel restrictions. Furthermore private consumption and private investment indicators continued to expand, but at a slower pace and were affected by the Omicron variant outbreak, higher production costs, and rising living costs. Public spending, excluding transfer payment, expanded compared to the same period last year from capital expenditures. On the stability front, headline inflation increased considerably from rising energy and fresh food prices as well as core inflation, which increased from the prepared food prices due to higher costs of food ingredients. The current account recorded a deficit close to the previous quarter."
Brazil,2022-05-04,"In its 246th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate to 12.75% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's scenario:. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; and an increase in the risk premium due to the uncertainty about the country's future fiscal framework, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset prices. Among the downside risks, it should be noted a possible reversion, even if partial, of the increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency; and a greater deceleration of economic activity than projected. The Committee assesses that the uncertain and volatile current scenario requires serenity when evaluating the risks. Taking into account the assessed scenarios, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 1.00 p.p. to 12.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment. The Committee considers that, given its inflation projections and the risk of a deanchoring of long-term expectations, it is appropriate to continue advancing in the process of monetary tightening significantly into even more restrictive territory. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process consolidates and anchors expectations around its targets. For its next meeting, the Committee foresees as likely an extension of the cycle, with an adjustment of lower magnitude. The Committee stresses that the heightened uncertainty of the current scenario, the advanced stage of the current monetary policy cycle, and its impacts yet to be observed require additional caution in its actions. The Copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto de Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Diogo Abry Guillen. Fernanda Magalhaes Rumenos Guardado. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza and Renato Dias de Brito Gomes. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
United States,2022-05-04,"EDT May 4, 2022 Although overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment remained strong. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain. The invasion and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are likely to weigh on economic activity. In addition. COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects inflation to return to its 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3/4 to 1 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee decided to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities on June 1, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in conjunction with this statement. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic (more) For release at 2 p.m. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C. Williams. Vice Chair; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Esther L.

Chile,2022-05-05,"NPoretass dReel eparseen* sa Thursday, 5 May 2022. Monetary Policy Meeting  May 2022 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 125 basis points, to 8.25%. The decision was adopted with the unanimous vote of its members. World inflation has continued to rise, and central banks have intensified the withdrawal of their monetary stimuli. This has taken place in a scenario of still high commodity and food prices and confinements in China have put additional pressures on the recovery of global supply chains. The global growth outlook for this year has been adjusted downwards, approaching the values forecast in the March Monetary Policy Report. This, amid persistent uncertainty over the Russian invasion of Ukraine and signs of concern over activity in China. The movements of global financial markets have been driven mainly by risks associated with the speed at which the main central banks would withdraw their monetary stimulus measures, especially the United States Federal Reserve. In this context, since the last Meeting, long‐term interest rates rose in several economies, stock markets dropped and the dollar appreciated at the global level, all in an environment of higher financial volatility. The domestic financial market was partially affected by these developments. In the last month, the peso/dollar parity depreciated significantly, and long‐term interest rates (BTP‐10) increased. In turn, the IPSA declined while the sovereign risk premium (CDS) rose. In the credit market, lending performance continues to show moderate dynamism in the different portfolios. This outlook is consistent with the higher cost of credit, tighter access conditions and a more cautious attitude on the part of borrowers, as reflected in the qualitative information compiled in the May Business Perceptions Report (IPN). Based on published Imacec figures, economic activity would have grown 7.9% in the first quarter this year, a little above the last Monetary Policy Report's estimate, owing largely to the March result. On the demand side, short‐term indicators show that consumption remains resilient, while the investment weakens. In the latter, while capital imports remain high, most construction‐related indicators have continued to decline and survey data are revised downward for the 2022‐2025 period. In the labor market, the increase in employment has been slowing down since the end of last year, in a context where different indicators show a less dynamic demand while supply remains tight, albeit with some improvement. Consumer (IPEC) and business (IMCE) expectations have continued to deteriorate. March inflation was significantly higher than assumed in the last Monetary Policy Report, pushing the annual CPI variation to 9.4% (7.6% for core CPI, without volatiles). Worth noting was the rise in the prices of foods—core and volatile—, fuels, and some other specific items. Domestic inflationary pressures have been strengthened by the hikes in international energy and food prices, the exchange rate depreciation, and ongoing problems affecting global supply. Inflation expectations derived from the surveys—EES and FTS—remain above 3% in the two‐ year horizon. The recent evolution of inflation and its short‐term outlook exceed the forecast in the March Monetary Policy Report. This situation intensifies the risks of the inflation scenario, so the Board has determined to raise the MPR to around the upper bound of the policy rate corridor of the last MP Report. The next Monetary Policy Report will feature a new evaluation of the monetary policy trajectory. Nota de prensa The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be released at 8:30 hours of Friday, 20 May 2022. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will be held on Tuesday, 7 June 2022 and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours the same day. ___The Spanish original prevails.

Czech Republic,2022-05-05,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank increased the two-week repo rate to 5.75%, i.e. by 0.75 percentage point. At the same time, it increased the discount rate to 4.75% and the Lombard rate to 6.75%. Five members voted in favour of this decision and two members voted for leaving rates unchanged.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. Consistent with the baseline scenario of the spring forecast is a further sharp rise in market interest rates. In the baseline scenario, the central bank sets interest rates in order to achieve the 2% target at the standard monetary policy horizon. However, the Bank Board decided to tighten monetary policy more moderately. In the context of significant risks and uncertainties in both directions, it took into account, among other things, the message of a scenario featuring a more distant monetary policy horizon than the standard one used in the Czech National Bank's forecasting system. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has slowed the growth of the global economy, which will moreover face strong inflation pressures  driven mainly by a sharp rise in commodity prices  for longer. The outlook for economic growth in the effective euro area this year and the next has thus been revised down, due partly to longer-lasting supply chain disruptions. A jump in prices of most commodities and problems in global production chains have led to an increase in the outlook for producer prices, and to a lesser extent also consumer prices, especially for this year. The European Central Bank is expected to react by tightening its monetary policy this year and the next. The Brent crude oil price outlook has risen markedly, mainly because of the impact of the sanctions imposed on Russia, and is subject to exceptional uncertainty. The same applies to global gas prices. The expected euro-dollar exchange rate is slightly weaker, owing to a larger-than-expected impact of the war on Europe than on the USA and stronger tightening of US monetary policy. GDP growth will slow considerably this year, with economic activity even contracting slightly year on year in the second half of the year. This will be due largely to falling household consumption. Households' real income will decline this year, owing to rapid growth in living costs, and their sentiment has simultaneously worsened. Firms will rein in investment because of subdued domestic and external demand and a deterioration in their financial situation as a result of surging prices of energy and other commodities and materials. Growth in external demand is being adversely affected by the war in Ukraine, which, moreover, is exacerbating the problems in global value chains. Exports will thus remain subdued this year and firms will be forced to make increased additions to inventories until mid-2023. However, the contribution of net exports to economic growth will be slightly positive this year due to a noticeable cooling of domestic demand. GDP growth will recover next year. Headline inflation will rise further in the next few months, reaching almost 15% in late spring and early summer, with all its components contributing to the increase. Core inflation will continue to reflect both strong producer price inflation abroad and fading substantial domestic cost and demand pressures. Rising commodity prices will lead to a further marked increase in administered price inflation and growth in food prices. The strong cost pressures peaked at the start of this year, driven by both growing import prices and the overheating domestic economy and labour market. The fading of the above factors will cause the cost pressures to diminish already this year. Next year, a halt in growth and subsequent slight decrease in import prices will act in the same direction. This year's double-digit inflation will thus fall quickly in the first half of next year and return close to the 2% target in late 2023. The previous rapid increase in domestic interest rates will also contribute substantially to the drop. Consistent with the baseline scenario of the spring forecast is a further sharp rise in market interest rates until mid-2022, followed by a gradual decline from autumn 2022. In the baseline scenario, the central bank sets interest rates in order to achieve the 2% target at the standard monetary policy horizon of 1218 months, i.e. in 2023 Q2 and Q3. The forecasted rise in rates thus arises from an unreserved response to a combination of exceptionally strong price pressures from abroad and persisting domestic inflation pressures, reflected in accelerating and broad-based price growth. The monetary policy tightening will support the desired cooling of domestic demand pressures and reduce the transmission of imported inflation to domestic prices. Together with an easing of the current extreme foreign price pressures, this will lead to inflation falling close to the target in the second half of 2023. Interest rates in the forecast thus start decreasing gradually in the autumn. The koruna-euro exchange rate will firm to CZK 24 to the euro in Q2 as a result of a widening of the interest rate differential vis-à-vis the euro area. According to the forecast, the koruna exchange rate will fluctuate in a wider range just above this level next year. Stronger appreciation of the koruna will be prevented by still fevered sentiment on global financial markets related to the war in Ukraine and continuing difficulties in international trade, which, coupled with high commodity prices, will be reflected in a sizeable Czech current account deficit. This will be joined by a tightening of the European Central Bank's monetary policy amid a gradual decline in domestic interest rates at the end of this year. The CNB is increasing the trade volumes in its sales of income on international reserves in order to restrict growth in its balance sheet. By comparison with the winter forecast, the inflation outlook is significantly higher, especially for this year. By contrast, expected economic growth this year is markedly lower than in the previous forecast and will remain below 1% for this year as a whole. Conversely, the forecast for next year has been revised towards faster economic growth. Domestic interest rates are noticeably higher this year and the next by comparison with the winter forecast. The koruna-euro exchange rate is weaker next year. The Bank Board assessed the uncertainties and risks of the baseline scenario of the spring forecast as being significant and going in both directions. The upside risks include higher-than-forecasted energy and commodity prices, a threat of inflation expectations becoming unanchored from the CNB's 2% target and a related risk of higher growth in prices and wages in the medium term. Stronger-than-forecasted negative demand impacts of the war in Ukraine are a downside risk to inflation. The uncertainties include the future course of the war in Ukraine, the future monetary policy stance abroad and the duration of the disruptions to global value chains. In the context of the high inflation, which is currently having a significant adverse effect on firms' performance and households' purchasing power, the Bank Board considers it relevant to take into account the fact that this is largely due to strong external price shocks outside the control of domestic monetary policy. Therefore, a simulation featuring a more distant monetary policy horizon was prepared in addition to the baseline scenario. In this simulation, the central bank abstracts from inflation, which is being directly affected by strong exogenous price shocks that will manifest themselves in inflation at a horizon of 1218 months. Importantly, the simulation  like the baseline scenario  assumes that inflation expectations remain anchored to the 2% target, thus helping inflation return close to it. In the scenario featuring a more distant monetary policy horizon, the market interest rate path is lower than in the baseline scenario, especially this year. The rates increase to almost 6%. The exchange rate of the koruna is weaker than in the baseline scenario, due to a substantially narrower interest rate differential. The lower interest rates and weaker exchange rate lead to higher inflation. Even in this simulation, however, inflation falls to single figures next year, although the return to the 2% target is delayed until 2024."
Poland,2022-05-05,"Warsaw, 5 May 2022 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 5 May 2022 The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.75 percentage points, i.e. to 5.25%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: ▪ lombard rate at 5.75%; ▪ deposit rate at 4.75%; ▪ rediscount rate at 5.30%; ▪ discount rate at 5.35%. In 2022 Q1, conditions in the global economy remained relatively favourable although the activity growth slowed down in some economies. Prolonged disruptions in international trade and high commodity prices had a negative impact on the global economic situation. Russian military aggression against Ukraine contributed to an intensification of these factors and to a substantial rise in uncertainty surrounding further global macroeconomic developments as well as led to a deterioration in economic sentiment. Consequently, in the recent months GDP growth forecasts for some economies have been revised downwards. Many economies continue to see a surge in inflation, which reached the highest levels in decades. High commodity prices as well as prolonged disruptions in global supply chains and international transport remain the main source of growing inflation. In some economies, rising prices are also driven by growing labour costs. As a consequence, core inflation is also increasing. At the same time, inflation forecasts for the coming quarters are being significantly revised upwards. Amidst a strong increase in inflation, many central banks are tightening their monetary policy. The US Federal Reserve concluded net asset purchases and increases interest rates. The ECB keeps negative interest rates, although it has been reducing the scale of asset purchases. At the same time, central banks in the Central-Eastern Europe region continue to increase interest rates. Following the strong GDP growth in 2021 Q4, available data point to continuing high economic activity growth in 2022 Q1. In March, despite the weakening in sentiment of 1/3 economic entities due to the Russian military aggression against Ukraine, the growth of retail sales, industrial production as well as construction and assembly output remained high. Meanwhile, employment continues to increase accompanied by a marked rise in wages. A continuation of favourable economic conditions may be expected in the coming quarters, although a gradual slowdown of economic growth is forecast, while both the domestic and global outlook is subject to significant uncertainty stemming from the impact of Russian military aggression against Ukraine. Inflation in Poland  according to Statistics Poland flash estimate  increased in April 2022 to 12.3% which was mainly driven by a strong growth in the food prices due to a rise in global agricultural commodity prices amid Russian military aggression against Ukraine. High global energy commodity prices as well as earlier increases in regulated tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy have continued to contribute to markedly elevated inflation. At the same time, the ongoing economic recovery, including an increase in demand driven by rising household incomes, has had also a positive contribution to the price growth. In turn, a curbing impact on inflation has been exerted by a reduction in some tax rates as part of the Anti-inflationary Shield. In the coming quarters, inflation will remain markedly elevated due to a further impact of the factors currently amplifying price growth, including those related to the Russian military aggression against Ukraine. In the coming years, together with fading of the impact of shocks currently boosting prices, inflation will decrease. The decrease in inflation should also be supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council's assessment, will be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy. The Council assessed, that there persists a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. In order to reduce this risk, i.e. striving to decrease inflation to the NBP target in the medium term, the Council decided to increase NBP interest rates again. The increase of the NBP interest rates will also curb inflation expectations. Further decisions of the Council will depend on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy. NBP will take all necessary actions in order to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability, including above all to reduce the risk of inflation remaining elevated. NBP may 2/3 intervene in the foreign exchange market, in particular to limit fluctuations of the zloty exchange rate that are inconsistent with the direction of monetary policy."
Romania,2022-05-10,"The Board of the National Bank of Romania, having convened for the meeting of 10 May 2022, decided:. The annual inflation rate surged again in March 2022, climbing to 10.15 percent from 8.53 percent in February, mainly following a stronger pick-up in processed food and fuel prices, under the impact of the sharp rise in agri-food commodity and crude oil prices, once with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of international sanctions. In 2022 Q1, the annual inflation rate thus recorded a further significant, higher-than-expected increase (from 8.19 percent in December 2021), with exogenous CPI components making however a far more modest contribution, given the capping schemes for households' energy bill. Against this background, the slower growth rates of electricity and natural gas prices in Q1 have largely offset the influences of the strong rises in fuel and VFE prices. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate followed a markedly faster-than-expected upward path in 2022 Q1, going up from 4.7 percent in December 2021 to 7.1 percent in March. The evolution of this component continues to reflect the effects of almost across-the-board surges in commodity prices, mainly agri-food prices, and of elevated energy and transport costs, alongside the influences of production chain bottlenecks, compounded domestically by high short-term inflation expectations, the resilience of demand in certain segments, as well as by the significant share of food items and imported goods in the CPI basket. Therefore, the fast increase in the annual inflation rate in 2022 Q1 continued to come from global supply-side shocks, heightened during this period by the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and the retaliatory sanctions, which sped up the strong upward path of inflation worldwide, including in a number of European countries. Thus, sharp rises in the annual inflation rate, core inflation included, were reported by many countries in Europe and by the USA, amid an unprecedented macroeconomic situation in recent decades. Average annual CPI inflation rate and average annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP  inflation indicator for EU Member States) went up to 6.5 percent and 5.6 percent respectively in March 2022, from 5.0 percent and 4.1 percent respectively in December 2021. The new statistical data reconfirm the fall by 0.1 percent in economic activity in 2021 Q4 against the previous quarter, on the back of the marked deterioration in the performance of agriculture, which caused excess aggregate demand to remain low during this period, in line with February expectations, inter alia as a result of the recent revision of statistical data on GDP developments in 2020 and 2021. Moreover, a deceleration in annual GDP dynamics was reconfirmed, i.e. to 2.4 percent in 2021 Q4 from 6.9 percent in the previous three months, on account of the notably slower pace of domestic absorption. Conversely, net exports made a lower negative contribution to GDP growth, as the annual dynamics of the import volume of goods and services declined faster than those of the export volume. Against this background, the annual increase in the negative trade balance decelerated considerably as against Q3, due also to the narrowing of the unfavourable differential between the change in import prices and that in export prices. However, the current account deficit widened in annual terms at a significantly faster pace, under the impact of the worsening of the secondary income balance, with its share of GDP climbing consequently to 7.0 percent in 2021 as a whole, from 5.0 percent in 2020. The latest statistical data and analyses point to a slight re-acceleration of economic growth in 2022 Q1, followed however by a quasi-standstill in Q2, under the impact of the war in Ukraine and the associated sanctions. GDP developments in Q1 imply nevertheless a slight slowdown in its annual dynamics during this period too, amid a further base effect, as also suggested by the high-frequency indicators. Thus, the quasi-steady annual growth rates of retail trade and of sales of motor vehicles and motorcycles in January-February were accompanied by a plunge in the annual dynamics of market services to households. However, the annual dynamics of industrial output saw a mild pick-up, thus re-entering positive territory, whereas the volume of construction works recorded a markedly faster growth in annual terms. Moreover, the somewhat stronger advance posted in January-February overall by the annual change in imports of goods and services as compared to that in exports reflected chiefly the unfavourable effect of developments in external prices. This led however to a significantly faster widening of trade deficit versus the same year-earlier period, but to a more modest rise in the current account deficit, given the improvement in the secondary income balance, including on account of inflows of EU funds to the current account. At the same time, the number of employees in the economy stayed on a slightly upward trend in the first two months of 2022, yet amid uneven developments across sectors, while the ILO unemployment rate remained flat at 5.7 percent in Q1, visibly above pre-pandemic values and significantly above the historical low recorded in August 2019. The labour shortage reported by companies posted however a faster rise, also in early Q2, while remaining considerably below its pre-pandemic peak. The hiring intentions for the near-term horizon increased in April, especially in trade and services  also probably owing to the lifting of mobility restrictions , but saw a more modest pick-up in industry, inter alia in the context of the effects and uncertainties generated by the warfare in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed. Looking at the financial market, the main interbank money market rates have continued to rise at a relatively fast pace in the recent period, prompted by the monetary policy rate hike in April, as well as amid the central bank's firm control over market liquidity and the expectations on a further increase in the key rate. In turn, yields on government securities extended or steepened their upward path, inter alia under the influence of a renewed deterioration of financial investor sentiment vis-à-vis markets in the region, given the war in Ukraine, but also the expectations on a relatively swifter interest rate rise by the Fed. At the same time, the average remuneration of new time deposits rose at a considerably faster tempo in March and during 2022 Q1 overall. At this juncture, the EUR/RON exchange rate remained relatively stable in April as well. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector saw its pick-up come to a halt in March, yet at a particularly high level, i.e. 15.7 percent (from 15.8 percent in February), amid the strong increase in lending, especially to non-financial corporations, and with a rising  albeit relatively modest  contribution from government programmes. The share of leu-denominated loans in credit to the private sector widened further, reaching 72.7 percent. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the May 2022 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The updated forecast shows a renewed considerable worsening of the outlook for inflation, as the projected path of its annual dynamics has seen an additional significant upward revision across the entire horizon, under the strong impact of global supply-side shocks, compounded and protracted by the war in Ukraine and by the sanctions imposed on Russia. Specifically, the annual inflation rate is expected to accelerate its growth in 2022 Q2 and decline only gradually in the next four quarters, but more steeply thereafter, due to sizeable base effects and amid aggregate demand surplus narrowing to almost zero. As a result, the inflation dynamics will probably climb considerably above the previously-forecasted levels and will fall to one-digit levels no sooner than 2023 H2, remaining above the variation band of the target at the end of the projection horizon. The determinants of the new inflation outlook are the much higher increases expected for processed food and fuel prices, as well as for natural gas and electricity prices. The inflationary impact of the latter will, however, be substantially cushioned until March 2023 by the capping schemes for households' energy bill, but will become strongly manifest afterwards, counterbalancing in part and temporarily the opposite influences from base effects and from probable corrections in energy commodity prices. Uncertainties are, nevertheless, associated with the presumed impact, but also the duration of energy price capping schemes extended until March 2023, while notable risks continue to come from developments in commodity prices, particularly of agri-food and energy, as well as from the worsening/persistence of bottlenecks in production and supply chains, amid the war in Ukraine and the associated sanctions. At the same time, the war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia also compound considerably the uncertainties and risks to the outlook for economic activity, hence to medium-term inflation developments, through the effects potentially exerted, via multiple channels, on consumer purchasing power and confidence, as well as on firms' activity, profits and investment plans, but also by affecting the European/global economy and the risk perception towards economies in the region, with an unfavourable impact on financing costs. A major source of uncertainties and risks also remains the absorption of EU funds, especially those under the Next Generation EU programme, which is conditional on fulfilling strict milestones and targets for implementing the approved projects. However, uncertainties and risks are also associated with the fiscal policy stance, given the requirement for further fiscal consolidation amid the excessive deficit procedure and the overall tightening trend of financing conditions, yet in a challenging economic and social environment domestically and globally, strongly marked by the war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed. Particularly relevant are also the ECB's and the Fed's prospective monetary policy stances, as well as the level and pace of increase of key rates by central banks in Czechia. Poland and Hungary. In the meeting held today, 10 May 2022, based on the currently available data and assessments, as well as in light of the extremely elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 3.75 percent per annum from 3.00 percent per annum as of 11 May 2022. Moreover, it decided to raise the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 4.75 percent per annum from 4.00 percent per annum and the deposit facility rate to 2.75 percent per annum from 2.00 percent per annum, as well as to maintain firm control over money market liquidity. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to keep the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to anchor inflation expectations over the medium term, as well as to foster saving through higher bank rates, so as to bring back the annual inflation rate in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat target on a lasting basis, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The NBR is closely monitoring developments in the domestic and international environment and is using the tools at its disposal to achieve the fundamental objective of price stability in the medium term. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 12 May 2022 at 11:00 a.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 20 May 2022 at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board will be held on 6 July 2022."
Georgia,2022-05-11,"11.05.2022 The National Bank of Georgia keeps its monetary policy rate unchanged at 11.0 percent On May 11, 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged. The monetary policy rate is 11.0 percent. Elevated inflation and inflationary risks remain a recent global challenge. While inflationary processes were envisaged to stabilize in 2022, the Russian war against Ukraine created new risks. In particular, the sanctions imposed on Russia due to its military actions, and supply-side disruptions have significantly increased prices of a number of product categories on international markets. Therefore, inflation increased significantly both in developed and developing economies. Global surge in prices was transmitted to Georgian market as well and, despite the slowdown compared to the beginning of the year, inflation in Georgia remains high (12.8 percent). Had the aforementioned shock not materialized, sharp deceleration in inflation would have been expected. It should be noted that against the backdrop of the military activities, external sector outlook is highly uncertain. At the same time, recent appreciation of lari supported the decrease in imported inflation. Moreover, while nominal wage growth rates have recently increased, total productivity is improving as well, meaning that at this stage there are no significant pressures on prices stemming from the labor market. According to the current forecast, other things equal inflation will remain high over the course of the year, however it will have a declining path as last year's one-off effects are phased-out and given that monetary policy remains tight. Despite monetary policy tightening though, credit activity remains strong, partly due to consumer loans on one hand and foreign currency loans on the other. In response the NBG will keep the remuneration of reserve requirements on funds borrowed in the US dollar at 0 percent, even as the Fed Funds Rate increases. If necessary, in order to reduce the growth in foreign currency (FX) loans, the NBG may also introduce additional measures, including an increase in the upper bound of FX reserve requirements (currently at 25 percent). At the same time, recent macroprudential measures are expected to support the slowdown of current high growth in consumer lending. As for the aggregate demand, according to a revised forecast, the economy is expected to grow by about 4.5 percent in 2022. However, it should be noted that given current events, forecast uncertainty is particularly high. In response to rising inflationary risks, the gradual increase in the monetary policy rate over the past year has led to tight monetary policy stance. Monetary policy will keep a tightening bias until the risks of rising inflation expectations are sufficiently mitigated. Foreign demand continued significant recovery in the first quarter of 2022. However risks in this direction remain high due to the war in Ukraine. According to the preliminary data, in January-March 2022, exports of goods have increased by 43 percent annually. In the same period, the revenues from international travel have increased approximately 7.4-fold year-on-year, although the decrease compared to the corresponding period of 2019 is still significant (32 percent). Goods imports have also increased against the background of activated domestic demand - by 36 percent annually in January- March 2022. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on June 22, 2022."
Malaysia,2022-05-11,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to increase the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 2.00 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly increased to 2.25 percent and 1.75 percent, respectively. The sustained reopening of the global economy and the improvement in labour market conditions continue to support the recovery of economic activity. These have partly cushioned the impact of the military conflict in Ukraine and the strict containment measures in China. Inflationary pressures have increased sharply due to a rise in commodity prices, strained supply chains and strong demand conditions, particularly in the US. Consequently, several central banks are expected to adjust their monetary policy settings at a faster pace to reduce inflationary pressures. The global growth outlook will continue to be affected by the developments surrounding the conflict in Ukraine. COVID-19, global supply chain conditions, commodity price shocks, and financial market volatility. For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators show that growth is on a firmer footing, driven by strengthening domestic demand amid sustained export growth. The labour market is further lifted by a lower unemployment rate, higher labour participation and better income prospects. The transition to endemicity on 1 April 2022 would strengthen economic activity, in line with further easing of restrictions and the reopening of international borders. Investment activity and prospects have also improved, underpinned by the realisation of multi-year projects and positive growth outlook. However, risks to growth remain, which include a weaker-than-expected global growth, further escalation of geopolitical conflicts, worsening supply chain disruptions, and adverse developments surrounding COVID-19. Headline inflation is projected to average between 2.2% - 3.2% in 2022. Given the improvement in economic activity amid lingering cost pressures, underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to trend higher to average between 2.0% - 3.0% in 2022. Nevertheless, upward pressure on prices would be partly contained by existing price controls and the continued spare capacity in the economy. The inflation outlook continues to be subject to global commodity price developments, arising mainly from the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and prolonged supply-related disruptions, as well as domestic policy measures on administered prices. Over the course of the COVID-19 crisis, the OPR was reduced by a cumulative 125 basis points to a historic low of 1.75% to provide support to the economy. The unprecedented conditions that necessitated such actions have since abated. With the domestic growth on a firmer footing, the MPC decided to begin reducing the degree of monetary accommodation. This will be done in a measured and gradual manner, ensuring that monetary policy remains accommodative to support a sustainable economic growth in an environment of price stability. Bank Negara Malaysia 11 May 2022."
Mexico,2022-05-12,"During the first quarter of the year, global economic activity grew at a lower-than-anticipated rate. World inflation continued increasing due to pressures originated by bottlenecks in production, by the recovery of demand, and the high levels of food and energy prices. This environment continues generating expectations of a faster withdrawal of monetary stimulus worldwide. Financial conditions tightened further, with an increase in interest rates and a stronger US dollar, in a context of higher risk aversion. In its latest monetary policy decision, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points and anticipated future adjustments. Also, it announced that the reduction of its balance sheet will begin in June. At the same time, a large number of central banks continued raising their reference rates. Among key global risks are those associated with the pandemic, inflationary pressures lasting longer, the intensification of geopolitical turmoil, and greater adjustments in monetary and financial conditions. In domestic financial markets, the peso remained relatively stable, while interest rates increased accordingly to global trends. Preliminary information suggests that economic activity rebounded during the first quarter of 2022. Nevertheless, an environment of uncertainty and ample slack conditions continues to prevail, although the latter narrowed compared to the previous quarter. In addition to the shocks that have affected inflation throughout the health emergency, now there are pressures associated with the geopolitical conflict and the strict lockdown measures recently imposed by China. Thus, in April headline and core inflation registered annual variations of 7.68% and 7.22%, respectively, their highest levels since January 2001, while their expectations for 2022 and 2023 increased significantly. Medium-term expectations for both of them were revised upwards, while those for longer terms have remained stable at levels above the target. In view of greater-than-anticipated pressures on inflation, forecasts for headline and core inflation were revised upwards up to the second and third quarter of 2023, respectively, although convergence to the 3% target in the first quarter of 2024 is maintained (see table). These projections are subject to risks. On the upside: persistence of core inflation at high levels; external inflationary pressures associated with the pandemic; greater pressures on agricultural and livestock product prices and in energy prices due to the ongoing geopolitical conflict; exchange rate depreciation; and cost-related pressures. On the downside: a decline in the intensity of the war conflict; a better functioning of supply chains; a greater-than-expected effect from the negative output gap; and a larger-than-anticipated effect from the Policy Program to Fight Inflation and High Prices. The balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon remains biased to the upside and continues deteriorating. 1 The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the risk of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and price formation becoming contaminated. It also considered the increasing challenges posed by the ongoing tightening of global monetary and financial conditions, the environment of significant uncertainty, and greater inflationary pressures associated with the geopolitical conflict and with the resurgence of COVID- 19 cases in China, as well as the possibility of inflation being affected by additional pressures. Based on these considerations, the Board decided by majority to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 7.0%. With this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon. For the next monetary policy decisions, the Board will monitor thoroughly inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations. The latter, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times with the trajectory needed to facilitate the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets. Given the growing complexity in the environment for inflation and its expectations, taking more forceful measures to attain the inflation target may be considered. Voting in favor of the decision were Victoria Rodríguez. Galia Borja. Gerardo Esquivel, and Jonathan Heath. Voting in favor of raising the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 75 basis points to 7.25% was Irene Espinosa. 1/ Forecast starting May 2022. 2/ Forecast starting March 2022.

Peru,2022-05-12,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT MAY 2022 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 5.0% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 50 bps to 5.0 percent, thus continuing to normalize its monetary policy stance. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation increased from 6.82 percent in March to 7.96 percent in April, above the target range, due to the upsurge of significant increases in international food and fuel prices. Year-on-year core inflation also rose from 3.46 percent in March to 3.81 percent in April, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The significant increase in international energy and food prices since the second half of last year, recently accentuated by international conflicts, has led to sharp increases in global inflation rates in magnitudes not seen in many years both in advanced and other economies in the region. Thus, inflation is expected to return to the target range between the second and the third quarter of next year. The downward path of year-on-year inflation would begin in next July, as transitory pressures (exchange rate and international fuel and grain prices) begin to recede, with the economic activity still below its potential level. One-year-ahead expected inflation increased from 4.39 percent to 4.62 percent, between March and April, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Indicators of expectations for economic activity deteriorated in April. Global economic activity is improving, although at a slower pace due to the persistent bottlenecks in the global supply of goods and services, the reversal of monetary stimulus in advanced economies, the confinement measures in China and international conflicts. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants, including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, with an aim to consider changes in the monetary stance so that inflation returns to the target range over the forecast horizon. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 3.25 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 5.50 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months that a financial institution carries out since March 11, 2022; and the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months. In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates based on the amount of the operations. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on June 9, 2022."
Philippines,2022-05-18,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to raise the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent, effective Friday, 20 May 2022. Accordingly, the interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were raised to 1.75 percent and 2.75 percent, respectively. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that the strong rebound in domestic economic activity and labor market conditions during the first quarter of 2022 provides scope for the BSP to continue rolling back its pandemic-induced interventions, consistent with its exit strategy from monetary accommodation. With the provisional advances to the National Government reduced from P540 billion in 2020 and 2021 to only P300 billion in January 2022, the National Government will fully settle these loans tomorrow, 20 May 2022, ahead of the maturity schedule of 11 June 2022. Moreover, given ample liquidity, a gradual recovery in credit activity, and stable financial market conditions, the Monetary Board has decided to reconfigure the BSP's government securities (GS) purchasing window from a crisis intervention measure into a regular liquidity facility under our interest rate corridor framework. As part of the BSP's standard monetary operations toolkit for injecting liquidity into the financial market, the recalibrated GS purchasing window shall enhance the BSP's ability to manage domestic liquidity conditions and ensure the sustainability of its balance sheet. In deciding to raise the policy interest rate, the Monetary Board noted that the latest baseline forecasts have further shifted higher since the previous monetary policy meeting in March, indicating that elevated inflation pressures could persist over the policy horizon. Average inflation is likely to breach the upper end of the 2-4 percent target range in 2022 at 4.6 percent, while the forecast for 2023 has edged closer to the upper end of the target band at 3.9 percent. The balance of risks to the inflation outlook now leans toward the upside for both 2022 and 2023, with upside pressures emanating from the potential impact of higher oil prices, including on transport fares, as well as the continued shortage in domestic pork and fish supply. Meanwhile, downside risks are linked mainly to the potential impact of a weaker-than-expected global economic recovery amid the lingering threat of COVID-19 infections, heightened geopolitical tensions, and a tightening of global financial conditions. The Monetary Board also observed the emergence of second-round effects, including the higher-than-expected adjustment in minimum wages in some regions. Inflation expectations have likewise risen, highlighting the risk posed by sustained pressures on future wage and price outcomes. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that a timely increase in the BSP's policy interest rate will help arrest further second-round effects and temper the buildup in inflation expectations. The Monetary Board likewise reiterates its support for the sustained implementation of non-monetary interventions to mitigate the impact of persistent supply-side factors on inflation, particularly food supply and prices. On balance, persistent inflationary pressures point to the need for prompt monetary action to anchor inflation expectations. As the economic recovery continues to gain traction, the BSP shall proceed with its plans for the continued gradual withdrawal of its extraordinary liquidity interventions and the start of the normalization of its monetary policy settings. Looking ahead, the pace and timing of further monetary policy actions by the BSP shall be guided by data outcomes, in keeping with the BSP's price and financial stability objectives."
Egypt,2022-05-19,"Press Release  May 19th, 2022 MPC decides to raise key policy rates by 200 basis points In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 200 basis points to 1125 percent, 1225 percent, and 1175 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also raised by 200 basis points to 1175 percen. Global economic activity has slowed down due to ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukrain. Trade sanctions imposed on Russia and corresponding supply-chain bottlenecks have elevated global commodity prices, such as international prices for oil and wheat, with the latter's global supply also impacted by adverse weather conditions and poor harvests in select region. Meanwhile global financial conditions have tightened, as major central banks have continued to both tighten policy rates and reduce asset purchase programs with the aim of containing increased inflationary concerns in their respective countrie. In addition, recently introduced COVID-19 lockdowns in China have raised concerns about exacerbating existing global supply-chain disruption. Prior to the Russo-Ukrainian war, domestic economic activity continued to expand in 2021 Q4, recording a preliminary year-on-year growth rate of 83 percent, the second highest real GDP growth rate since 2002 Q3. This was partially supported by the robust growth in tourism, construction and manufacturing, as well as a positive base effect emanating from the low growth rates in the same period in 2020, resulting from the COVID-19 containment measure. Recently most leading indicators for economic activity have started to gradually normalize, and are expected to continue this trend over the near term, as the strong positive base effect diminishe. Going forward, economic activity will continue to expand albeit at a slower-than previously projected pace, partially due to the unfavorable spillovers of international developments emanating from the Russo-Ukrainian wa. Regarding the labor market, the unemployment rate declined in 2022 Q1, registering 72 percen. The witnessed decline stemmed from the increase in employment figures which more than offset the increase in the labor forc. Annual headline urban inflation increased to 131 percent in April 2022, from 105 percent in March 2022, its highest level since May 201. In addition, annual core inflation, which excludes volatile food and regulated items, continued its upward trend to record 119 percent in April 2022, from 101 percent in March 2022, its highest level since April 201. This increase is attributed mainly to food items and further supported by non-food item. While both were affected by the depreciation in the Egyptian pound that occurred on the 21st of March 2022 and seasonal patterns, several other factors contributed to the increase in food prices; namely adverse weather conditions and high fertilizer prices that caused tomatoes prices to soa. In the meantime, the impact of the Russo-Ukrainian war on the prices of wheat, wheat derivatives, and other food commodities, in addition to the continued seasonal inflationary impact of Ramadan, and the occurrence of multiple holidays during April 2022, increased the prices of the rest of the core food product. Against this background, the MPC decided that raising policy rates is necessary to contain inflationary pressures which is consistent with achieving price stability over the medium ter. Monetary policy tools are utilized to anchor inflation expectations, contain demand-side pressures and second-round effects emanating from supply shocks that may lead to deviations from inflation target. Therefore in accommodation of the first-round effects of supply shocks, the elevated annual headline inflation rate will be temporarily tolerated relative to the CBE's pre-announced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4, before declining thereafte. Achieving low and stable inflation over the medium term is a prerequisite condition to achieve high and sustainable growth rates, as well as supporting real income. The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations, rather than of prevailing inflation rate. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to achieve its price stability mandate over the medium ter.

South Africa,2022-05-19,"PRESS STATEMENT 19 May 2022 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank In recent months, the Omicron variant has transmitted globally and a major war started in Europe. The economic costs of the corona virus generally continue to fall, as most economies remained open despite the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. China's response to the new covid-19 outbreak and the sustained invasion of Ukraine by Russia will however weigh heavily on global economic growth and contribute to higher inflation. The war has impaired the production and trade of a wide range of energy, food and other commodities and will continue to do so for some time. As a result of these factors, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reduced its global growth forecast for 2022 to 3.6%. The SARB's forecast for global growth in 2022 is revised down from the March meeting to 3.5% (from 3.7%), and for 2023 is lowered to MPC Statement 19 May 2022 Page 1. The SARB's forecast for global growth in 2022 is revised down from the March meeting to 3.5% (from 3.7%), and for 2023 is lowered to MPC Statement 19 May 2022 Page 1 2.7% (from 2.8%).1 The economy of the Euro Area is also expected to weaken significantly this year and next. For 2024, global growth remains unchanged at 2.7%.2 Dramatically higher oil, commodity and food prices, additional constraints to trade and finance, and rising debt costs, worsen economic conditions for most emerging and developing economies. Although policy settings in advanced economies remain broadly accommodative, policy normalization by major central banks and higher yields have tightened global financial conditions. Investor appetite for riskier assets is weaker and asset values in major markets have declined sharply. Economies that failed to take advantage of better global conditions or to reduce large macroeconomic imbalances remain vulnerable to currency depreciation and capital outflows. Last year saw the ongoing recovery of the South African economy from the pandemic, expanding by 4.9%. The economy is expected to grow by 1.7% in 2022, revised down from 2.0% at the time of the March meeting. This is due to a combination of short- term factors, including the flooding in Kwa-Zulu Natal and the continued electricity supply constraints. Growth in output in the first quarter of this year is expected to be 3.6%, stronger than the 3.2% expected at the time of the March meeting.3 The economy is forecast to expand by 1.9% in both 2023 and 2024.4 At these rates, growth remains well above a low rate of potential, impacted by loadshedding, 1 The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) April forecast for global growth in 2023 is 3.6% and 3.4% for 2024. 2 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. 3 The January forecast for first quarter growth was 2.1%, seasonally adjusted and annualised, revised up to 3.2% in March. 4 The growth forecast includes expected changes in the policy rate. MPC Statement 19 May 2022 Page 2 infrastructure and policy constraints.5 Investment by the government sector has weakened significantly in recent years and that of public corporations is forecast to be very modest. Household spending remains supportive, as a result of good growth in disposable income, rising asset prices, and low interest rates. Private investment has also proved to be more resilient than previously expected. Tourism, hospitality and construction should see stronger recoveries as the year progresses. Overall, and after revisions, the risks to the medium-term domestic growth outlook are assessed to be balanced. With potential growth and expected GDP growth revised somewhat lower for this year, the output gap is unchanged over the forecast period. The output gap is expected to turn positive after the third quarter of 2023. Although important commodity export prices such as for coal, iron ore, platinum, and rhodium generally decreased in the latter half of 2021, they surged higher with the war. Oil prices spiked to around US$130 per barrel in the early days of the conflict. While oil prices currently sit at about US$110 per barrel, we expect them to stay higher than we did in March and to average US$103 per barrel for 2022. US$90 per barrel in 2023 and US$85 per barrel in 2024.6 South Africa's export commodity price basket is forecast to rise by 9.5% for the year as a whole (up from 8.0%), keeping the terms of trade elevated, before gradually falling in 2023 and 2024. As a result of these export and import price developments, the 5 Potential growth for 2022 is 0.6% (down from 0.8%), 0.9% (from 0.8%) in 2023 and unchanged at 1.1% in 2024. 6 The Brent crude oil assumptions in March were US$103. US$80, and US$75, respectively. MPC Statement 19 May 2022 Page 3 current account surplus is expected to reach 2.1% of GDP this year, easing to 0.8% in 2023 and around 0.0% in 2024.7 Although fiscal risk has eased on the back of better tax revenue and reduced borrowing needs, financing conditions remain tight and the yield curve for rand- denominated bonds is steep. Ten-year bond yields increased to about 10.3% in late February, and have remained around that level. The commodity export price surge appreciated the value of the currency. The rand has since depreciated strongly from April due to the start of policy normalisation in major economies and the slowdown in China's economy. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R15.88 to the US dollar, compared with R15.41 at the time of the previous meeting.8 As the global economy rebounded from the pandemic, continued policy accommodation and supply shortages increased prices of many goods and commodities.9 These prices have been given fresh impetus from further transport delays, supply constraints and food export restrictions. Producer price increases have passed-through to wages and consumer prices in major economies. Our estimate for inflation in the G3 is revised higher to 6.3% in 2022 (from 5.6%) and down to 2.7% in 7 In March, the current account surplus for 2022 was expected to be about 3.0% of GDP, 1.6% in 2023 and 0.8% in 2024. 8 The rand has depreciated by about 7.4% to the US dollar since the March meeting. 9 World food prices continue to rise. The assumption used for the forecast for USD-denominated world food prices in 2022 is revised higher from 6.8% to 15.3%. MPC Statement 19 May 2022 Page 4 2023 (from 3.0%), before moderating to 2.0% in 2024 (from 2.3%).10 The IMF expects global inflation of 7.4% in 2022 and 4.8% in 2023.11 Oil prices are revised up further for this year, and fuel price inflation is higher at 31.2% (up from 26.1%). As a result of higher global food prices, local food price inflation is also revised up and is now expected to be 6.6% in 2022 (up from 6.1%), and 5.6% in 2023 (up from 5.1%). Food price inflation is forecast to ease to 4.2% in 2024 (down from 4.4%). The Bank's forecast of headline inflation for this year is revised higher to 5.9% (from 5.8%), primarily due to the higher food and fuel prices. While food prices will stay high, fuel price inflation should ease in 2023, helping headline inflation to fall to 5.0%, despite slightly higher core inflation. Headline inflation of 4.7% is now expected in 2024. Core inflation is forecast lower at 3.9% in 2022 (down from 4.2%) due to lower services price inflation. Our forecast for core inflation in 2023 and 2024 is slightly higher at 5.1% (from 5.0%), and 4.8% (from 4.7%), respectively. Core goods inflation is forecast higher throughout the horizon, while core services inflation is unchanged in 2023 and 2024. The risks to the inflation outlook are assessed to the upside. Global producer price and food price inflation continued to surprise higher in recent months and may do so 10 The G3 comprises the United States, the Eurozone, and Japan. The latest CPI inflation in the respective components sits at 8.3%, 7.5% and 1.2%. 11 The IMF expects advanced economy inflation of 5.7% and emerging market economy inflation of 8.7% in 2022. MPC Statement 19 May 2022 Page 5 again. Russia's war in the Ukraine is likely to persist for the rest of this year and may have significant further effects on global prices. Oil prices increased strongly from the start of the war and may rise more as stresses in energy markets intensify. Electricity and other administered prices continue to present short- and medium-term risks. Higher diesel and coal prices may result in upward revisions to our electricity price forecast for 2023. Given below-inflation assumptions for public sector wage growth and higher petrol and food price inflation, considerable risk attaches to a still moderate nominal wage forecast. Higher than expected inflation has pushed major central banks to accelerate the normalisation of global policy rates, tightening global financial conditions. On balance, and with some exceptions, capital flow and market volatility is expected to remain for emerging market assets and currencies. Alongside currency depreciation, other risks to the inflation outlook, such as elevated food and fuel prices, have been realised. Average surveyed expectations of future inflation have increased to 5.1% for 2022 (from 4.8%). Expectations for inflation based on market surveys have increased to 5.9%.12 Long-term inflation expectations derived from the break-even rates in the bond market have also increased.13 In the near-term, headline inflation has increased well above the mid-point of the inflation target band, and is forecast to breach the target range in the second quarter. Headline inflation then returns closer to the mid-point in the fourth quarter of 2024, 12 The (Q1) Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey expectations rose above the target midpoint to 5.1% (4.8%) for 2022 and 5.0% (4.7%) for 2023. 13 Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These now sit at 5.93% for the 5-year and 6.65% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year break-even inflation sits at 6.91%. MPC Statement 19 May 2022 Page 6 taking into account the policy rate trajectory indicated by the Bank's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM). Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 4.75% per year, with effect from the 20 of May 2022. Four members of the Committee preferred the announced increase and one member preferred a 25 basis point rise in the repo rate. The implied policy rate path of the QPM, given the inflation forecast, indicates gradual normalisation through to 2024. As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting in response to new data and risks. Economic and financial conditions are expected to remain more volatile for the foreseeable future. In this uncertain environment, policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. The MPC will seek to look through temporary price shocks and focus on potential second round effects and the risks of de-anchoring inflation expectations. Current repurchase rate levels reflect an accommodative policy stance through the forecast period, keeping financial conditions supportive of credit demand as the economy continues to recover.14 The Bank has ensured adequate liquidity in domestic markets and will continue to closely monitor funding markets for stress. Better anchored expectations of future inflation could support lower interest rates, and can be realised by achieving a prudent public debt level, increasing the supply of 14 The forecasted trajectory for the repurchase rate implies a rise in the inflation-adjusted repo rate from -1.5% for 2021 to -0.9% for 2022, 1.2% for 2023, and 2.0% in 2024. The real repurchase rate calculation here is based on the 1-quarter ahead inflation forecast and are annual average rates.

Israel,2022-05-23,"Economic activity in Israel is continuing at a high level. Indicators of economic activity continueto show levels close to potential, and the pandemic's effect on the economy has declined significantly. However, the war in Ukraine and the lockdowns in China are increasing inflationary pressure,and leading to a slowdown in the pace of global economic activity. Inflation in Israel is exceeding the upper bound of the target range, at 4 percent over the past 12 months. With that, it remains significantly lower than in most advanced economies. One-year inflation expectations are around the upper bound of the target range. Longer-term expectations remain anchored within the target range. Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel has weakened by 4.6 percent against the US dollar, by 1.4 percent against the euro, and by 3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Economic data continue to indicate strong activity, even though first quarter GDP contracted by 1.6 percent in annual terms relative to the fourth quarter of 2021. This followed a 15.6 percent jump in the previous quarter. The labor market remains tight and close to the full employment that characterized the economy prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Businesses in most industries continue to indicate a shortage of workers as a constraint on their current operations. The upward trend in home prices continued to accelerate, with prices rising by 16.3 percent in the past 12 months. The Israeli economy is recording strong growth, accompanied by a tight labor market and a continued increase in the inflation environment. The Committee has therefore decided to continue the gradual process of increasing the interest rate. The pace of raising the interest rate will be determined in accordance with activity data and the development of inflation, in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy goals. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, click here. Economic activity in Israel is continuing at a high level, and the risk to the domestic economy from the continuing morbidity cycles seems to be fading, at least in the short term. Withthat, there is concern that global developments, particularly the war in Ukraine and the slowdown in activity in China as a result of the lockdowns, may have some negative impact on economic activity. Since the previous interest rate decision, the CPI increased by 0.6 percent in March and 0.8 percent in April. Inflation in Israel is above the upper bound of the target range, and was 4 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 1). However, it remains significantly lower than in most advanced economies (Figure 27). Net ofenergy and fruits and vegetables, inflation is 3.4 percent, and with the further neutralization of the effects of taxation and regulation, it is 3.1 percent (Figure 2). All of the primary components of the Index contributed to the increase in inflation in the past year, and the annual pace of inflation in both the nontradable and the tradable components continued to increase (Figure 3). Inflation expectations for the coming year from the various sources are around the upper bound of the target range (Figure 4). Since the previous policy decision, expectations derived from the capital market for all ranges declined slightly. Longer-term expectations remain anchored within the target range (Figure 5). Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel has weakened by 4.6 percent against the US dollar, by 1.4 percent against the euro, and by 3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate (Figure 6). Indicators of economic activity continue to show levels close to potential, and the pandemic's effect on the economy has declined significantly. According to the first estimate of National Accounts data for the first quarter of 2022. GDP contracted by 1.6 percent in annual terms relative to the fourth quarter of 2021, following a 15.6 percent jump in the fourth quarter (Figure 11). The decline in GDP in the first quarter was mainly influenced by declines in services exports (excluding the sale of startup companies), public consumption, and investments in the principal industries (Figure 12). However, a comparison of first quarter data from 2022 with first quarter data from 2021 indicates growth of about 9 percent. The level of GDP remains around the prepandemic trend line. The aggregate balance of the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey for April increased, continuing to reflect businesses' positive assessments of their situation (Figure 13). In view of the continuing global production and supply chain difficulties, the magnitude of the equipment and raw materials constraint reported by companies continued to increase, with a prominent increase in the manufacturing and construction industries. Total credit card purchases remained high, with a marked recovery in the tourism, leisure, transportation, and restaurant industries. Direct and indirect tax receipts continued to increase rapidly. Goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds) remain higher than before the pandemic, and services exports remain high (Figure 15). Goods imports are also high in all components (Figure 16). The labor market remains tight and close to the full employment that characterized the economy prior to the pandemic. In April, the adjusted employment rate (aged 15+) declined slightly, to 60.1 percent: slightly lower than the average employment rate in 2019 (61.1 percent). The gap is equal to about 70,000 employees (Figure 22). While the narrow unemployment rate declined in April to a low of 3.1 percent from its March average of 3.4 percent (Figure 18), the decline was due to a decline in labor force participation and not an increase in employment. The number of job vacancies continued to increase in April, and remains high. So far, the overall pace of wage increases according to the composition-adjusted index is close to its prepandemic trend (Figure 20). However, wages in the business sector are slightly higher than the path that corresponds to the prepandemic trend, while wages in the public sector are increasing more moderately. The upward trend in home prices continued to accelerate, with prices rising by 16.3 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 9), a significantly higher pace than in previous years. The volume of new mortgages taken out in April was lower than in March, at NIS 10.5 billion. However, after adjusting for seasonal factors in April, there was no significant change in the high pace of new mortgages (Figure 10). Alongside this, the annual increase in rents (in renewing contracts) was 3.2 percent. In the domestic capital market there were declines in the equity indices and government bond yields increased significantly, similar to the global trend (Figure 7). Corporate bond spreads continued to increase, but remained at low levels by historical perspective. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, financing constraints among businesses remained relatively low <span dir 3DRTL>)Figure 17). Indicators of economic activity continue to show levels close to potential, and the pandemic's effect on the economy has declined significantly. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, financing constraints among businesses remained relatively low <span dir 3DRTL>). Globally, the war in Ukraine and its effects, as well as the slowdown in economic activity in China due to the increase in COVID-19 morbidity there and policy's response to it, are extending the interruptions in the global production chain, despite some decline in shipping prices. This is prolonging the energy crisis, increasing inflationary pressures, and leading to a slowdown in the pace of global economic activity. In view of this, investment houses have revised their global growth forecasts downward (Figure 23). The global purchasing managers' index declined slightly in April, mainly influenced by moderation originating in China, while the indices in the rest of the world continue to indicate expansion of economic expansion (Figure 24). There were sharp declines in the equity indices, with high volatility (Figure 31). Commodity markets were also volatile, with price increases in oil and agricultural commodities due to the war in Ukraine and the export restrictions imposed in India. In the bond markets, the increases in yields on government bonds continued, with a high level of volatility, in view of the increase in the inflation environment and uncertainty regardingthe future inflation and interest rate paths. Corporate bond spreads continue to widen. In most countries, the inflation indices are significantly higher than the central bank targets. Monetary tightening around the world therefore continues. In the US, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 50 basis points, and announced a shrinking of its balance sheet (QT). In the eurozone, the European Central Bank left its interest rate unchanged, confirmed its intention to end its government bond purchasing program in the coming months, and signaled an increase in its interest rate later on. In a number of other countries where inflation is above the central bank target, there were increases in the interest rates (Figure 28). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on June 6, 2022. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday.

Pakistan,2022-05-23,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement May 23, 2022. At today's meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the policy rate by 150 basis points to 13.75 percent. This action, together with much needed fiscal consolidation, should help moderate demand to more sustainable pace while keeping inflation expectations anchored and containing risks to external stability. Since the last MPC meeting, provisional estimates suggest that growth in FY22 has been much stronger than expected. Meanwhile external pressures remain elevated and the inflation outlook has deteriorated due to both home-grown and international factors. Domestically an expansionary fiscal stance this year, exacerbated by the recent energy subsidy package, has fueled demand and lingering policy uncertainty has compounded pressures on the exchange rate. Globally inflation has intensified due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and renewed supply disruptions caused by the new Covid wave in China. As result, almost all central banks across the world are suddenly confronting multi-year high inflation and challenging outlook. After contracting by. percent in FY20 in the wake of Covid, the economy has rebounded much more strongly than anticipated, growing by. percent last year and accelerating to.97 percent this year, as per provisional estimates. At 13. percent (y/y), headline inflation unexpectedly rose to two-year high in April and has now been in double digits for six consecutive months. Inflation momentum was also elevated, at. percent (m/m), and core inflation rose further to 10. and. percent in rural and urban areas, respectively. On the external front, notwithstanding some encouraging moderation in the current account deficit during April, the Rupee depreciated further due both to domestic uncertainty as well as recent strengthening of the US dollar in international markets following tightening by the Federal Reserve. The MPC's baseline outlook assumes continued engagement with the IMF, as well as reversal of fuel and electricity subsidies together with normalization of the petroleum development levy (PDL) and GST taxes on fuel during FY23. Under these assumptions, headline inflation is likely to increase temporarily and may remain elevated throughout the next fiscal year. Thereafter it is expected to fall to the 5-7 percent target range by the end of FY24, driven by fiscal consolidation, moderating growth, normalization of global commodity prices, and beneficial base effects. Considering the balance of risks around this baseline, the MPC felt it was important to take effective action to anchor inflation expectations and maintain external stability. In addition to today's policy rate increase, the interest rates on EFS and LTFF loans are also being raised. Going forward, to strengthen monetary policy transmission, these rates will be linked to the policy rate and will adjust automatically, while continuing to remain below the policy rate in order to incentivize exports. At the same time, the MPC emphasized the urgency of strong and equitable fiscal consolidation to complement today's monetary tightening actions. This would help alleviate pressures on inflation, market rates and the external account. Real sector. Unlike most emerging markets. Pakistan experienced relatively mild contraction after the Covid shock in 2020, followed by sustained and vigorous rebound. As result, output is now above its pre-pandemic Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN trend, such that tightening of macroeconomic policies that is necessitated by the presently elevated pressures on inflation and the current account is also warranted from the perspective of demand management. Most demand indicators have remained strong since the last MPC—including sales of POL and automobiles, electricity generation, and sales tax on services—and growth in LSM accelerated in March. Both consumer and business confidence have also ticked up. With the output gap now positive, the economy would benefit from some cooling. On the back of monetary tightening and assumed fiscal consolidation, growth is expected to moderate to.5-4. percent in FY23. External sector. The current account deficit continues to moderate. In April, it fell to $623 million, less than half the average for the current fiscal year, on the back of lower imports and record remittances. Based on PBS data, the trade deficit shrank by 24 percent relative to its peak last November. These developments are in line with SBP's projected current account deficit of around percent of GDP this year. Next year, the current account deficit is projected to narrow to around percent of GDP as import growth continues to slow with moderating demand and the recent measures taken by the government to curtail non-essential imports, while exports and remittances remain resilient. This narrowing of the current account deficit together with continued IMF support will ensure that Pakistan's external financing needs during FY23 are more than fully met, with an almost equal share coming from rollovers by bilateral official creditors, new lending from multilateral creditors, and combination of bond issuances. FDI and portfolio inflows. As result, excessive pressure on the Rupee should attenuate and SBP's FX reserves should resume their previous upward trajectory during the course of the next fiscal year. Fiscal sector. Instead of the budgeted consolidation, the fiscal stance in FY22 is now expected to be expansionary. At. percent of GDP, the primary deficit during the first three quarters of the year compares unfavorably with the primary surplus of. percent of GDP during the same period last year. This slippage was driven by sharp rise in non-interest expenditures, led by higher subsidies, grants and provincial development expenditures. The resulting demand pressures have coincided with the sharp rise in costs from the surge in global commodity prices, exacerbating inflationary pressures and the import bill. Timely action is needed to restore fiscal prudence, while providing adequate and targeted social protection to the most vulnerable. Such prudence enabled Pakistan's public debt to decline from 75 percent of GDP in FY19 to 71 percent in 2021 despite the Covid shock, in sharp contrast to the average increase of around 10 percent of GDP across emerging markets over the same period. Monetary and inflation outlook. In nominal terms, private sector credit growth remained robust through April, reflecting strong economic activity and higher input prices which have enhanced working capital requirements of firms. Since the last MPC meeting, secondary market yields, benchmark rates and cut-off rates in the government's auctions have risen, particularly at the short end. The MPC noted that the market rates should be aligned with the policy rate and in case of any misalignment after today's policy decision. SBP would take appropriate action. Headline inflation rose from 12. percent (y/y) in March to 13. percent in April, driven by perishable food items and core inflation. The rise in core inflation reflects strong domestic demand and second-round Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN effects of supply shocks. At the same time, measures of long-term inflation expectations have also ticked up. As electricity and fuel subsidies are reversed, inflation is likely to rise temporarily and may remain elevated through FY23 before declining sharply during FY24.

Nigeria,2022-05-24,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 142 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON MONDAY 23rd AND TUESDAY 24th May 2022 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 23rd and 24th of May 2022 confronted with declining global growth and heightened uncertainties associated with adverse price developments across the world. These developments partly reflect the aftermath of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the backlash from the numerous sanctions imposed on Russia by major Advanced Economies, as well as persisting supply chain disruptions in major trading routes. At the same time, the Chinese economy remained confronted with the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, total lockdown of major cities, significant distortions in the property market and modest inflationary pressures. Consequently Advanced Economy and Emerging Market Economy central banks alike, are switching to monetary tightening to curb the sharp rise in inflation globally. Even as global output growth recovery moderates, the domestic economy is expected to remain on the current path of recovery through 2022. This is hinged on the continued impact of stimulus by both the monetary and fiscal authorities to support the economy following the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee assessed these developments and the outlook for the rest of the year. Eleven (11) members of the Committee attended this meeting. Global Economic Developments Global output growth commenced a broad slowdown in the first quarter of 2022, as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, after recovering considerably in 2021. This led to massive supply constraints, with the backlash of sanctions against Russia creating huge macro-economic imbalances for several countries. Consequently the uncertainties that have arisen are buoyed by the resumption of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, a key hub of global manufacturing. This has given rise to upside risks to inflation and downside risks to growth. In addition, the huge amount of stimulus deployed by various countries to ease the downsides of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in 2021, has predisposed the global economy to huge debt levels, considering the current burgeoning global private and public debt portfolios. Central banks in both the Advanced and Emerging Market Economies have thus commenced monetary policy tightening to curb rising prices. This could impact the recovery negatively and result in a rise in debt default as global financial conditions tighten. Furthermore China has also re-introduced constraining measures to mitigate the spread of a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic within its major industrial cities, resulting in a slowdown in production. In light of these headwinds, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded its forecast for global output growth for 2022 and 2023 to 36 per cent apiece from 44 and 38 per cent, respectively, reflecting the severity of setbacks to the global recovery. Inflation continued to rise unabated across several Advanced Economies and is projected to remain high, at least in the medium term, as food and energy prices pushed higher to levels not previously recorded in four decades. This is due to tightening supply amidst closure of major trade routes that supply inputs for food and fertilizer, as well as the high price of energy. In the Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs), inflation also remained high due to a combination of persisting high food and energy prices; supply chain disruptions 2 associated with the impact of sanctions against Russia; exchange rate pressure; capital flow reversals; as well as underlying legacy constraints. In the global financial markets, investor confidence is gradually being restored, evidenced by portfolio rebalancing with the gradual decline in gold price. The demand for advanced economy equities and bonds has improved with the commencement of interest rate lift-off led by the US Fed and the Bank of England, resulting in the outflow of capital from emerging market securities. Global financial conditions are thus, expected to tighten in the near term, as risk-averse investors reassign substantial portions of their portfolios from perceived riskier, though more rewarding Emerging Market securities to less risky advanced economy securities. In general, the global economy and financial markets, are confronted with significant risks in the medium term as the huge build-up of both private and public debt may push several fragile economies into a new era of recession. Domestic Economic Developments According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 311 per cent in the first quarter of 2022, compared with 398 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 051 per cent in the corresponding period of 2021. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of real output expansion, following the economy's exit from recession in 2020. This steady positive performance, was driven largely by the growth in aggregate consumption, arising from the continued policy support at the onset of the pandemic and gradual recovery of aggregate demand. Headline inflation (year-on-year) ticked up to 1682 per cent in April 2022 from 1592 per cent in March 2022, 90 basis points increase. This is the third consecutive increase in inflation since the commencement of the year 2022, attributable to the rise in both the core and food components to 1418 and 1837 per cent in April 2022 from 1391 and 1720 per cent in March 2022, respectively. The rise in headline inflation resulted from rising energy prices 3 associated with the epileptic supply of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), high cost of Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), mostly used in transportation and production as well as a progressive hike in electricity tariffs. The increase in the food component was driven by shocks to food prices associated with persisting security challenges in major food-producing areas and legacy infrastructural problems which continue to hamper food supply logistics and storage across the country. Broad money supply (M3) rose significantly to 622 per cent in April 2022, compared with 419 per cent in March 2022. This was largely driven by strong growth in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of 1186 per cent in April 2022, compared with 882 per cent in the previous month. The growth in NDA was attributed to the increase in claims on the Federal Government and other sectors (public non-financial corporations, private sector, and state and local governments). Money market rates oscillated within and outside the Standing Facilities Corridor (SFC), reflecting the prevailing liquidity conditions in the banking system. Consequently the monthly weighted average Open Buyback (OBB) and Inter- bank Call rates increased to 749 and 867 per cent in April 2022, from 662 and 450 per cent in March 2022, respectively. The increase in rates was an indication of the tight liquidity conditions in the banking system during the review period. The performance of the equities market remained strong and positive in the review period, with the All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalization (MC) increasing significantly from 46,,96548 and N2531 trillion on March 31, 2022, to 52,,97948 and N2856 trillion on May 20, 2022, respectively. In the Banking System, the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and the Liquidity Ratio (LR) remained above their prudential limits at 146 and 437 per cent, respectively. The Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio stood at 53 per cent in April 2022, compared with its prudential limit of 50 per cent, reflecting sustained stability in the banking system, though there remains a need to bring this down to the prudential limit. Gross external reserves declined moderately to US$3836 billion as at May 19th, 2022 from US$3928 billion at end-March 2022. This was attributed to the weak accretion to the reserves from exports and the high cost of importation of refined petroleum products. The Committee reviewed the performance of the Bank's intervention schemes targeted at stimulating productivity in agriculture; manufacturing/industries; energy/infrastructure; healthcare; exports; and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Between April and May 2022, the Bank released the sum of N5791 billion under the Anchor Borrowers' Programme (ABP) to 185,,972 new projects for the cultivation of rice, wheat, and maize, bringing the cumulative disbursement under the Programme to N101 trillion, disbursed to over 42 million smallholder farmers cultivating 21 commodities across the country. The Bank further disbursed the sum of N150 billion, under the Accelerated Agriculture Development Scheme (AADS), to one new youth-led project, piloted and funded through the Government of Ondo State for the acquisition of assets for oil-palm cultivation and the establishment of poultry farms. This brings the total disbursement under the Scheme to N2123 billion for 10 state-led and three private sector-led projects. In addition, the Bank released N2173 billion to finance seven large-scale agricultural projects under the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme (CACS). The funds were utilized for the establishment of a ranch and milk processing facility; procurement of feed and medication for livestock/dairy production; construction of a 300 metric-tonne per day oil mill in Gusau. Zamfara State; acquisition and installation of an agrochemical factory; as well as purchase and stockpiling of homegrown maize for animal feed production. This brings the cumulative disbursement under this Scheme to N74105 billion for 674 projects in agro-production and agro-processing. Under the Paddy Aggregation Scheme (PAS). N620 billion was disbursed by the Bank to three new projects for the purchase and mopping-up of home-grown rice paddy. This brings the total funds disbursed to 42 integrated rice millers under the PAS to N10639 billion. To support the growth of the manufacturing sector, the Bank disbursed the sum of N43685 billion to 34 new projects under the N10 trillion Real Sector Support Facility (RSSF). This was utilized for both greenfield (new) and brownfield (expansion) projects under the COVID-19 Intervention for the Manufacturing Sector (CIMS) and the Real Sector Support Facility from Differentiated Cash Reserve Requirement (RSSF-DCRR). Cumulative disbursement under the RSSF for the financing of 402 real sector projects across the country, currently stands at N210 trillion. The Bank disbursed N5534 billion, under the 100 for 100 Policy on Production and Productivity (100 for100 PPP), to 44 projects, comprising 24 in manufacturing, 17 in agriculture, 2 in healthcare, and 1 in the services sector. In the healthcare sector, the Bank disbursed N1770 billion to four healthcare projects under the Healthcare Sector Intervention Facility (HSIF), bringing the cumulative disbursements to N13049 billion for 126 projects, comprising 58 hospitals, 31 pharmaceuticals and 37 other healthcare services. The Bank released the sum of N2100 billion Under the Export Facilitation Initiative (EFI), for three projects in domestic production and value addition of cocoa and sesame seed. This intervention is targeted at further expansion of the economy's non-oil export basket towards improving foreign exchange revenue earnings for the country. To support micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), the Bank disbursed N150 billion to 2,,718 new projects through the Agri-Business Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AgSMEIS) for activities in fish farming, rice processing, wheat farming, poultry farming, livestock farming. ICT and tailoring amongst others. This brings the cumulative disbursements under AgSMEIS to N13613 billion. Under the Micro. Small, and Medium Enterprises Development Fund (MSMEDF), the Bank disbursed N279 billion to support youths engaged at various nodes of the agricultural value chain, bringing the total disbursement under this intervention to N9888 billion to 749 MSME projects across the country. In energy/infrastructure, the Bank released N1571 billion to power sector players including generation companies (GenCos) and gas companies (GasCos), under the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Plc – Payment Assurance Facility (NBET- PAF), bringing the cumulative disbursement under the facility to N130 trillion. The sum of N2267 billion was also released to Distribution Companies (DisCos) for their Operational Expenditure (OpEx) and Capital Expenditure (CapEx), under the Nigeria Electricity Market Stabilisation Facility – Phase 2 (NEMSF-2). Cumulative disbursement under the NEMSF-2 currently stands at N25193 billion. Additionally under the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP), the Bank has disbursed N019 billion to DisCos for the procurement of electricity meters, bringing the cumulative disbursement for the procurement and installation of 865,,956 meters across the country to N4782 billion. Interventions in energy/infrastructure are designed to improve investment and develop enabling infrastructure in the Nigeria Electricity Supply Industry. Outlook The broad outlook for both the global and domestic economies in the medium- term, remains clouded with uncertainties arising from the lingering war between 7 Russia and Ukraine, the unfolding impact of the extensive sanctions imposed by several countries on Russia, and the downside risks from the continued spread of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Global growth is thus confronted with significant headwinds which may derail the current projection further. The persisting rise in inflation, is also set to undermine the recovery of output growth, due to the associated build-up of uncertainties around the cost of inventory and other production inputs. The rise in global debt is also an unfolding dilemma which policy makers must carefully evaluate and address to avert a near-term global financial crisis. In summary, while global aggregate demand remains strong and growing, the numerous supply-side constraints will continue to undermine the recovery effort, at least in the short to medium term. In the domestic economy, data on key macroeconomic variables indicate that the recovery of output growth will continue, probably at a more subdued pace, considering the unfolding domestic and external shocks to the economy. Domestic price development is, however, expected to maintain an upward pressure in the light of the build-up of increased spending related to the 2023 general elections. Consequently the Nigerian economy is expected to grow, in line with CBN forecast of 324 per cent in 2022. However the FGN forecast is at 420 per cent, while the IMF projects Nigeria's growth in 2022 to be 340 per cent. The Committee's Considerations At this meeting, the MPC noted the risks confronting the global economy, as those associated with, not only inflation and prices, but also include risks associated with weakening growth prospects across the world. The Committee observed that whereas post-pandemic policy support has remained broadly expansionary, at least, from a fiscal standpoint, the sharp rise 8 in inflation across both the Advance & Emerging Markets Economies has generated growing concern amongst central banks, as the progressive rise in inflation, driven by rising aggregate demand and wage growth, is putting unsustainable upward pressure on price levels. Consequently major central banks such as the US Fed. Bank of England. European Central Bank, and Bank of Canada have provided strong guidance for a progressive shift away from monetary policy accommodation to drive market interest rate upward, which may ultimately impact capital flow away from Emerging Market Economies. On another hand. MPC noted that the war between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in significant disruption of the global supply chain, at a time when the global economy is still confronted with downside risks to growth associated with the Covid 19 pandemic. In addition to this, global trade has been impacted by the series of restrictions imposed by NATO countries and its allies against trade with Russia. This has increasingly fragmented the global economy, imposing huge strains on the tepid post-pandemic recovery. Only recently. China, the USA, and South Africa are seeing a renewed spike in COVID-19 infections. As a result, the Chinese government recently re-introduced lockdown in major industrial cities, to forestall the spread of the pandemic: further disrupting the supply chain crisis. In the view of the MPC, these two risks pose great challenges to rising inflation globally. For the domestic economy, the MPC noted with delight that the GDP grew by 311 percent in Q1, 2022 (y-o-y), highlighting a steady recovery for the 6th consecutive quarter. Quarter on quarter real GDP grew by 936 percent, a slight moderation from 1107 percent in the previous quarter. The MPC however was concerned about the somewhat aggressive rise in inflation by almost 90 basis points in April, 2022. To dampen the expectation of the inflationary pressure. MPC decided on the need to take a shift from its historically cautious approach on interest rate, to a policy rate hike, while still adopting an accommodative approach to development finance initiatives that have supported the growth of the economy and sustained recovery. The MPC is of the view that rates on 9 the development finance initiatives of the Bank should remain at 5 percent till March, 2023. Consequently as regards the decision on whether to hold. tighten or loosen. MPC feels that loosening in the face of the rising policy rates in Advance economies may result in a sharp rise in capital outflow and faster dry-up of foreign credit lines. MPC also feels that loosening could lead to further liquidity surfeit and inflationary pressure. to whether to hold. MPC feels its stance would strengthen the perception that the CBN has abandoned its primary mandate of taming inflation. On the need to tighten. MPC feels that tightening would help moderate the inflationary trade-off from the steady growth recovery so far. MPC also feels that tightening would help rein in inflation before it assumes a galloping trend, considering the progressive increase in headline inflation (m-o-m), particularly with the sharp 90 basis point increase in April, 2022. Furthermore MPC feels that tightening would narrow the negative real interest rate margin, improve market sentiment and restore investor confidence. Equally members believe tightening would moderate inflationary pressure pass-through to exchange rate depreciation and moderate the speed of capital flow reversal, provide incentives for foreign capital inflows and sustain remittances. Lastly tightening could moderate government domestic borrowing, as government debt servicing to revenue ratio increased significantly in recent times, threatening debt sustainability. The Committee's Decision Members expressed deep concern about the continued uptrend of inflationary pressure. Despite the gradual improvement in output growth. The Committee noted that the current rise in inflation may be inimical to growth, and thus hinder the full recovery of the economy. While the MPC identified several supply-side factors which may be contributing to inflationary pressure, emerging evidence shows that money demand pressure is on the rise and is unlikely to abate until 10 the 2023 general elections are concluded. The dilemma confronting the Committee at this meeting, therefore, is how best to drive down domestic prices while continuing to support the fragile recovery. In the current circumstance, the Committee was of the view that it was confronted with the choice of either to hold all policy parameters constant to allow previous policy measures to continue to support growth or tighten the stance of policy to curb money demand growth and upward movement of domestic prices. loosening option would likely result in an increased liquidity surfeit, rise in inflationary pressure, and further pressure on the exchange rate. The choice of holding, in the view of Members, would not only continue to support growth, even though moderately, but will also allow the growth of money demand to continue at the current pace, leading to the uptick in inflationary pressure. While growth concerns remain paramount to the Committee, the persistent uptick in domestic price levels is clearly a downside risk to growth, that must be addressed urgently. While it may seem contradictory to raise rates in the face of fragile growth, this is the dilemma that most Central banks around the world are grappling with at the moment. Yet on balance, it is quite clear and compelling that tackling inflation is more urgent in the sequence of policy objectives. In this regard, the MPC urged the Bank to redouble its efforts at supporting the priority growth- enhancing sectors of the economy while urging the Federal government to do more to provide a safe and secure environment for economic agents to boost activities and growth. After carefully reviewing the developments of the last two months and the outlook for both the domestic and global economies, as well as the benefits and downsides of each policy option, the Committee decided to raise the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to rein in the current rise in inflation as Members were of the view that the continued uptrend would adversely affect growth. The Bank further reaffirmed its commitment to continue to provide support to 11 priority sectors as the need arises to support growth until the current upward pressure in price development abates. The Committee thus decided by unanimous vote to raise the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR). Six members voted to raise the MPR by 150 basis points, four members by 100 basis points, and One member by 50 basis points. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Raise the MPR to 130 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 275 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 24th May, 2022 12."
South Korea,2022-05-26,"The bank of korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.50% to 1.75%. Currently available information suggests that inflationary pressures have remained high, while the recovery of the global economy has moderated affected by the Ukraine crisis and lockdown measures in China. In global financial markets, government bond yields in major countries have risen and the US dollar has strengthened considerably, due to expectations about a faster pace of the US Federal Reserve's policy normalization. Stock prices have fallen sharply as risk aversion has strengthened. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by global inflation movements, monetary policy changes in major countries, geopolitical risks, and COVID-19 restrictions in major countries. The Korean economy has continued to recover. Private consumption has improved rapidly supported by the lifting of social distancing restrictions, while facilities investment has continued to slow due to global supply constraints and exports have moderated. Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed remaining high. Going forward, the economy is likely to sustain its recovery supported by the improvement in private consumption, despite slower export growth owing to moderation in global economic growth. GDP growth this year is projected to be at the upper-2% level, somewhat below the February forecast of 3.0%. Consumer price inflation has risen significantly to the upper-4% level due to the accelerating increase in the prices of petroleum products and industrial products, the ongoing sharp rise in the prices of personal services, and increases in electricity and gas fees. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) and the inflation expectations of the general public have increased to the lower-3% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain high in the 5% range for some time, and run at the mid-4% level for the year overall, substantially above the February forecast of 3.1%. Core inflation is forecast to rise to the lower-3% level for the year overall. In domestic financial markets, the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has risen significantly and stock prices have fallen while long-term market interest rates have fluctuated considerably, mainly driven by acceleration of the US Federal Reserve's policy rate hikes as well as concerns over slowing economic growth in China. Household loans have shifted to a slight increase and housing prices have remained steady. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board sees it as warranted to conduct monetary policy with more emphasis on inflation for some time, as the Korean economy is expected to continue its recovery and inflation to run above the target level for a considerable time, despite underlying uncertainties in domestic and external conditions. In this process the Board will judge when to further adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing the trends of growth and inflation, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, monetary policy changes in major countries, and external economic conditions including geopolitical risks."
Russia,2022-05-26,"The Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 300 basis points to 11.00% per annum effective from 27 May 2022. The latest weekly data point to a significant slowdown in the current price growth rates. Inflationary pressure eases on the back of the ruble exchange rate dynamics as well as the noticeable decline in inflation expectations of households and businesses. In April annual inflation reached 17.8%, however, based on the estimate as of 20 May, it slowed down to 17.5%, decreasing faster than in the Bank of Russia's April forecast. Funds continue to flow into fixed-term ruble deposits while lending activity remains weak. This limits proinflationary risks and makes it necessary to ease monetary conditions. External conditions for the Russian economy are still challenging, considerably constraining economic activity. Financial stability risks decreased somewhat, enabling a relaxation of some capital control measures. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets, and holds open the prospect of key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will decrease to 5.07.0% in 2023 and return to 4% in 2024. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 10 June 2022. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Turkiye,2022-05-26,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 14 percent. The escalation of ongoing geopolitical risks keeps the downside risks to regional and global economic activity alive and increase the uncertainty. Increasing concern over global food security driven by trade restrictions, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors that have become more evident particularly in energy and food, and high transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand. Accordingly, while monetary policy steps of central banks in advanced economies vary with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they still continue their supportive monetary stances. Level of capacity utilization and other leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of more robust external demand even some regional differences emerge. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, risks on current account balance due to energy prices continue. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The Committee also assesses that the credit growth including the long-term investment loans and targeted usage of accessed funds for real economic activity is important for financial stability. In this context, the Committee will decisively continue to implement the strengthened macroprudential policy set by taking additional measures. Increase in inflation is driven by rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, temporary effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of strengthened measures for sustainable price and financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the base effect and the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will be implemented. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Hungary,2022-05-31,"At its meeting on 31 May 2022, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 1 June 2022:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. The Russia-Ukraine war fundamentally changed the geopolitical situation and the global economic outlook. Due to the geographical proximity and a large share of trade with the two parties involved, the events have a strong effect in Europe, especially in the Central and Eastern European region. Reaching decade highs, inflation continued to rise in a number of countries and fluctuated in double-digit territory. The war has raised inflation through higher commodity and energy prices, which has been aggravated by ongoing supply disruptions. Global investor sentiment has been volatile since the Council's previous interest rate decision. Risk appetite has been driven by news on the war, expectations for interest rate increases by the world's leading central banks, concerns caused by persistently high inflation, fears of recession and developments related to the coronavirus pandemic. Global oil prices rose over the past month. In response to high inflation becoming increasingly persistent, the world's leading central banks have tightened their monetary policy stance even amidst deteriorating prospects for economic growth in recent months. In line with expectations, the Fed continued to raise its policy rate in May and decided to start reducing its balance sheet in June. In April, the European Central Bank decided to cease its asset purchase programme (APP) in the third quarter of 2022. In the CEE region, the Czech. Polish and Romanian central banks continued to raise their key policy rates. According to preliminary data. Hungarian GDP rose by 8.2 percent in the first quarter of 2022 on a year earlier and by 2.1 percent on the fourth quarter of 2021. Despite the war situation. Hungarian economic growth continued to be strong, to which nearly all sectors of the national economy contributed. In March, industrial production and construction output continued to grow on an annual basis. The value of retail sales rose at a double-digit rate in March relative to a year earlier. The labour market remains tight and the unemployment rate continues to be low. The Hungarian economy has a strong ability to grow. The short-term economic outlook has been driven by the consequences of the war and the policy of sanctions implemented as well as by the Government's responses to this extraordinary situation. The dual nature of economic growth is expected to persist in the coming period. Strong domestic demand may partly offset the adverse effects of the Russia-Ukraine war on growth. Based on real time data, strong growth at the beginning of 2022 is expected to persist in the second quarter; however, looking ahead, a slowdown is expected due to subdued growth in external markets, the increasingly uncertain economic outlook, and high energy prices. In April 2022, annual inflation was 9.5 percent and core inflation stood at 10.3 percent. Food prices continued to exhibit a double-digit increase relative to the period a year earlier. There were significantly greater-than-usual repricings in April as well, with food prices accounting for nearly a half. External, cost-side effects continue to quickly feed through to consumer prices, and as a result they have been a major factor driving short-term inflation developments. The Government's measures affecting fuel, certain essential food products and residential energy prices significantly cushion the spillover of the increase in global commodity prices into domestic inflation. Strong negative supply effects are expected to raise inflation and core inflation further in the coming months. Rises in food prices are likely to play a central role in the increase. The inflation rate is expected to decline gradually from the autumn months. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, data on general government in the MNB's preliminary financial accounts suggest that the Hungarian debt-to-GDP ratio rose to 77.3 percent, exceeding a level of 76.6 percent at the end of 2021. The measures announced by the Government will contribute to the achievement of fiscal objectives this year and next. The current account deficit also rose in the first quarter. Weak external demand due to the war on the export side and high energy prices on the import side both point to a deterioration in the trade balance in 2022. The uncertainty surrounding the international environment has been elevated by developments in the Russia-Ukraine war and expectations about the world's leading central banks' monetary policies, which has posed a much higher risk than usual to the outlook for inflation. In the current environment, the Monetary Council deems it necessary to continue the tightening of monetary conditions and to gradually continue the base rate tightening cycle in order to anchor inflation expectations and mitigate second-round inflation risks. In the coming quarters, a key task for monetary policy is to set an optimal interest rate level that ensures the sustainable achievement of the inflation target. According to today's decision of the Monetary Council, the central bank base rate was raised by 50 basis points to 5.90 percent. The overnight deposit rate was increased by 50 basis points to 5.90 percent, and the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates were increased by 50 basis points to 8.90 percent. The MNB continues to stand ready to respond quickly and flexibly by setting the interest rate on the one-week deposit instrument if warranted by short-term risks in financial and commodity markets. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at weekly tenders; however, the central bank normally determines the one-week deposit rate on a monthly basis. The base rate will gradually catch up to the level of the one-week deposit rate evolving in the coming months. The Bank continues to place great emphasis on ensuring that short-term rates in every sub-market, particularly in the swap market, and at all times develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. To that end, the MNB will actively use its swap instrument providing foreign currency liquidity again from the beginning of June. By maintaining an active presence in the market and managing tensions potentially emerging in swap markets at the end of the quarter, the Bank strengthens the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission and thereby supports the return to price stability and its maintenance. The increase in global uncertainty, fundamental inflation risks and the setting of an optimal interest rate level in terms of the sustainable achievement of the inflation target warrant the gradual continuation of the base rate tightening cycle. The MNB continuously monitors developments in financial market risks as well and stands ready to intervene in a flexible manner using every instrument in its monetary policy toolkit, if necessary. Maintaining tighter monetary conditions for a longer period is warranted to manage increasing second-round inflation risks resulting from persistently negative supply effects. The Monetary Council will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes until the outlook for inflation stabilises around the central bank target and inflation risks become evenly balanced on the horizon of monetary policy."
Ukraine,2022-06-02,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to raise the key policy rate to 25% per annum. Along with other measures, this resolute step aims to protect households' income and savings in the hryvnia, raise the attractiveness of hryvnia assets, reduce the pressure on the foreign exchange market, and thus enhance the NBU's capability to maintain the stability of the exchange rate and restrain inflation processes during the war. Changes in consumer and economic behavior of businesses and households require returning to market-driven financial system management. At the start of the large-scale russian aggression, the NBU decided to refrain from taking any key policy rate decisions. This approach was justified by a strong psychological pressure caused by the war. Therefore, changing the key policy rate was unlikely to stabilize expectations and encourage keeping hryvnia assets, in particular to support the fixed exchange rate. The NBU aimed its monetary policy measures primarily on ensuring uninterrupted functioning of the banking system and payments in the economy. Fixing the exchange rate was supported by FX restrictions imposed to reduce demand for foreign currencies and the NBU's interventions to sell foreign currency in order to cover the remaining FX deficit of on the interbank market. At the same time, the gradual adaptation of Ukraine's economy and the psychological shock giving way to the economic decision-making logics of businesses and households require changing the approach to monetary policy. As yields on hryvnia assets are low now, the threat has grown that the economy dollarization might rise and the financial system might lose respective resources. Depreciation expectations of households and businesses are not stable and are susceptible to war developments, in particular to changes on the frontline and other situational factors. As a result, the NBU has increased its interventions to sell foreign currency, from the monthly average of USD 2 billion in MarchApril to USD 3.4 billion in May. In addition, the difference in the cash market exchange rate and the official one widened in May, which worsened negative effects on the economy from existence of multiple exchange rates caused by restrictions on FX transactions and cross-border transfers. Although Ukraine's international reserves are still sufficient thanks to funding from international partners, risks to macrofinancial stability have risen in the medium term. If yields on hryvnia assets do not rise sufficiently, international reserves will keep depleting rapidly and imbalances will build up in the economy. Inflation development requires the NBU to return to active interest rate policy in order to prevent a further deterioration in inflation expectations and dollarization of the economy. In April, inflation accelerated to 16.4% yoy. In particular, core inflation rose to 13%. In monthly terms, prices grew by 3.1%. According to the NBU's preliminary estimates, inflation continued to accelerate in annual terms in May. Inflation was curbed by a certain recovery in economic activity, gradual setup of logistics, and an increase in supply from both domestic producers and importers. Relatively low demand and excess of agricultural raw materials also restrained the price growth. Measures taken by the NBU also played an important role, in particular fixing the exchange rate of the hryvnia and limiting exchange rate fluctuations on the interbank market, which was reflected in prices of goods and services of critical imports. Administrative caps on prices imposed by the government also reined in inflationary processes. The liberation of Ukraine's northern regions (Kyiv. Chernihiv, and Sumy oblasts) and the Ukrainian army's resistance against the enemy in southern and eastern regions restrained the deterioration in inflation expectations. At the same time, the disruption of production and logistics by the war is fueling inflation. High global energy prices also remain a significant inflationary factor, putting pressure on consumer inflation, both directly and indirectly, through higher production costs. Global inflation is also at a record-high. In particular, the inflation rate in the United States and euro area countries is over 8%. This factor is also pushing up domestic prices. Despite the gradual recovery of the economy, the upward trend in inflation will continue in the coming months. This could worsen inflation expectations even further, and encourage depositors to convert their hryvnia savings into FX ones. The NBU's return to an active interest rate policy will prevent these negative trends. A decisive rise in the key policy rate will spur investors' interest in hryvnia assets, while also easing pressures on international reserves and reining in inflation. After considering several scenarios, the NBU decided to raise the key policy rate by a whole of 15 pp, to 25% per per annum. The NBU believes that a slight increase in the key policy rate would have had no significant influence on the financial and economic system. The first reason for this is that the monetary transmission mechanism has only a limited effect in wartime. Second, this would have resulted in expectations of further increases in the key policy rate and, consequently, depositors taking a wait-and-see approach and, investors having weak interest in hryvnia assets. Third, to revive interest in hryvnia assets, their yields must exceed expected inflation rates. The NBU has also decided to widen the interest corridor for monetary transactions with banks to provide additional room for reviving the interbank market. More specifically, from 3 June, the interest rate on refinancing loans will equal the key policy rate plus 2 pp, while that on certificates of deposit will be the key policy rate less 2 pp. The NBU expects that the government and the banks will respond adequately to the hike in the key policy rate by raising interest rates on domestic government debt securities and deposits. An appropriate response of market interest rates to the key policy rate hike will make hryvnia assets, including domestic government debt securities, more attractive, preventing household income and savings from being eroded by inflation. More attractive hryvnia savings will help decrease demand on the FX market. This will prevent the further accumulation of imbalances, ease pressures on Ukraine's international reserves, and will gradually resolve the issue of multiple exchange rates. Setting market rates on domestic government debt securities will also help increase demand for these assets. At the same time, this will decrease the government's need for monetary financing by the NBU. The re-imposition of taxes on imports should be important step in balancing fiscal and monetary policies. On the one hand, this will secure additional revenues for the state budget, while on the other hand it will increase incentives for domestic producers and ease pressure on international reserves. The NBU expects that a significant rise in the key policy rate, to 25%, will be sufficient to ease pressures on the FX market and stabilize inflation expectations, which in the future will lay the foundations for a monetary policy easing cycle. This step is also required to maintain a stable exchange rate, which under the current circumstances remains an important precondition for ensuring price and financial stability. The decision to raise the key policy rate, to 25%, from 3 June 2022 was approved by an NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No. 262-rsh, dated 2 June 2022. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 13 June 2022. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 21 July 2022, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
Kazakhstan,2022-06-06,"Press Release  15 The base rate remains unchanged at 14% June 6, 2022г. Nur-Sultan The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to set the base rate at 14% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1.00 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities set on 15% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 13%. The decision takes into account the current balance of risks of inflation in the short and medium term, as well as the updated forecasts of the National Bank. This level of the base rate in the absence of new shocks will ensure a smooth decline in inflation by 2024. Normalization of monetary conditions will occur as the inflationary processes slow down in 2023. In May 2022, annual inflation continued to accelerate, amounting to 14%. Acceleration of all components of the consumer price index is observed. The largest contribution to annual inflation continues to come from rising food prices. Amid disruptions in logistics supply chains and steady demand, the upward trend in prices for goods with a high import component continued. Inflation was restrained by the moratorium on price increases for regulated utilities and fuels and lubricants. Although monthly inflation continued to slow down in May to 1.4% (2% in April), it is still high and above the historical average. The low deceleration rate of monthly inflation is associated with both steady domestic demand with a positive fiscal impulse and elevated inflation expectations. Quantified inflation expectations for the year ahead in May 2022 amounted to 11.7%. In April- May this year, after a sharp increase in March, inflation expectations for the year ahead slightly decreased. The respondents expecting an increase in prices on the horizon of one year linked formed expectations to a rise in the cost of food. The perception of inflation also remains at a high level. The economy is growing faster than expected. In January-April 2022. GDP growth was 4.4%. Despite the geopolitical situation in the world and the accident at the CPC oil pipeline, the economy continued to grow. Amid the rise in world prices for raw materials and the lifting of quarantine restrictions, all major sectors of the economy demonstrated high growth rates. Consumer demand indicators reflect positive dynamics. Thus, in April of this year the growth of retail turnover recovered after a significant decline due to the January events in the country. In particular, the food products turnover recovered after its fall to the negative zone in the first quarter of this year. Continuing growth of consumer crediting caused a rapid recovery of non-food turnover in February with further acceleration in April of this year. After a slight slowdown at the end of 2021, the growth of investment in housing construction accelerated in the first quarter of 2022, which is due to the high demand of the population due to the increased volume of early withdrawals of pension savings to improve housing conditions. Against this background, prices in the real estate market in annual terms continue to maintain an upward trend. The global economy is expected to grow weaker than previously expected. 1 Consensus Ecs. expects Russia's economy to contract by 9% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023. The EU economy is expected to grow at 2.8% in 2022 and 2.3% in 2023. Inflation in the trading partner countries continues to accelerate. Inflation in the Eurozone accelerated in May 2022 to 8.1% amid rising energy prices, with peak inflation expected in the second quarter of 2022. Inflation in Russia in April this year was 17.8% against a background of rising food and non-food prices. In China, inflation is also projected to accelerate further from the current level of 2.1% in April 2022, but at a more moderate pace due to weak growth in consumer activity. Despite a slight decline for the second month in a row. FAO food price index remains close to the record levels, amounting to 157.4 points in May of this year. In May, there was a decrease in prices for vegetable oils, dairy products and sugar. At the same time, the sub-indices of prices for grains and meat increased. High oil prices in the global market are supported by a partial EU embargo on oil from Russia, and simultaneously restrained by fears of a re-quarantine in China due to the spread of the coronavirus. The pressure of high energy prices and the winding down of stimulus programs by the central banks of the leading economies is expected to dampen demand to some degree in the future. By the end of 2022, due to the expected increase in oil production in the US and OPEC+ countries (due to the termination of the agreement by the end of 2022), prices are likely to decline slightly. Thus, in 2022, the average oil price is expected to be around $100 per barrel, and in 2023 it is expected to be around $90/barrel. Given the forecasts of international organizations and factors affecting the future trajectory of oil prices, the price of Brent crude oil under the baseline scenario is set at $90/bbl until the end of the forecast. According to the updated forecasts of the National Bank, economic growth in Kazakhstan in 2022 will be at 2.83.8%. Dynamic GDP growth rates will be associated with the already established high actual growth for January-April 2022, as well as the expected positive dynamics in all major sectors of the economy until the end of the year. However, the geopolitical crisis, weakening external demand and restructuring of supply chains will restrain the acceleration of economic growth. Possible problems in accessing the international export markets of Kazakhstan against the background of geopolitical uncertainty are the risk to the GDP forecast, which, if implemented, may have a negative impact on the revision of GDP growth forecast towards lower rates. In 2023. GDP growth is projected to accelerate to 3.54.5%. Economic growth will be supported by the expected normalization of export and import supply chains coupled with a reduction of uncertainty in the economy, a significant increase in energy production compared to 2022 due to the easing of OPEC+ restrictions and the anticipated end of the oil-producing countries' deal. The continued positive dynamics of domestic demand will also provide support. In 2024, the economy is projected to continue growing on the background of the exhaustion of the negative impact of shocks and a significant increase in oil production, provided large oil and gas projects are implemented. Given the current decision on the base rate, inflation by the end of 2022 is projected at 13 15%. The greatest rise in prices is expected for food products, taking into account the dynamics of prices on foreign and domestic food markets. There are significant risks of a sharp rise in prices for regulated utilities in the second half of 2022 due to the end of the moratorium on their increase, as well as growth in prices for market services in the context of high inflation expectations. This forecast was formed taking into account a set of measures of the Government to control and reduce the level of inflation, the successful implementation of which will allow inflation to fall to the lower boundary of the forecast. 2 In 2023, inflation will gradually slow down to 7.59.5% amid the high inflation base of 2022, the decision made on the base rate, the gradual reduction of external inflationary pressure, and the planned implementation of the countercyclical budget rule. In the absence of both external and internal new shocks in 2024, inflation will still be outside the target corridor, while it is projected to slow down to its upper limit. The main risks of inflation acceleration are related to uncertainty regarding the background of geopolitical situation in the world, probability of capital outflow from developing markets in favor of developed markets, import of external inflation, in particular from Russia, as well as the risks from supply factors and unanchored inflation expectations. Another important risk of the forecast is the possible upward revision of the budget expenditures compared to the parameters provided by the Law on the Republican Budget for 20222024. Further decisions on the base rate will be taken subject to the conformity of the actual dynamics of inflation with the forecasted trajectory and the emerging balance of risks in the external environment and the domestic economy. The next scheduled decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on July 25, 2022 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time."
Chile,2022-06-07,"NoPtrae sdse R eplereasnes*a Tuesday, 7 June 2022 Monetary Policy Meeting  June 2022 At its monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 75 basis points to 9%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of the Board members. World inflation and expectations have continued to rise, reflecting more widespread and persistent price increases. Worth noting is the impact of Russia's protracted invasion of Ukraine on the rise in commodity prices, especially energy and foods, which are expected to remain high for an extended period of time. Central banks have continued to raise their benchmark rates and/or have signaled a path of more rapid withdrawal of monetary stimulus. Global growth expectations have deteriorated in the face of worsening global financial conditions, the evolution of the conflict in Europe and the weakening of the Chinese economy. Since the last Meeting, global financial markets have shown mixed results, in a scenario that maintains high levels of volatility. Long‐term interest rates have moderated their upward trend in recent weeks. The dollar continues to appreciate globally, despite a partial reversal lately. The oil price has continued to rise (+10% since the last Meeting, in the WTI‐Brent average), while the copper price has shown some fluctuations, hovering around US$4.3 per pound (4% since the last Meeting). The local financial market has performed more favorably than its external peers. Long‐term rates have retreated compared to the last Meeting, approaching the levels they showed at the end of March. The exchange rate has appreciated. The IPSA has accumulated gains, in a context of good corporate results and higher commodity prices. Local bank credit remains weak, with low monthly lending flows in all portfolios. Financing conditions remain tight. The economy is receding at a slower than expected pace, as consumption has remained strong. In the first quarter, the seasonally adjusted non‐mining GDP series fell 0.2% quarter‐on‐quarter, a smaller decline than estimated in the March Report. In April, the non‐mining component of the Imacec was higher than expected. Partial data for the second quarter confirm the strength of consumption, while investment continues to weaken. In the labor market, there is a decline in demand for employees and a slowdown in job creation. Business and consumer expectations have deteriorated further. Headline inflation continued to rise, totaling 10.5% annually in April, with the annual variation of the core component standing at 8.3%. The April CPI was again higher than expected in the March Report, again owing mainly to the rise in food prices —volatile and core— and other volatile components, including fuels. The rest of the core components did not deviate from projections. Inflation expectations obtained from surveys —the EES and FTS— still place it above 3% in the two‐year horizon. In view of the background information contained in the June Report, the Board estimates that to ensure the convergence of inflation to 3% within the two‐year horizon, additional adjustments to the MPR will be needed, although smaller in magnitude. The Board will remain attentive to the evolution of inflation and its determinants as risks remain high, particularly considering inflation's high level and increased persistence. The Monetary Policy Report due to be published tomorrow contains the details of the central scenario, the sensitivities and risks surrounding it, and its implications for the future evolution of the monetary policy interest rate. Nota de prensa The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Thursday 23 June 2022. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will take place on Tuesday 12 and Wednesday 13 July 2022, and the statement thereof will be released at 18:00 hours of this latter date. ___The Spanish original prevails.

India,2022-06-08,"Monetary Policy Statement, 2022-23 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) June 6-8, 2022 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (June 8, 2022) decided to: Increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 50 basis points to 4.90 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 4.65 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 5.15 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below Assessment Global Economy 2. Since the MPC's meeting in May 2022, the global economy continues to grapple with multi-decadal high inflation and slowing growth, persisting geopolitical tensions and sanctions, elevated prices of crude oil and other commodities and lingering COVID-19 related supply chain bottlenecks. Global financial markets have been roiled by turbulence amidst growing stagflation concerns, leading to a tightening of global financial conditions and risks to the growth outlook and financial stability. Domestic Economy 3. According to the provisional estimates released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on May 31, 2022. India's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021-22 was 8.7 per cent. This works out to 1.5 per cent above the pre-pandemic level (2019-20). In Q4:2021-22, real GDP growth decelerated to 4.1 per cent from 5.4 per cent in Q3, dragged down mainly by weakness in private consumption on the back of the Omicron wave.2 4. Available information for April-May 2022 indicates a broadening of the recovery in economic activity. Urban demand is recovering and rural demand is gradually improving. Merchandise exports posted robust double-digit growth for the fifteenth month in a row during May while non-oil non-gold imports continued to expand at a healthy pace, pointing to recovery of domestic demand. Overall system liquidity remains in large surplus, with the average daily absorption under the LAF moderating to ₹5.5 lakh crore during May 4 - May 31 from ₹7.4 lakh crore during April 8 - May 3, 2022 in consonance with the policy of gradual withdrawal of accommodation. Money supply (M3) and bank credit from commercial banks rose (y-o-y) by 8.8 per cent and 12.1 per cent, respectively, as on May 20, 2022. India's foreign exchange reserves were placed at US$ 601.4 billion as on May 27, 2022. CPI headline inflation rose further from 7.0 per cent in March 2022 to 7.8 per cent in April 2022, reflecting broad-based increase in all its major constituents. Food inflation pressures accentuated, led by cereals, milk, fruits, vegetables, spices and prepared meals. Fuel inflation was driven up by a rise in LPG and kerosene prices. Core inflation (i.e. CPI excluding food and fuel) hardened across almost all components, dominated by the transport and communication sub-group. Outlook 7. The tense global geopolitical situation and the consequent elevated commodity prices impart considerable uncertainty to the domestic inflation outlook. The restrictions on wheat exports should improve the domestic supplies but the shortfall in the rabi production due to the heat wave could be an offsetting risk. The forecast of a normal south-west monsoon augurs well for the kharif agricultural production and the food price outlook. Edible oil prices remain under pressure on adverse global supply conditions, notwithstanding some recent correction due to the lifting of export ban by a major supplier. Consequent to the recent reduction in excise duties, domestic retail prices of petroleum products have moderated. International crude oil prices, however, remain elevated, with risks of further pass-through to domestic pump prices. There are also upside risks from revisions in the prices of electricity. Early results from manufacturing, services and infrastructure sector firms polled in the Reserve Bank's surveys expect further input and output price pressures going forward. Taking into account these factors, and on the assumption of a normal monsoon in 2022 and average crude oil price (Indian basket) of US$ 105 per barrel, inflation is now projected at 6.7 per cent in 2022-23, with Q1 at 7.5 per cent; Q2 at 7.4 per cent; Q3 at 6.2 per cent; and Q4 at 5.8 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 1). The recovery in domestic economic activity is gathering strength. Rural consumption should benefit from the likely normal south-west monsoon and the expected improvement in agricultural prospects. A rebound in contact-intensive services is likely to bolster urban consumption, going forward. Investment activity is expected to be supported by improving capacity utilisation, the government's capex push, and strengthening bank credit. Growth of merchandise and services exports is set to sustain the recent buoyancy. Spillovers from prolonged geopolitical tensions, elevated commodity prices, continued supply bottlenecks and tightening global financial conditions nevertheless weigh on the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, the real GDP growth projection for 2022-23 is retained at 7.2 per cent,3 with Q1 at 16.2 per cent; Q2 at 6.2 per cent; Q3 at 4.1 per cent; and Q4 at 4.0 per cent, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 2). Inflation risks flagged in the April and May resolutions of the MPC have materialised. The projections indicate that inflation is likely to remain above the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent through the first three quarters of 2022-23. Considerable uncertainty surrounds the inflation trajectory due to global growth risks and geopolitical tensions. The supply side measures taken by the government would help to alleviate some cost-push pressures. At the same time, however, the MPC notes that continuing shocks to food inflation could sustain pressures on headline inflation. Persisting inflationary pressures could set in motion second round effects on headline CPI. Hence, there is a need for calibrated monetary policy action to keep inflation expectations anchored and restrain the broadening of price pressures. Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.90 per cent. All members of the MPC  Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma. Dr.Rajiv Ranjan. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das  unanimously voted to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.90 per cent. All members, namely. Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma. Dr.Rajiv Ranjan. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das unanimously voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published on June 22, 2022. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during August 2-4, 2022.

Poland,2022-06-08,"Warsaw, 8 June 2022 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 8 June 2022 The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.75 percentage points, i.e. to 6.00%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: ▪ lombard rate at 6.50%; ▪ deposit rate at 5.50%; ▪ rediscount rate at 6.05%; ▪ discount rate at 6.10%. Incoming data indicate a gradual slowdown in global growth. In recent months economic conditions deteriorated markedly in some emerging market economies, including in China, amid still relatively favourable economic conditions in the biggest advanced economies. Global activity is under the negative impact of high prices of commodities and of production components, persisting disruptions in the functioning of global supply chains and the repercussions of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine. Global inflation continues to rise, reaching in many economies the highest levels in decades. At the same time, inflation forecasts for the coming quarters are being significantly revised upwards. The main source of growing inflation continue to be high commodity prices as well as prolonged disruptions in global supply chains and international transport, amplified by the effects of war. In some economies, rising prices are also driven by high demand growth and increasing labour costs. As a consequence, core inflation is also increasing. Amidst a strong increase in inflation, many central banks are tightening their monetary policy. The US Federal Reserve concluded net asset purchases and increases interest rates. The ECB keeps negative interest rates, although it has been reducing the scale of asset purchases. Central banks in many economies, including in the Central-Eastern Europe region, continue to increase interest rates. In Poland. GDP growth in 2022 Q1 according to Statistics Poland preliminary estimate  stood at 8.5% y/y, with a significant contribution of change in inventories, while both consumption and investment growth declined. Available data point to continuing 1/3 favourable economic conditions in 2022 Q2, however, economic activity growth will decelerate. Meanwhile, employment continues to increase accompanied by a further fall in unemployment and a marked rise in wages. A continuation of relatively favourable economic conditions may be expected in the coming quarters, although a further slowdown of economic growth is forecast, while both the domestic and global outlook is subject to significant uncertainty. Inflation in Poland  according to Statistics Poland flash estimate  increased in May 2022 to 13.9% y/y. Elevated inflation results mainly from a strong rise in global energy and agricultural commodity prices  driven, to a large extent, by the repercussions of Russian military aggression against Ukraine  and earlier increases in regulated tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy. Consequences of disruptions in global supply chains and high shipping costs in international trade also boost inflation. At the same time, continued robust demand which enables enterprises to pass rising costs on to the final prices has had also a positive contribution to the price growth in Poland. In turn, a curbing impact on inflation has been exerted by a reduction in some tax rates as part of the Anti- inflationary Shield. In the coming quarters, it is expected that the impact of factors currently amplifying price growth will persist, including those related to the Russian military aggression against Ukraine. Meanwhile, the NBP interest rates increases, together with fading of the impact of shocks currently boosting prices will contribute to a gradual fall in inflation in the coming years. The decrease in inflation should also be supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council's assessment, will be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy. The Council assessed, that there persists a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. In order to reduce this risk, i.e. striving to decrease inflation to the NBP target in the medium term, the Council decided to increase NBP interest rates again. The increase of the NBP interest rates will also curb inflation expectations. Further decisions of the Council will depend on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy. NBP will take all necessary actions in order to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability, including above all to reduce the risk of inflation remaining elevated. NBP may 2/3 intervene in the foreign exchange market, in particular to limit fluctuations of the zloty exchange rate that are inconsistent with the direction of monetary policy."
Thailand,2022-06-08,"Mr. Piti Disyatat. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 8 June 2022 as follows. The Committee voted 4 to 3 to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent. Three members voted to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point. The Committee assesses that the Thai economy will continue to recover and could expand faster than previously expected owing to stronger domestic demand and the pickup in foreign tourists. Headline inflation would increase and remain elevated for longer than previously estimated, due to the increase in oil prices and higher cost passthrough. The Committee deems that a very accommodative monetary policy will be less needed going forward. However to ensure that the recovery will continue to gain traction as anticipated, most members voted to maintain the policy rate in this meeting and will reassess the risks to growth and inflation going forward. Meanwhile three members view that policy normalization is warranted in this meeting given the increased upside risks to both growth and inflation. The Committee assesses that the Thai economy will expand at 33 percent in 2022 and 42 percent in 2023 on the back of better-than-expected recovery in domestic consumption, especially in the services sector. Foreign tourist arrivals also improve following the faster relaxation of border controls in Thailand and other countries. Furthermore the labor market and household income show signs of improvement as economic activities continue to expand in tandem with the relaxation of containment measures. Meanwhile the impact of COVID-19 and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on the Thai economy will be limited. However the Committee will monitor key risk factors to economic recovery, especially the impact of higher prices on living costs for households. Headline inflation is projected to be at 62 percent in 2022 and 25 percent in 2023. Inflation will exceed the upper bound of the target range in 2022 due to increasing domestic energy prices and higher cost passthrough that have broadened into wider ranges of products. The rise in inflation has been mainly due to cost-push factors while medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range. Nonetheless inflation risks increase significantly from uncertainties surrounding global energy prices, the possibilities of broader and faster cost passthrough, and rising demand-side inflationary pressure as the economic recovery gains strength. The Committee would closely monitor inflation dynamics, cost passthrough, and medium-term inflation expectations. 2 Overall financial system remains resilient. Commercial banks have high levels of capital fund and loan loss provision. Liquidity in the financial system remains ample, although liquidity distribution still varies across economic sectors. Some households and businesses remain vulnerable to rising living and production costs as their incomes have not fully recovered in addition to their high levels of debt. The Committee views that financial institutions should continue with debt restructuring in a sustainable manner to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers' long-term debt serviceability, especially with a focus on targeted measures for vulnerable groups. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative albeit volatilities increase in financial markets. On exchange rates, the baht has depreciated relative to the US dollar in line with regional currencies. Long-term government bond yields rose in tandem with the monetary policy outlook in advanced economies and the expectation of domestic monetary policy normalization in the period ahead. The Committee will closely monitor developments and volatilities in financial markets. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee assesses that the economic recovery has continued to gain more traction, while the upside inflationary risks continued to increase. Thus the Committee deems that a very accommodative monetary policy will be less needed going forward. The Committee will assess the appropriate timing for a gradual policy normalization in accordance with the shift in the outlook and risks surrounding growth and inflation."
Peru,2022-06-09,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT JUNE 2022 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 5.50% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 50 bps to 5.50 percent, thus continuing to normalize its monetary policy stance. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation increased from 7.96 percent in April to 8.09 percent in May, above the target range, due to the upsurge of significant increases in international food and fuel prices. Year-on-year core inflation also rose from 3.81 percent in April to 4.26 percent in May, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The significant and continuous increase in international energy and food prices since the second half of last year, accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in global inflation in magnitudes not seen in many years both in advanced and other economies in the region. Thus, inflation is expected to return to the target range between the second and the third quarter of next year. The downward path of year-on-year inflation is expected to begin in July, as transitory pressures (exchange rate and international fuel and grain prices) begin to recede, with economic activity still below potential. One-year-ahead expected inflation increased from 4.62 to 4.89 percent between April and May, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most leading indicators and expectations for economic activity remain pessimistic but recovered in May. Global economic activity is improving at a slower pace due to the persistent bottlenecks in the global supply of goods and services, the reversal of monetary stimulus in advanced economies, the confinement measures in China, and international conflicts. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants, including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, with an aim to consider changes in the monetary stance so that inflation returns to the target range over the forecast horizon. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 3.50 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 6.0 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months and the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months. In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates based on the amount of the operations. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on July 7, 2022."
Russia,2022-06-10,"On 10 June 2022, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 150 basis points to 9.50% per annum. The external environment for the Russian economy remains challenging and significantly constrains economic activity. At the same time, inflation is slowing faster and the decline in economic activity is of a smaller magnitude than the Bank of Russia expected in April. Recent data suggest that price growth rates in May and early June have been low. This comes as a result of ruble exchange rate movements and the tailing-off of the surge in consumer demand in the context of a marked decline in inflation expectations of households and businesses. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will total 14.017.0% in 2022, decline to 5.07.0% in 2023 and return to 4% in 2024. Inflation movements. Current inflation is appreciably below the Bank of Russia's April forecast. As of 3 June, annual inflation is down to 17.0% (vs 17.8% in April). Based on the latest data, growth rates of consumer prices have been low in May and early June. The decline in headline inflation is largely due to a correction in prices for a small group of goods and services, after they went up sharply in March. This comes as a result of ruble exchange rate movements and the tailing-off of the surge in consumer demand in the context of a marked decline in inflation expectations of households and businesses. At the same time, current rates of price growth in the greater part of the consumer basket, although having dropped, are still significantly above 4% annualised. The Bank of Russia's baseline scenario expects annual inflation to run at 14.017.0% by the end of 2022. Inflation movements will be shaped including by such impactful factors as the efficiency of import substitution processes and the scale and speed at which imports of finished goods, raw materials and components will be recovering. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reduce to 5.07.0% in 2023 to return to 4% in 2024. Monetary conditions are overall tight, having softened unevenly across various segments of the financial market. OFZ yields and interest rates in the credit and deposit market have turned downwards. With deposit rates dropping, the inflow of funds into term ruble deposits has slowed. At the same time, price and non-price bank lending conditions have remained rigid on the back of a higher risk premium factored into lending rates and tighter borrower requirements of banks. This leaves retail and corporate lending operations weak. Credit gained support from government-subsidised lending programmes. The Bank of Russia's decisions in April-June to reduce the key rate will boost the availability of credit resources in the economy and limit the scale of economic decline. At the same time, the monetary policy stance will retain its necessary disinflationary impact to bring inflation back to target in 2024. Economic activity. High-frequency indicators point to a halt in the decline in business activity in May after it dropped sharply in April. At the same time, trends across sectors were mixed. The decline in economic activity is caused by developments in both demand and supply. Survey data show that enterprises are still struggling to fix production and logistics — despite the nascent diversification in suppliers of finished products, raw materials and components, as well as in sales markets. Consumer activity in real terms is on the decline as households show a high propensity to save and real incomes shrink. The external environment for the Russian economy remains challenging and significantly constrains economic activity. The contraction in imports due to the introduction of external trade and financial restrictions is considerably outstripping the decline in exports. Overall, the actual decrease in economic activity in 2022 Q2 is less pronounced than the Bank of Russia assumed in its April baseline scenario. Given the above, the Bank of Russia estimates that the 2022 GDP decline could be lower than forecast in April. Inflation risks. Proinflationary risks continue to abate, though remaining considerable. The movements of the economy and inflation largely depend on fiscal policy decisions. The Bank of Russia takes into account the decisions already made regarding the mid-term expenditure path of the federal budget and the fiscal system as a whole. In case of a further budget deficit expansion, tighter monetary policy may be required to return inflation to target in 2024 and keep it close to 4% further on. Over a short-term horizon, the effect of proinflationary factors is likely to be accentuated by high and unanchored inflation expectations. An excessive reduction in households' propensity to save may lead to consumer demand outstripping the capacity to expand output. Disinflationary risks to the baseline scenario are mainly linked to a consistently high risk premium in credit rates and banks' elevated requirements for borrowers amid high uncertainty. This may cause a greater slowdown in lending. The combination of risks created by the external environment may produce both proinflationary and disinflationary effects. A further aggravation of external trade and financial restrictions may have a proinflationary effect, thereby leading to a sharper decline in the potential of the Russian economy than expected in the baseline scenario. Supply-side constraints may in particular strengthen because of a slow replenishment of stocks of finished goods, raw materials and components in the event of persistently negative trends in imports. The materialisation of growing risks of a global recession could in turn further weaken external demand for Russian exports. Disinflationary effects could be a result of a persistently high trade surplus amid more sustainable growth in exports compared to imports. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 22 July 2022. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the medium-term forecast are to be published at 13.30 Moscow time. 1 Taking into account that from 1 January to 13 June 2022 the average key rate is 13.8%, it is forecast to be in the range of 8.59.5% from 14 June through the end of 2022.

Armenia,2022-06-14,"PRESS RELEASE 14.06.2022 Refinancing Rate Set at 9.25% At June 14, 2022 meeting, the CBA Board decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at 9.25%. In May 2022, 12-month inflation grew to 9.0%. Meanwhile, the 12-month core inflation grew as well, making 8.4%. The Russian-Ukrainian conflict continues to have a negative impact on the economic and financial market developments in Armenia's' main partner countries. Continuing disruption of the global value chains and the rise in prices in international commodity markets is leading to an expansion of global inflationary environment. Central banks of the advanced economies have been tightening monetary policy conditions at a relatively faster pace. As a result, inflationary impact on the Armenian economy from the external sector still persists. In the second quarter of 2022, the Armenian economy stayed exceedingly active. Substantial influx of international visitors and the augmented domestic private spending have been contributing to the growth of the services sector and the aggregate demand. This resulted in an expansion of general inflationary environment and higher inflation expectations. The significant growth of services exports and financial inflows also contribute to the appreciation of the Armenian dram in foreign exchange markets. It is expected that in the near future the latter will have a positive impact on mitigation of the domestic inflationary environment. In view of the above, the Board judges appropriate to leave the policy rate unchanged. The CBA Board will be committed to take adequate measures to control inflation and neutralize any risk of deanchoring of inflation expectations. In the medium term, the 12-month inflation is projected to gradually decline to a 4% target. The CBA Board considers that as a result of the geopolitical developments, the uncertainty of macroeconomic perspective still persists. At the same time, the risks of inflation deviation from the projected trajectory are mostly balanced. Should the risks materialize in any direction, the Board stands ready to respond accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective. Detailed information on the basis for determining the interest rate can be found in the Inflation Report to be published by June 28, 2022 (Monetary Policy Program for the second quarter of 2022)."
Brazil,2022-06-15,"In its 247th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate to 13.25% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's scenario:. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; and an increase in the risk premium due to the uncertainty about the country's future fiscal framework and fiscal policies that support aggregate demand, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset prices. Among the downside risks, it should be noted a possible reversion, even if partial, of the increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency; and a greater deceleration of economic activity than projected. The Committee assessed that the tax measures under the approval process imply a sizable reduction in inflation in the current year, although it raises by a smaller magnitude inflation in the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The Committee assesses that the uncertain and volatile current scenario requires serenity when evaluating the risks. Taking into account the assessed scenarios, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 0.50 p.p. to 13.25% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment. The Committee considers that, given its inflation projections and the risk of a deanchoring of long-term expectations, it is appropriate to continue advancing in the process of monetary tightening significantly into even more restrictive territory. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process consolidates and anchors expectations around its targets. For its next meeting, the Committee foresees a new adjustment, of the same or lower magnitude. The Committee stresses that the growing uncertainty of the current scenario, coupled with the advanced stage of the current monetary policy cycle, and its impacts yet to be observed, require additional caution in its actions. The Copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto de Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Diogo Abry Guillen. Fernanda Magalhaes Rumenos Guardado. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza and Renato Dias de Brito Gomes. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
United States,2022-06-15,"EDT June 15, 2022 Overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The invasion and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. In addition. COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT June 15, 2022pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Cook; Patrick Harker; Philip N Jefferson; Loretta J Mester; and Christopher J. Voting against this action was Esther L George, who preferred at this meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.5 percentage point to 1-1/4 percent to 1-1/2 percent. Patrick Harker voted as an alternate member at this meeting."
Czech Republic,2022-06-22,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank increased the two-week repo rate to 7.00%, i.e. by 1.25 percentage points. At the same time, it increased the discount rate to 6.00% and the Lombard rate to 8.00%. Five members voted in favour of this decision and two members voted for leaving rates unchanged.. This decision of the Bank Board is underpinned by the spring macroeconomic forecast and by an assessment of information obtained since it was prepared. Consistent with the baseline scenario of the spring forecast is a further sharp rise in market interest rates. The Bank Board assessed the risks and uncertainties of the spring forecast in light of the new information as being markedly inflationary and acting towards a need for further significant tightening of monetary policy. The war in Ukraine and anti-epidemic measures in China are dampening the growth of the global economy. The euro area countries have so far withstood the adverse geopolitical developments, so the GDP outlook for the effective euro area has shifted slightly higher for this year. By contrast, the outlook for 2023 has worsened slightly. The complicated situation with supplies of materials and components, coupled with the price of oil, which is higher than in the spring forecast, is reflected in a higher outlook for industrial producer prices. Consumer price inflation has also been revised upwards. The European Central Bank is expected to raise interest rates several times in the months ahead, so the outlook for foreign market rates is slightly higher. Both the current Brent crude oil price and its outlook are higher than assumed by the current forecast. The expected euro-dollar exchange rate is weaker over the entire forecast horizon due to more forceful monetary policy tightening by the Fed. Domestic inflation increased significantly further during Q2, reaching 16% in May. It was about one percentage point above the forecast. More than one-half of this was due to higher-than-expected core inflation caused by unexpectedly strong growth in prices of both tradables and non-tradables. Imputed rent and prices in restaurants and cafes are the biggest contributors to the growth in services prices. Fuel prices were also higher than expected in May. Growth in food prices and administered prices was only slightly higher than in the spring forecast. According to the spring forecast, inflation will be in double figures this year but will fall quickly in the first half of next year and return close to the 2% target in late 2023. Annual GDP growth was one percentage point faster than forecasted in 2022 Q1. The deviation from the forecast was due almost solely to stronger-than-expected investment activity. This occurred despite rapid growth in prices of capital goods and a rise in uncertainty connected with the war in Ukraine. The dynamics of exports and imports were also higher than forecasted, while the contribution of net exports was broadly as expected. Household consumption and additions to inventories were in line with the projection. By contrast, growth in government consumption lagged behind expectations. According to the spring forecast, the Czech economy will slow markedly this year and even decline slightly in year-on-year terms in the second half of the year. Economic growth will recover next year. Industrial production dropped further year on year in April, but this was mostly due to base effects. Leading indicators are signalling no major weakening of industrial activity for now. Growth in construction output slowed year on year in April, as did growth in retail sales. The tightness in the domestic labour market is still increasing slightly. The share of unemployed persons declined slightly in April and May, whereas the forecast had expected it to increase. This was due to higher employment of refugees from Ukraine. Average wage growth in market sectors remained buoyant in Q1, despite being slightly slower than forecasted. So far in Q2, the koruna has been 2.5% weaker against the euro compared with the spring forecast. Despite a rising interest rate differential, this is due to a sharp weakening of the domestic currency in May, which reflected a change in financial market sentiment regarding the future course of domestic interest rates. Further depreciation of the koruna is being prevented by foreign exchange market interventions by the Czech National Bank. To sum up the materialisation of the spring forecast, inflation in May and economic growth in Q1 were both roughly one percentage point higher. By contrast, the average wage in the economy in Q1 and the share of unemployed persons so far in Q2 were lower. The Bank Board assessed the risks and uncertainties of the spring forecast as being markedly inflationary and acting towards a need for further significant tightening of monetary policy. In particular, higher price growth at home and abroad is having an inflationary effect. This is due, among other things, to a sharp rise in energy and commodity prices amid concerns about Russian supplies being cut off. The upside risks also include a weaker koruna exchange rate and the threat of inflation expectations becoming unanchored from the CNB's 2% target. Another inflationary risk is the possibility of less restrictive fiscal policy this year and the next. The uncertainties include the future course of the war in Ukraine and the future monetary policy stance abroad."
Georgia,2022-06-22,"22.06.2022 The National Bank of Georgia keeps its Monetary Policy Rate unchanged at 11.0 percent On June 22, 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) decided to keep monetary policy rate (refinancing rate) unchanged. The monetary policy rate stands at 11.0 percent. Elevated inflation and inflationary risks still remain a recent global challenge. The sanctions imposed against Russia due to its aggression against Ukraine, as well as supply-side disruptions, and a sharp decline of goods exports from Ukraine due to the ongoing war, have significantly raised international prices on food, energy and other commodities. Based on the UN Food and Agricultural Organization data, in the recent months international food prices are at an all-time high. Elevated prices on international markets severely affected most countries stoking inflation both in developed and developing economies. Georgia, as a small open economy, is no exception and price increases on international markets are quickly transmitted to our consumer price index. In addition, increased number of long-term visitors from Russia. Belarus, and Ukraine have abruptly and swiftly raised rent prices on the local market. This has had a significant impact on both headline (0.6 percentage points) and core inflations (1.1 percentage points). Expected path of inflation significantly depends on global geopolitical outlook which is still surrounded by high uncertainty. Based on current information, there are cautious expectations that commodity prices on international markets would not increase further and corresponding inflationary pressure will diminish gradually over the course of the year. Given strong external demand and foreign inflows (remittances, tourism revenues, revenues from goods exports), the exchange rate has strengthened contributing to recent retreats in imported inflation. According to the current forecast, other things equal, it is expected that inflation will remain above the target throughout the year; however, it will have a declining path as external factors are phased-out and given that monetary policy remains tight. In response to rising inflationary risks, gradual increases in the policy rate over the past year has led to the tight monetary policy stance. Monetary policy will keep the tightened bias until the risks of rising inflation expectations are sufficiently mitigated. Should inflation expectations rise further and/or demand-side pressures on prices exacerbate, further tightening of monetary policy may become necessary. Despite monetary policy tightening, credit activity remains strong, partly due to consumer loans, on one hand, and foreign currency (FX) loans, on the other. In this regard, recent macroprudential measures should gradually affect credit growth. In addition, interest rates hikes by the US Federal Reserve and other leading central banks will have an additional tightening effect on credit conditions in Georgia. Nevertheless, if credit growth remains this high, the NBG will use additional instruments including FX reserve requirement and/or other macroprudential policy measures. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on August 3, 2022. However, the Committee does not rule out an extraordinary meeting either."
Mongolia,2022-06-22,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Increasing the policy rate No: 2022/03 Date: June 22, 2022 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia held scheduled meetings on June 20 and 22, 2022. Taking into consideration the current state of the economy and financial markets as well as outlook and risks to the domestic and foreign economic environment, the MPC decided to raise the policy rate by 1.0 percentage points to 10.0 percent. Annual headline inflation reached 15.1 percent nationwide and 16.2 percent in Ulaanbaatar city as of May 2022. Increases in prices of petroleum, food and imported goods comprise majority of these inflation developments. In particular, domestic petroleum prices are driven up by increased crude oil prices in global markets, while surges in food prices especially in the past 2 months are mainly explained by continued logistical delays and supply disruptions leading to higher production input and transportation costs. Moreover, rises in prices of imported goods heightened through foreign inflation and exchange rate movements are contributing to price increases in other domestic products. As the impact of these factors is likely to persist in the upcoming quarters, outlook for inflation to stabilize within the the Central bank's target interval is being delayed. Despite slowdown in coal and crude oil exports associated with border restrictions undermining growth in the mining sector, non-mining activities improved in trade, services' sectors as well as net taxes on products, boosting economic growth. Household consumption, which had been contracting consecutively for the previous 5 quarters, began to recover in the first quarter and contributed to domestic demand growth. Mining sector is projected to contract this year owing to outlook for external demand and border issues, while non-mining sector recovery is expected to continue on the back of easing of pandemic restrictions and improvements in domestic demand. Inflation expectations are mainly driven up by external factors and negative consequences of geopolitical tensions, while deficit for balance of payments is widening due to reduced coal exports as a consequence of continued border restrictions and higher imports amplified through price increases in external markets. Therefore, the MPC decided to raise the policy rate with the aim to stabilize inflation expectations in the medium term, ensure external and domestic balance at an appropriate level and maintain relative yield on togrog in an environment of rising external benchmark rate. The Bank of Mongolia will take subsequent necessary actions in a timely manner in accordance with economic recovery, inflation developments, supply-related constraints as well as the state of international relations. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Philippines,2022-06-22,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to raise the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility by 25 basis points to 2.5 percent, effective Friday, 24 June 2022. Accordingly, the interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were raised to2.0 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively. In deciding to raise the policy interest rate anew, the Monetary Board noted that upside risks continue to dominate the inflation outlook up to 2023, with pressures emanating from the potential impact of higher global non-oil prices, the continued shortage in domestic fish supply, as well as pending petitions for transport fare hikes due to elevated oil prices. Meanwhile, the impact of a weaker-than-expected global recovery and the possible reimposition of local COVID-19 restrictions amid an uptick in infections continue to be the main downside risks to the outlook. The BSP's latest baseline forecasts have shifted higher, with average inflation projected to breach the upper end of the 2-4 percent target range at 5.0 percent in 2022 and at 4.2 percent in 2023. However, average inflation is also seen to subsequently decline to 3.3 percent in 2024. At the same time, inflation expectations have continued to rise. While they remain within the target range for 2023-2024, elevated expectations highlight the risk of further second-round effects arising from sustained price pressures. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that a follow-through increase in the policy rate enables the BSP to withdraw its stimulus measures while safeguarding macroeconomic stability amid rising global commodity prices and strong external headwinds to domestic economic growth. The Monetary Board also reiterates its support for the carefully coordinated efforts of other government agencies as part of a whole-of-government approach in implementing non-monetary interventions to mitigate the impact of persistent supply-side factors on inflation. In line with the ongoing normalization of its monetary policy settings, the BSP is prepared to take all necessary policy action to bring inflation toward a target-consistent path over the medium term and deliver on its primary mandate of price stability."
Egypt,2022-06-23,"Press Release  June 23rd, 2022 MPC decides to keep key policy rates unchanged In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 1125 percent, 1225 percent, and 1175 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1175 percen. Global economic activity has slowed down due to ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukrain. Trade sanctions imposed on Russia and corresponding supply-chain bottlenecks have elevated global commodity prices, such as international prices for oil and whea. Meanwhile global financial conditions have tightened, as major central banks have continued to both tighten policy rates and reduce asset purchase programs with the aim of containing increased inflationary pressures in their respective countrie. In addition, recently reintroduced COVID-19 lockdowns in China have raised concerns about exacerbating existing global supply-chain disruption. Domestic economic activity continued to expand in 2022 Q1, albeit at a slower pace, registering a preliminary growth figure of 54 percent, compared to 83 percent in 2021 Q4. Detailed sectoral growth data for 2021 Q4 portrays that economic activity was supported by the robust positive contribution of tourism, non-petroleum manufacturing and trad. The witnessed softening in economic growth is attributable to several factors most notably the impact of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, as well as the diminishing of the positive base effect observed during the previous three quarter. Leading indicators for 2022 Q2 point towards normalized economic activity, as the strong positive base effect diminishe. Going forward, economic activity is expected to expand at a slower than projected pac. This is mainly a result of the unfavorable spillovers emanating from the Russo- Ukrainian conflic. Regarding the labor market, the unemployment rate declined in 2022 Q1, registering 72 percen. The witnessed decline stemmed from the increase in employment figures which more than offset the increase in the labor forc. Annual headline urban inflation continued to increase, but at a slower pace, to record 135 percent in May 2022, from 131 percent in the previous mont. In addition, annual core inflation  which excludes volatile food and regulated items  witnessed also a slower pace of increase for the second consecutive mont. It continued its upward trend to record 133 percent in May 2022 from 119 percent in the previous mont. The increase in annual headline inflation was attributed to non-food items, since food items' annual inflation decelerated for the first time since the beginning of the year supported by the reversal of the supply shock witnessed in previous months in some fresh vegetable. May 2022 inflation reading continued to be affected by the depreciation of the Egyptian Pound, as well as by the repercussions of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict on commoditie. The MPC treats the developments stemming from the Russo-Ukrainian conflict to be among the exogenous shocks that are outside the scope of monetary policy and yet may lead to transitory deviations from pre-announced target rate. Monetary policy tools are utilized to anchor inflation expectations, contain demand-side pressures and second-round effects emanating from supply shocks that may lead to deviations from inflation target. Therefore in accommodation of the first- round effects of supply shocks, the elevated annual headline inflation rate will be temporarily tolerated relative to the CBE's pre-announced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4, before declining thereafte. In its decision to maintain policy rates unchanged today, the MPC takes note of its policy rate hikes in the previous two meetings and will continue to assess their impact on inflation expectations and other macroeconomic developments over the medium ter. Achieving low and stable inflation over the medium term is a requisite condition to achieve high and sustainable growth rates, as well as supporting real income. The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations, rather than of prevailing inflation rates and as such, will not hesitate to adjust its stance to achieve its price stability mandat.

Mexico,2022-06-23,"Available indicators suggest that global economic activity slowed down during the second quarter of 2022. World inflation continued increasing, in some cases reaching levels unseen in decades, as a result of pressures originated by the persistent bottlenecks in production, the recovery of demand, and the high levels of food and energy prices. This environment continues generating expectations of a faster withdrawal of monetary stimulus worldwide. Financial conditions tightened further, with an increase in interest rates and a stronger US dollar, in a context of risk aversion. In its latest monetary policy decision, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points and anticipated future adjustments. Similarly, a large number of other central banks have continued raising their reference rates. Among key global risks are those associated with the pandemic, inflationary pressures lasting longer, the intensification of geopolitical turmoil, and greater adjustments in economic, monetary and financial conditions. In domestic financial markets, the peso behaved orderly, while short- and long-term term interest rates increased. Economic activity is expected to continue recovering gradually during the second quarter of 2022. Nevertheless, an environment of uncertainty prevails, with slack conditions that are foreseen to continue decreasing gradually. In addition to the inflationary shocks stemming from the pandemic, there are pressures associated with the geopolitical conflict and the strict lockdown measures imposed by China. Thus, in the first half of June, headline and core inflation registered annual variations of 7.88% and 7.47%, respectively, remaining at elevated levels unseen in two decades. Their expectations for 2022 and 2023 increased significantly once again. Medium- and long-term expectations for headline inflation were revised slightly upwards and those for core inflation remained stable, although at levels above the target. In view of greater-than-anticipated pressures on inflation, the forecast for headline inflation was revised upwards up to the third quarter of 2023, while that for core inflation was also adjusted to the upside for the entire horizon, although convergence to the 3% target in the first quarter of 2024 is maintained (see table). These projections are subject to risks. On the upside: persistence of core inflation at high levels; external inflationary pressures associated with the pandemic; greater pressures on agricultural and livestock product prices and on energy prices due to the ongoing geopolitical conflict; exchange rate depreciation; and cost-related pressures. On the downside: a decline in the intensity of the geopolitical conflict; a better functioning of supply chains; a greater-than-expected effect from the negative output gap; and a larger-than-anticipated effect from the Policy Program to Fight Inflation 1 and High Prices. The balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon is biased significantly to the upside. The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the risk of contamination of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and of the price formation process. It also considered the increasing challenges for monetary policy stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of significant uncertainty, and inflationary pressures associated with the geopolitical conflict and with the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China, as well as the possibility of greater effects on inflation. Based on these considerations, and with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate, on this occasion, by 75 basis points to 7.75%. With this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon. The Board will monitor thoroughly inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations. This, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times with the trajectory needed to facilitate the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets. For the next policy decisions, the Board intends to continue raising the reference rate and will evaluate taking the same forceful measures if conditions so require. 2/ Forecast starting May 2022.

Turkiye,2022-06-23,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 14 percent. The escalating geopolitical risks were adversely realized in the first half of the year and caused a weakening in the worldwide economic activity. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards. Increasing concern over global food security driven by trade restrictions, high course of commodity prices, the persistence of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly in food and energy, and high transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies increased due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks have increased their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. Level of capacity utilization and other leading indicators show that robust growth in the beginning of the year continues in the second quarter as well, with the support of external demand. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases with tourism-related improvements, risks on current account balance due to energy prices continue. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. Credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. The Committee will continue to implement the strengthened macroprudential policy set decisively and take additional measures when needed. Increase in inflation is driven by rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, temporary effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the decline in inflation owing to the base effect and the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Hungary,2022-06-28,"At its meeting on 28 June 2022, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 29 June 2022:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. The protracted Russia-Ukraine war has led to a general deterioration in the global economic outlook. Higher commodity and energy prices have caused significant increases in global inflation, which has been aggravated by ongoing supply disruptions. There has been a general deterioration in investor sentiment since the end of May. Risk appetite has been driven by news on the war, expectations for interest rate increases by the world's leading central banks, concerns caused by persistently high inflation, fears of recession and developments related to the coronavirus pandemic. Global prices of major commodities remain at high levels. In response to persistently high inflation, monetary conditions have been tightened further by the world's leading central banks as well as the region's central banks. In June, the Fed continued to raise its policy rate taking a larger step and started to reduce its balance sheet. The European Central Bank signalled that it would cease its asset purchase programme (APP) in July and would start raising its policy rate. In the CEE region, the Polish and Czech central banks raised their key policy rates by 75 basis points and 125 basis points, respectively. Hungarian economic growth has been slowing in response to the deterioration in external economic activity; however, annual dynamics remain buoyant. In April, industrial production and construction output continued to expand on an annual basis. The turnover of retail stores rose at a double-digit rate in April relative to a year earlier. The labour market continues to be tight and the unemployment rate remains low. The time profile and structure of domestic GDP growth have strongly shown a dual nature in 2022. The rate of economic growth is expected to slow in the second half of the year. Components of domestic demand, particularly household consumption, are expected to contribute to growth this year. By contrast, net exports are likely to hold down the expansion. Looking forward, however, consumption and investment dynamics are also expected to slow considerably, while net exports are expected to make a positive contribution to GDP growth again as external markets and supply chains recover. Despite the temporary slowdown, the investment rate is expected to stabilise at a high level of above 27 percent on the forecast horizon. In May 2022, annual inflation was 10.7 percent and core inflation stood at 12.2 percent. Food prices rose at a rate above 20 percent relative to the same period a year earlier. Repricings continued to be much greater than usual in May, with rises in food prices accounting for nearly a half of the increase. External effects continue to quickly feed through to consumer prices. The Government's measures affecting fuel and household energy prices are providing a significant cushion against the spillover of the increase in global commodity prices into domestic inflation. However, inflation expectations remain elevated. Rises in energy, commodity and food prices are likely to raise domestic inflation further on the cost side. Price dynamics are expected to peak during the autumn months and then to decline at a modest pace. The future course of price cap measures is expected to have a significant effect on the timing of the peak and the subsequent inflation path. Preventing second-round effects and anchoring inflation expectations are crucial in terms of achieving the inflation target. Inflation is expected to return to the central bank tolerance band at the end of 2023, as the first-round effects of war tensions abate, external inflationary effects moderate, the inflationary effects of the tax measures announced in June fade and as a result of the proactive central bank measures, and then to meet the 3 percent central bank target in the first half of 2024. The consumer price index is expected to be between 11.0 percent and 12.6 percent this year, between 6.8 percent and 9.2 percent in 2023, and to be in line with the inflation target from 2024. The measures announced by the Government and their implementation are expected to ensure that the fiscal objectives will be met this year and next. As a result of economic growth and declining deficit, the government debt-to-GDP ratio may fall from 76.6 percent at the end of the previous year to below 75 percent in 2022, followed by further declines of around 2.5 percentage points each year. The current account deficit is expected to temporarily rise further in 2022. The deterioration in the trade balance this year is likely to reflect the deterioration in the terms of trade due to high energy prices, the slowdown in external markets, and imports in connection with buoyant domestic demand. However, significant new export capacities have been built in recent years, and as a result, the external balance is expected to improve quickly as the global economic environment normalises. The economy's net lending position may return to positive territory at the end of the forecast horizon. Inflation risks have further intensified over the past quarter. Accordingly, compared to the March forecast, inflation path expected currently by the MNB has shifted upwards. Global inflation has risen to its highest level in a decade, which, coupled with money market volatility, poses a larger risk to the domestic inflation outlook. Due to the increased challenges, the Monetary Council considers it necessary to close the gap between the base rate and the one-week deposit rate. The Council continues the interest rate tightening cycle by taking a decisive step in order to anchor inflation expectations and mitigate second-round inflation risks. In addition, it assesses that it is warranted to increase the one-week deposit rate to the level of the base rate at the weekly tender following the interest rate decision. The MNB continues to stand ready to respond quickly and flexibly by setting the interest rate on the one-week deposit instrument if warranted by the rise in short-term risks in financial and commodity markets. According to today's decision of the Monetary Council, the central bank base rate was raised by 185 basis points to 7.75 percent. The overnight deposit rate was increased by 135 basis points to 7.25 percent, and the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates were increased by 135 basis points to 10.25 percent. The central bank will extend the use of the foreign exchange liquidity providing swap facility from July 2022 and will stand ready to use it within quarter as well. The step is aimed at ensuring that short-term rates in every sub-market, particularly in the swap market, and at all times develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. By maintaining an active presence in the market, the MNB enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, thereby supporting the achievement and maintenance of price stability. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the upside risks to inflation have strengthened further. The risk of persistently high commodity and energy prices points to a prolonged period of high external inflation. Furthermore, high inflation may persist if strong price and wage dynamics build into economic agents' expectations, resulting in second-round inflationary effects. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank started the cycle of interest rate hikes one year ago, first among the central banks in the European Union. The further rise in inflation and persistent inflation risks warrant the decisive continuation of the tightening cycle. The MNB continuously monitors developments in financial market risks as well and stands ready to intervene in a flexible manner using every instrument in its monetary policy toolkit, if necessary. Maintaining tighter monetary conditions for a longer period is warranted to manage increasing second-round inflation risks resulting from persistently negative supply effects. The Monetary Council will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes until the outlook for inflation stabilises around the central bank target in a sustainable manner and inflation risks become evenly balanced on the horizon of monetary policy."
Colombia,2022-06-30,"The decision to raise the benchmark interest rate to 7.5% was unanimous. The decision to raise the benchmark interest rate to 7.5% was unanimous, and was based on the following considerations. Headline annual inflation rate is still high, having reached 9.23% in April and 9.07% in May. At the same time, core inflation excluding food and regulated items went from 5.26% in April to 5.87% in May. Inflation expectations continued to rise and are well above the 3.0% target for the policy horizon. Economic growth surprised on the upside in the first quarter (8.2% vs. 7.2% expected by the technical staff), thanks to the build-up in domestic demand driven by household consumption. As of mid-June, the consumer portfolio was growing at an annual rate of 22.1%. The economic tracking indicator (ISE) showed an annual variation of 11.8% in April, which is higher than the anticipated 8.6%. On this basis, the technical staff revised its growth forecast for 2022 upward from 5.0% to 6.3%. The sustained recovery in GDP continues to favor the momentum in the job market, which has shown continued growth in employment. With figures up to May, employment registered an annual increase of 11% in terms of the national total and 10.5% for the 13 major cities. The current account in the balance of payments showed a 6.4% deficit as a share of quarterly GDP in the first quarter of the year, exceeding the deficit of 4.1% of GDP for the same period in the previous year. This excess of demand is happening in an environment where external financing is becoming more costly due to tighter international financial conditions. Today's decision is consistent with the strength of economic activity in recent quarters and will help to position monetary policy more quickly on a path that lowers inflation and converges with the target in the medium term. Going forward, the pace of changes in monetary policy will be data dependent. Fecha de publicacion."
Israel,2022-07-04,"Inflation in Israel is above the upper bound of the target range, at 4.1 percent over the past 12 months. With that, it remains significantly lower than in most advanced economies. One-year inflation expectations are above the upper bound of the target range. However, expectations for the second year derived from the capital market have returned to within the target range, and expectations from the third year onward have converged back to the midpoint of the range. Economic activity in Israel is continuing at a high level and the labor market remains tight. However, the possible slowdown in global economic activity in view of the effects ofthe war in Ukraine and the slowdown in manufacturing activity in China, as wellas the political uncertainty in Israel, may have a negative impact on economic activity. The labor market is in a full employment environment. Businesses in most industries continued to indicate a shortage of workers as a constraint on their current operations. The tight labor market is leading to some wage pressures in the business sector. Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel has weakened by 5.1 percent against the US dollar, by 2.9 percent against the euro, and by 3.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The Research Department revised its forecast. Its assessment is that GDP will grow by 5 percent in 2022 and by 3.5 percent in 2023. The inflation rate is expected to be 4.5 percent in 2022, and to decline to 2.4 percent in 2023. Home prices increased by 15.4 percent in the past 12 months, a significantly higher rate than in past years, but the sharp upward trend of annual price increases moderated slightly. In addition to the decision on the interest rate, the Bank of Israel announces an expansion of the spread around the Bank of Israel interest rate (the corridor) in the credit windowand in the deposit window to commercial banks from C 2B 10.1 percent to C 2B 10.5 percent. The Israeli economy is recording strong growth, accompanied by a tight labor market and an increase in the inflation environment. The Committee has therefore decided to continue the process of increasing the interest rate. The pace of raising the interest rate will be determined in accordance with activity data and the development of inflation, in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy goals. For the file figures accompanying this notice, click here. Economic activity in Israel is continuing at a high level, and the labor market remains tight and in a full employment environment. However, the continued moderation of global activity in view of the effects of the war in Ukraine and the slowdown in manufacturing activity in China, as well as political uncertainty in Israel, may weigh upon economic activity. In addition, the economy is in the midst of another COVID-19 wave, though it is not having any material effect on economic activity. Since the previous interest rate decision, the CPI increased by 0.6 percent in May, and inflation in the past 12 months is above the upper bound of the target range, at 4.1 percent (Figure 1). With that, inflation in Israel is significantly lower than in most of the advanced economies (Figure 28). Net of energy and fruits and vegetables, inflation is 3.6 percent, and with the further neutralization of the effects of taxation and regulation, it is 3.4 percent (Figure 2). The annual pace of inflation, in both the nontradable and the tradable components, continued to increase (Figure 3). Inflation expectations for the coming year from the various sources are above the upper bound of the target range (Figure 4). However, expectations derived from the capital market for the second year returned to within the target range, and expectations from the third year onward converged back to the midpoint of the target range (Figure 5). Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel has weakened by 5.1 percent against the US dollar, by 2.9 percent against the euro, and by 3.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate (Figure 6). Indicators of economic activity continue to point to strong activity. The aggregatebalance of the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey increased in May, continuing to reflect businesses' positive assessments of their situation (Figure 13). In view of the continuing global production and supply chain difficulties, the magnitude of the equipment and raw materials constraint reported by companies remained significant, although there are indications of a moderation of the pressure on the supply chains (Figure 17). Total credit card purchases remained high in May. Goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds) remain higher than before the pandemic, and services exports remain very high (Figure 14). Goods imports are also high in all components (Figure 15).  The labor market is tight. While the unemployment rate did increase to 3.5 percent, it did so against the background of an increase in the participation and employment rates (Figure 20). The employment rate (aged 15+) increased to 61 percent: similar to the average employment rate in 2019. Alongside this, the employment rate in the prime working ages (25-64) is above the 2019 average. The number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate stabilized in May, but remained very high. Businesses inmost industries continue to indicate a shortage of workers as a constraint on their current operations (Figure 23). The tight labor market is leading to some wage pressures in the business sector, mainly in industries that generally feature high wages and professional employees (Figure 22). Wages in the public sector are increasing more moderately and at rates lower than the trend. The Bank of Israel Research Department revised its staff forecast.[1] In its assessment. GDP will grow by 5 percent in 2022, and by 3.5 percent in 2023, 0.5 percentage points lower than the previous forecast for each year (Figure 12). Despite the decline in the forecast figures, the level of activity derived from the forecast remains strong. The adjusted unemployment rate among the prime working ages (25-64) is expected to be 3.5 percent at the end of 2023. In addition, the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be about 66 percent in 2022 and about 64 percent 2023. Home prices increased by 15.4 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 9), a significantly higher pace than in previous years, but the sharp upward trend moderated slightly. There were sharp increases in building starts and building permits in the first quarter. In contrast, building completions remain low despite a slight increase in the most recent data. The volume of new mortgages taken out in May was about NIS 12 billion, representing a further increase in the pace of new mortgage borrowing (Figure 10). Alongside these, the annual increase in rents remained relatively moderate, at 3.4 percent. In the domestic capital market there were declines in the equity indices, but they were more moderate than in global markets. Yields on long-term government bonds increased at the beginning of the reviewed period, and declined sharply at the end ofthe period, back to their previous environment (Figure 7). Corporate bond spreads declined, contrary to the worldwide trend. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, financing constraints among businesses remained relatively low in all sectors. Globally, high inflation, monetary tightening, and the difficulties in the production chain continue to weigh upon growth in the advanced economies. Alongside the war in Ukraine and China's policy response to the increase in COVID-19 morbidity, these have further increased global economic uncertainty. In view of this, investment houses have revised their global growth forecasts downward (Figure 24). The volumeof world trade has been high in recent months, but moderated slightly in April, and based on leading indicators, it is expected to moderate further. The global purchasing managers' index of advanced economies remained virtually unchanged in May, and continues to indicate expansion of economic activity. In contrast, the index for the emerging markets indicates moderation (Figure 25). There were significant declines in equity and commodity indices, with a high level of volatility in view of the increased uncertainty and of economic and geopolitical events around the world (Figure 33). Commodity prices showed a mixed trend. Oil prices were volatile in view of the sanctions between Europe and Russia, while the prices of metals and agricultural commodities declined (Figure 31). Government bond markets were very volatile in view of the increase in inflation and expectations of a tighter monetary policy on the part of central banks. The global inflation environment continued to increase. In most countries, the inflation indices are significantly higher than the central bank targets. Monetary tightening around the world therefore continues. In the US, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 75 basis points. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve's interest rate forecast for the end of 2022 was increased sharply to 3.4 percent. In the eurozone, the European Central Bank left its interest rate unchanged, but announced that the conditions are ripe for an increase of 25 basis points in July, and for additional increases thereafter. In parallel, the ECB's government bond purchasing program ended at the end of June, and market forecasts for the interest rate at the end of the year increased to 0.8 percent during the surveyed period. In a number of other countries where inflation is above the central bank target, there were increases in the interest rates (Figure 30). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on July 18, 2022. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. August 22, 2022. [1] The full staff forecast is being published separately. The labor market is tight. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday.

Malaysia,2022-07-06,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to increase the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly increased to 2.50 percent and 2.00 percent, respectively. The reopening of the global economy and the improvement in labour market conditions continue to support the recovery of economic activity. However, these have been partly offset by the impact from rising cost pressures, the military conflict in Ukraine and strict containment measures in China. Inflationary pressures have continued to increase mainly due to elevated commodity prices and strong demand conditions, despite some easing in global supply chain conditions. Consequently, central banks are expected to continue adjusting their monetary policy settings, some at a faster pace, to reduce inflationary pressures. Going forward, the pace of global growth is expected to moderate, and will continue to be affected by the elevated cost pressures, conflict in Ukraine, global supply chain conditions, and financial market volatility. For the Malaysian economy, economic activity continued to strengthen in recent months. Exports and retail spending indicators affirm the positive growth momentum, supported by the transition to endemicity. In the labour market, the unemployment rate declined further, with higher labour participation and improving income prospects. Looking ahead, while external demand is expected to moderate, weighed by headwinds to global growth, economic growth will be supported by firm domestic demand. Additionally, the reopening of international borders since 1 April 2022 would facilitate the recovery in tourism-related sectors. Investment activity and prospects continue to be supported by the realisation of multi-year projects. However, downside risks to growth continue to stem from a weaker-than-expected global growth, further escalation of geopolitical conflicts, and worsening supply chain disruptions. Year-to-date, headline inflation has averaged 2.4%. While it is projected to remain within the 2.2% - 3.2% forecast range for the year, headline inflation may be higher in some months due mainly to the base effect from electricity prices. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to average between 2.0% - 3.0% in 2022 as demand continues to improve amid the high-cost environment. Nevertheless, the extent of upward pressures on inflation will remain partly contained by existing price controls, fuel subsidies and the continued spare capacity in the economy. The inflation outlook continues to be subject to global commodity price developments, arising mainly from the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and prolonged supply-related disruptions, as well as domestic policy measures. Amid the positive growth prospects for the Malaysian economy, the MPC decided to further adjust the degree of monetary accommodation. This is consistent with the MPC's view that the unprecedented conditions that necessitated a historically low OPR have continued to recede. At the current OPR level, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic growth. The MPC will continue to assess evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook to domestic inflation and growth. Any adjustments to the monetary policy settings going forward would be done in a measured and gradual manner, ensuring that monetary policy remains accommodative to support a sustainable economic growth in an environment of price stability. Bank Negara Malaysia 06 July 2022."
Romania,2022-07-06,"In its meeting of 6 July 2022, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual inflation rate increased faster than expected in the first two months of 2022 Q2, jumping in April to 13.76 percent from 10.15 percent in March and rising moderately in May to 14.49 percent. Most of the increase came again from exogenous CPI components, especially from the hefty and larger-than-anticipated hikes in electricity and natural gas prices  given the changes made to the price capping schemes in April  and, to a small extent, from the pick-up in fuel prices, following the advance in crude oil prices amid the war in Ukraine and the related sanctions. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate rose more steeply in the first month of Q2, also compared to forecasts, with its upward trend however softening subsequently, and reached 9.1 percent in May, from 7.1 percent in March, particularly under the influence of new significant increases in processed food prices. Specifically, the evolution of this component continues to reflect the effects of the surges in commodity prices, mainly agri-food prices, and of elevated energy and transport costs, alongside the influences of production chain bottlenecks, compounded by high short-term inflation expectations, the resilience of demand in certain segments, as well as by the significant share of food items and imported goods in the CPI basket. Therefore, the step-up in annual inflation rate in the first months of Q2 was further driven by global supply-side shocks, amplified by the war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed, which triggered and fuelled the strong rise in inflation worldwide, to unprecedented levels over the last decades in developed economies, including in many European countries. Average annual CPI inflation rate and average annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP  inflation indicator for EU Member States) went up to 8.3 percent and 7.1 percent respectively in May, from 6.5 percent and 5.6 percent respectively in March 2022. Economic activity stepped up in 2022 Q1 at a stronger-than-foreseen pace, adding 5.2 percent against 2021 Q4, when it grew by 1.0 percent quarter on quarter. This renders likely a visibly higher-than-expected resurgence in positive output gap in this period, albeit relatively moderate. In 2022 Q1, annual GDP dynamics advanced to 6.5 percent from 2.4 percent in 2021 Q4, significantly above expectations. However, behind the strengthening in GDP growth rate stood mainly the change in inventories, while the contribution of private consumption  coming second in terms of size  owed to some sub-components other than purchases of goods and services, which reported a markedly lower increase in annual terms during this quarter, inter alia amid a base effect. A notable contribution was also made by gross fixed capital formation, as a result of the strong re-acceleration against the same year-earlier period of both net investment in equipment (transport equipment included) and new construction works. At the same time, during this quarter, net exports no longer made a negative contribution to annual GDP dynamics, as the increase in the annual change in the export volume of goods and services outpaced that in the import volume. However, the annual increase in the negative trade balance re-accelerated, primarily amid the relatively more unfavourable developments in import prices, while the current account deficit saw a considerably faster deepening trend against the same period of the previous year, inter alia as a result of the strong worsening in the dynamics of the primary income balance, on account of outflows of reinvested earnings and distributed dividends. The recent developments in high-frequency indicators point to a quasi-standstill of economic activity in Q2, under the impact of the war in Ukraine and the associated sanctions, which implies a marked decline in the annual GDP growth rate during this period. Thus, the data for April 2022 show a deceleration in the annual growth of retail trade and motor vehicle and motorcycle trade, as well as a larger contraction in annual terms in the industrial output, concurrently with the notable slowdown in the dynamics of new manufacturing orders. Moreover, in April, the volume of construction works recorded a significant drop from the same year-earlier period, mainly owing to developments in the residential and non-residential segments, but also following the steeper fall in civil engineering works. However, the number of employees in the economy continued to grow in March-April, at an even somewhat swifter monthly pace that was almost entirely ascribable to hiring in the private sector, and the ILO unemployment rate declined gradually over the last months to 5.4 percent in May, yet remaining visibly above pre-pandemic values. Furthermore, the labour shortage reported by companies posted a faster rise in Q2, tending to near the levels prevailing prior to the pandemic, while the hiring intentions for the near-term horizon increased, but in the context of mixed sectoral developments, probably explained mostly by the effects and uncertainties generated by the war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed. Looking at the financial market, the main interbank money market rates have risen at a faster pace in the recent period, prompted by the monetary policy rate hike in May and the central bank's firm control over market liquidity, but also amid expectations on an increase in the key rate, strengthened by the NBR's messages and the decisions of central banks in the region. In turn, yields on government securities steepened their upward path, especially for the short and medium maturities. This occurred, inter alia, in the context of a brief sell-off episode on bond markets, entailed by expectations on a faster normalisation of the monetary policy conduct by the Fed and the ECB, as well as amid the further deterioration of financial investor sentiment vis-à-vis some markets in the region. At the same time, the average remuneration of new time deposits grew at a considerably swifter tempo in April and May, even in the case of households. At this juncture, the EUR/RON exchange rate remained relatively stable in May and June as well. The double-digit annual growth rate of credit to the private sector stepped up further in the first months of Q2, reaching 16.5 percent in May and 16.16 percent during the period overall, as the particularly strong dynamics of the leu-denominated component remained relatively steady and were accompanied by a renewed pick-up in the pace of increase of forex loans. The share of leu-denominated loans in credit to the private sector thus remained unchanged at 72.7 percent. According to current assessments, the annual inflation rate will stick to an upward path until mid-Q3, under the impact of supply-side shocks, yet at a visibly slower pace, thus climbing moderately above the values forecasted in May over the short time horizon. Behind the worsening of the near-term inflation outlook stand the higher dynamics anticipated over the following months for the prices of fuels, natural gas and electricity  even amid the support schemes in place and some base effects , as well as for processed food prices. This is mainly ascribable to the stronger advance in crude oil, energy and agri-food commodity prices, owing to the war in Ukraine and the associated sanctions. Additional inflationary effects are also expected from administered prices, inter alia as a result of the National Railway Company raising ticket prices, as well as from tobacco product prices, following the increase in the specific excise duty. Uncertainties are, nevertheless, associated with the presumed impact, but also the duration of energy and fuel price capping and compensation schemes. Moreover, notable risks continue to come from developments in energy commodity prices, as well as from the persistence of bottlenecks in production and supply chains, amid the war in Ukraine and the related sanctions, to which add those stemming from the recently announced measures for increasing budget revenues. The protraction of the war in Ukraine and the expansion of sanctions against Russia generate, however, considerable uncertainties and risks to the outlook for economic activity, hence to medium-term inflation developments, through the possibly stronger effects exerted, via multiple channels, on consumer purchasing power and confidence, as well as on firms' activity, profits and investment plans, but also by potentially affecting more severely the European/global economy and the risk perception towards economies in the region, with an unfavourable impact on financing costs. The absorption of EU funds, especially those under the Next Generation EU programme, is conditional on fulfilling strict milestones and targets for implementing the approved projects. However, it is essential for carrying out the necessary structural reforms, energy transition included, but also for counterbalancing, at least in part, the contractionary impact of supply-side shocks, compounded by the war in Ukraine and the related sanctions, as well as the effects of fiscal consolidation. It is vital to reap the full benefits of these resources. Rising uncertainties and risks are also associated, however, with the fiscal policy stance, given the requirement for further budget consolidation amid the excessive deficit procedure and the overall tightening trend of financing conditions, yet in a challenging economic and social environment domestically and globally, which led to the implementation of several packages of measures to support households and firms, with potential adverse implications for budget parameters. Particularly relevant are also the ECB's and the Fed's prospective monetary policy stances, as well as the size and pace of increase of key rates by central banks in Czechia. Poland and Hungary. In the meeting held today, 6 July 2022, based on the currently available data and assessments, as well as in light of the very elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 4.75 percent per annum from 3.75 percent per annum as of 7 July 2022. Moreover, it decided to raise the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 5.75 percent per annum from 4.75 percent per annum and the deposit facility rate to 3.75 percent per annum from 2.75 percent per annum, as well as to maintain firm control over money market liquidity. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to keep the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to anchor inflation expectations over the medium term, as well as to foster saving through higher bank rates, so as to bring back the annual inflation rate in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat target on a lasting basis, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The NBR closely monitors developments in the domestic and international environment and will continue to use the tools at its disposal to achieve the fundamental objective of price stability in the medium term. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 18 July 2022 at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board will be held on 5 August 2022, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Peru,2022-07-07,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT JULY 2022 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 6.00% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 50 bps to 6.00 percent, thus continuing to normalize its monetary policy stance. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation increased from 8.09 percent in May to 8.81 percent in June, above the target range, due to significant increases in international food and fuel prices. Year-on-year core inflation also rose from 4.26 percent in May to 4.95 percent in June, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The significant and continuous increase in international energy and food prices since the second half of last year, accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in global inflation in magnitudes not seen in many years and towards levels significantly higher than the inflation targets of central banks, both in advanced and other economies in the region. Thus, inflation is expected to return to the target range between the second and the third quarter of next year. The downward path of year-on-year inflation is expected to begin in July of this year, , due to the moderation of the effects of international food and energy prices and an economy still below potential. One-year-ahead expected inflation increased from 4.89 to 5.35 percent between May and June, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most leading indicators and expectations for economic activity deteriorated in June and remain pessimistic. Global economic activity is improving at a slower pace due to the persistent bottlenecks in the global supply of goods and services, the reversal of monetary stimulus in advanced economies, the confinement measures in China, and international conflicts. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants, including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, with an aim to consider changes in the monetary stance so that inflation returns to the target range over the forecast horizon. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 4.00 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 6.50 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months and the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months. In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates based on the amount of the operations. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on August 11, 2022."
Poland,2022-07-07,"Warsaw, 7 July 2022 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 7 July 2022 The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.50 percentage points, i.e. to 6.50%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: ▪ lombard rate at 7.00%; ▪ deposit rate at 6.00%; ▪ rediscount rate at 6.55%; ▪ discount rate at 6.60%. In 2021 Q2, economic conditions in the largest advanced economies were relatively favourable. At the same time, however, in some emerging market economies, including China, the pace of activity growth deteriorated markedly. Recently, signals of notable worsening of the global growth outlook have intensified. Activity in the global economy and its prospects are under the negative impact of high prices of commodities and of production components, persisting disruptions in the functioning of global supply chains and the repercussions of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine. Global inflation continues to rise, reaching in many economies the highest levels in decades. At the same time, inflation forecasts for the coming quarters are being still revised upwards. The main source of growing inflation continue to be high commodity prices as well as prolonged disruptions in global supply chains and international transport, amplified by the effects of war. In some economies, rising prices are also driven by high demand growth and increasing labour costs. As a consequence, core inflation is also increasing. Amidst a strong increase in inflation, many central banks have been tightening their monetary policy in the recent period. The US Federal Reserve increased interest rates. In turn, the ECB concluded net asset purchases. Central banks in many economies, including in the Central-Eastern Europe region, continued to increase interest rates. In Poland, available monthly data indicate that economic conditions remained favourable in 2022 Q2, however, economic activity growth decelerated. This is accompanied by the lowest unemployment rate on record and a marked rise in wages. A further slowdown of 1/3 economic growth is forecast for the coming quarters, while both the domestic and global economic outlook is subject to significant uncertainty. Inflation in Poland  according to Statistics Poland flash estimate  increased in June 2022 to 15.6% y/y. High inflation results mainly from an earlier strong rise in global energy and agricultural commodity prices  driven, to a large extent, by the repercussions of Russian military aggression against Ukraine  and earlier increases in regulated tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy. Consequences of disruptions in global supply chains and high shipping costs in international trade also boost inflation. At the same time, continued robust demand which enables enterprises to pass rising costs on to the final prices has had also a positive contribution to the price growth in Poland. In turn, a curbing impact on inflation has been exerted by a reduction in some tax rates as part of the Anti- inflationary Shield. In the coming quarters, it is expected that the impact of factors currently amplifying price growth will persist, including those related to the Russian military aggression against Ukraine. Meanwhile, the NBP interest rates increases, together with fading of the impact of shocks currently boosting prices will contribute to a gradual decline in inflation in the coming years. The decrease in inflation would also be supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council's assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy. The Council became acquainted with the results of the July projection of inflation and GDP based on the NECMOD model. In line with the projection prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 22 June 2022, there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of 13.215.4% in 2022 (against 9.312.2% in the March 2022 projection), 9.8-15.1% in 2023 (compared to 7.0-11.0%) and 2.2-6.0% in 2024 (compared to 2.85.7%). At the same time, the annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 3.9-5.5% in 2022 (against 3.45.3% in the March 2022 projection), 0.2-2.3% in 2023 (compared to 1.9-4.1%) and 1.0-3.5 % in 2024 (compared to 1.44.0%). The Council assessed, that there persists a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. In order to reduce this risk, i.e. striving to decrease inflation to the NBP target in the medium term, the Council decided to increase NBP interest rates again. The increase of the NBP interest rates will also curb inflation expectations. 2/3 Further decisions of the Council will depend on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy. NBP will take all necessary actions in order to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability, including above all to reduce the risk of inflation remaining elevated. NBP may intervene in the foreign exchange market, in particular to limit fluctuations of the zloty exchange rate that are inconsistent with the direction of monetary policy. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  July 2022."
Thailand,2022-07-07,"Outcome of the Joint Meeting between the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 4 July 2022 The Bank of Thailand (BOT) announced the outcome of the joint meeting between the MPC and the FIPC on 4 July 2022, to assess risks to Thailand's financial stability. Key discussion points were as follows. The committees conclude that Thailand's financial system is resilient. Domestic financial markets continue to function normally despite higher volatility stemming from the global financial markets. Commercial banks hold ample levels of capital and loan loss provisions, and are capable of extending liquidity to support continued economic recovery. Securities companies and insurance companies as a whole are financially robust. Although some non-life insurance firms were impacted by claims of COVID-19 insurance coverage, the situation has improved as most COVID-19 insurance policies have expired and stringent supervisory measures have been put in place. In addition, macro stress tests indicate that the Thai financial system possesses sufficient liquidity and strong financial position to withstand shocks under stress scenarios, both in the event of economic contraction as a result of a new wave of virus outbreak and energy crisis, as well as in the event of sluggish economic recovery. To complement the macro stress tests, the BOT, the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Office of Insurance Commission (OIC) have also carried out reverse stress tests to assess potential scenarios that could significantly impair the soundness of financial institutions and capital markets, and stability of the financial system, as well as to identify key risk drivers and thresholds as an additional tool for risk monitoring and preventive policy consideration. The results show that the current levels of key risk drivers remain distant from those that would trigger serious problems for banks, mutual funds, securities companies and insurance companies. Moreover the likelihood of events that would seriously affect the performance of these financial intermediaries is quite low. In the period ahead, the Thai economy is expected to continue to recover as COVID-19 containment measures and international travel restrictions have been lifted. However the progress of recovery faces a number of challenges including the prospect of a global economic slowdown, rising costs of living and raw materials as a result of geopolitical conflicts, and financial market volatility arising from uncertainty over the pace of monetary policy tightening in advanced economies and economic concerns in emerging markets. Given this outlook, the committees have comprehensively assessed risks to different sectors within the financial system, with emphasis on liquidity and debt serviceability problems of households and businesses due to rising cost of living and input costs, as well as implications of the expected rises in the policy interest rate to anchor inflation expectations on households, corporates, banks, securities businesses, and insurance companies and risk build-up as a result of search-for-yield behavior in the context of persistently negative real policy interest rate. These risks could potentially undermine financial stability going forward and, therefore, should be closely monitored. In view of the above, regulatory authorities have been proactively preparing policy instruments and enhancing supervisory standards to better address risks in various dimensions. For instance, authorities have implemented targeted measures to address debt serviceability risk of vulnerable borrowers, improved regulations to increase the effectiveness of liquidity management tools for mutual funds, and initiatives to comprehensively strengthen the corporate bond market ecosystem and regulatory supervision of insurance firms. Looking ahead, the BOT, the SEC, and the OIC will continue to collaborate closely in monitoring and assessing risks. The regulators will stand ready to coordinate policies and to impose additional targeted measures, if necessary, to ensure continuous recovery of the real economy and mitigate risks to the Thai financial system going forward."
Hungary,2022-07-12,"At its meeting on 12 July 2022, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 13 July 2022:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Upside risks to inflation have strengthened further since the June interest rate decision, while the risk of second-round inflationary effects has increased. The situation in financial markets has recently increased the risk of persistent inflationary effects, posing a clear threat to price stability. The effects of unfavourable financial market developments and persistently high commodity and energy prices point to a prolonged period of high external inflation. Furthermore, high inflation may persist if strong price dynamics feed into economic agents' expectations, making it more difficult to ensure price stability. To manage risks, the MNB raised the one-week deposit rate by 200 basis points on 7 July 2022. Consistent with its strategy formulated in June, the Monetary Council considers it necessary that the rise in the one-week deposit rate should be incorporated into the base-rate tightening cycle as soon as possible. Due to the increased challenges, in order to anchor inflation expectations and mitigate second-round inflation risks, it is warranted to raise the base rate to the level of the one-week deposit interest rate. The MNB continues to stand ready to respond quickly and flexibly by setting the interest rate on the one-week deposit instrument if warranted by the rise in short-term risks in financial and commodity markets. According to today's decision of the Monetary Council, the central bank base rate was raised by 200 basis points to 9.75 percent. The overnight deposit rate was increased by 200 basis points to 9.25 percent, and the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates were increased by 200 basis points to 12.25 percent. The Bank considers it crucial that short-term rates in every sub-market, particularly in the swap market, and at all times develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. To that end, on 8 July 2022, the MNB started the use of swap tenders providing foreign currency liquidity within quarters with an overnight maturity. By maintaining an active presence in the market, the MNB enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, thereby supporting the achievement and maintenance of price stability. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank started the cycle of interest rate hikes one year ago, first among the central banks in the European Union. The further rise in inflation and persistent inflation risks warrant the decisive continuation of the tightening cycle. The MNB continuously monitors developments in financial market risks as well and stands ready to intervene in a decisive manner using every instrument in its monetary policy toolkit, if necessary. Maintaining tighter monetary conditions for a longer period is warranted to manage increasing second-round inflation risks resulting from persistently negative supply effects. The Monetary Council will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes until the outlook for inflation stabilises around the central bank target in a sustainable manner and inflation risks become evenly balanced on the horizon of monetary policy."
Chile,2022-07-13,"NoPtrae sdse R eplereasnes*a Wednesday, 13 July 2022 Monetary Policy Meeting  July 2022 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 75 basis points to 9.75%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of all the Board members. Global inflation has continued to rise, and central banks have further raised their benchmark rates, or have signaled a more rapid increase in the face of more persistent inflation. Notably, the U.S. Federal Reserve surprised with a bigger‐than‐expected increase and has announced that rate hikes will continue until inflation is brought under control. Financial conditions have tightened for both developed and emerging economies, with stock market declines and a global appreciation of the dollar. The market outlook for global growth has deteriorated, moving closer to the projections included in the last MP Report. Meanwhile, commodity prices have fallen more than expected, mainly due to fears of a global recession. The fall in food prices stands out, where there has also been some favorable news from the supply side. The copper price has dropped significantly, to around US$3.3 per pound at this Meeting (somewhat more than 20% since the last Meeting). In any case. Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to be a source of risk for the external scenario, exerting pressure on the prices of some commodities, especially foods and energy. Summing up, the international scenario has worsened with respect to the forecasts included in the June Report. The domestic financial market has performed in line with global trends and in a context of high local uncertainty. The IPSA has accumulated losses (5% since the last Meeting), with 10‐year interest rates at similar levels to those at the June Meeting. The exchange rate has depreciated sharply (a little more than +20% since the last Meeting), with high volatility. To date, markets have been able to properly absorb shocks, and volatility in the foreign exchange market has not been transmitted to other segments of the financial system, which have operated with adequate levels of liquidity. Local bank credit continues to be weak, amid still tight financing conditions. Activity has continued with a gradual decline, as expected. The May Imacec posted a 6.4% annual increase —with a smaller than anticipated fall in mining—, while the seasonally‐adjusted non‐mining Imacec dropped 0.9% month‐on‐month, close to projections. Indicators related to private consumption and investment have performed in line with projections, with the former remaining resilient and the latter weakening. In the labor market, employment growth has continued to slow down, and job vacancies are declining. The annual change in real wages remains negative. Consumer and business confidence indicators are in negative territory. Headline inflation is still on the rise and hit 12.5% annually in June, while its core component rose to 9.9% annually. The latest inflation numbers have practically matched the forecasts in the June Report, with surprises focusing on specific products, mostly volatile ones. Inflation expectations derived from our surveys —the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) and the Financial Traders Survey (EOF)— have been adjusted upward. The macroeconomic scenario presents considerable risks. Global financial conditions have deteriorated more rapidly and intensely than anticipated, bringing down commodity prices and market expectations of global growth. Amid high uncertainty at home, this has triggered a sharp depreciation of the peso. In the short run, these developments will cause further increases in local prices, in a context where inflation and its persistence are already high. The Board estimates that new increases in the MPR will be necessary to ensure the convergence of inflation Nota de prensa to 3% in two years. The magnitude of said increases will hinge on the implications of the evolution of the scenario for the achievement of the inflation target, a situation that will be analyzed in the next Monetary Policy Report in September. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be released at 8:30 hours of Thursday 28 July 2022. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will be held on Tuesday 6 September and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours the same day. The Spanish original prevails.

South Korea,2022-07-13,"The bank of korea. Monetary Policy Decision. (Statement). The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 50 basis points, from 1.75% to 2.25%. The Board judges that a pre-emptive policy response to prevent the entrenchment of high inflation is of greater importance for some time as high inflation is continuing and becoming broad-based while short-term inflation expectations are rising sharply, although economic downside risks have increased at home and abroad. Currently available information suggests that global economic growth has weakened, affected by the prolonged Ukraine crisis, while inflation has remained high. In global financial markets, risk aversion has strengthened due to the acceleration of policy rate hikes in major countries and consequent concerns about economic slowdown. The US dollar has remained strong and stock prices have fallen considerably, while government bond yields in major countries have fluctuated significantly. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by global inflation movements, monetary policy changes in major countries, geopolitical risks, and COVID-19 restrictions in major countries. The Korean economy has continued to recover. Private consumption has sustained its improvement and sluggishness in facilities investment has eased, while export growth has somewhat slowed. Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed remaining high. Going forward, while private consumption is likely to sustain its recovery. GDP growth this year is projected to be somewhat below the May forecast of 2.7%, affected by the slowdown in exports owing to weakening of economic growth in major countries. Uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook are judged to be elevated. Consumer price inflation has risen significantly to 6.0% due to the ongoing sharp rise in the prices of petroleum products and the accelerating price increases in other expenditure categories. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) and the inflation expectations of the general public have increased to close to 4%. It is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain high at above 6% for some time and run substantially above the May forecast of 4.5% for the year overall. Core inflation is forecast to remain elevated at 4% or higher for a considerable time. In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates have risen considerably, due to expectations about policy rate hikes at home and abroad, while stock prices have fallen sharply driven mainly by concerns about global economic slowdown. The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has risen significantly, reflecting the global strengthening of the US dollar. Household loans have increased slightly and housing prices have remained steady. Considering inflation and economic conditions, though economic downside risk is indeed high, uncertainties remain elevated, and thus the Board sees it as important at this time to curb the spread of inflation expectations through a 50-basis-point rate hike to prevent acceleration of inflation. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon as it monitors economic growth, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board sees continued rate hikes as warranted, as inflation is expected to run above the target level for a considerable time. In this process the Board will determine the size and pace of further increase of the Base Rate while thoroughly assessing the trends of growth and inflation, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, monetary policy changes in major countries, and external economic conditions including geopolitical risks. Opening Remarks to the Press Conference. The Monetary Policy Board (MPB) of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 50 basis points, from 1.75% to 2.25%. First of all. I would like to tell you that the decision was made with a sense of grave responsibility, since this was the first 50-basis-point rate hike in the Bank's history, although rate cuts of more than 50 basis points had been made before. I will explain the background to the Base Rate hike in detail after touching upon global and domestic financial and economic conditions. First, looking at the changes in external conditions since the May MPB meeting, global economic growth has weakened and uncertainties as to the growth path have increased significantly, affected by the prolonged Ukraine crisis and the acceleration of policy rate hikes in major countries, while inflation has exceeded 8% in major countries including the US and those in the euro zone. As risk aversion in global financial markets has strengthened accordingly, the US dollar has remained strong and stock prices have fallen considerably while government bond yields in major countries have fluctuated significantly. Despite the worsening external conditions, the Korean economy continued to recover until the first half of this year as originally expected. Private consumption has improved led by face-to-face services industries, and sluggishness in facilities investment has partially eased, while export growth has somewhat slowed. However. GDP growth is projected to be below the May forecast, affected by the slowdown in exports owing to weakening of economic growth in major countries. Uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook are also judged to be elevated. Concerning inflation, consumer price inflation has risen to the 6% level for the first time since the Asian currency crisis in 1998. Inflation has not only risen significantly but is doing so at a faster pace. It took seven months for inflation to reach the 5% level from the 3% level, but it took only one month to rise from the 5% level to the 6% level. Furthermore, as demand-side pressures as well as supply-side factors have grown, inflation is becoming more broad-based, with 50% of the items composing the consumer price index showing price increases of 5% or higher. As a result, core inflation and the inflation expectations of the general public have increased to almost 4%. In domestic financial markets, volatility of major price variables has heightened greatly. Long-term market interest rates have risen considerably on the prospect of faster policy rate hikes at home and abroad, and stock prices have fallen sharply driven mainly by concerns about the global economic slowdown. The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has risen to above 1,300 won, reflecting the global strengthening of the US dollar and net outflows of stock investment funds by Korean nationals and foreigners. Looking at financial stability, household loans in the financial sector increased slightly in June, led by housing-related loans, despite declines in unsecured loans, and housing prices remained steady. Today, the Monetary Policy Board decided to raise the Base Rate by 50 basis points in consideration of the need for a preemptive policy response to ensure price stability. All MPB members supported the decision unanimously. As for a more detailed explanation of the background to the Base Rate hike, just as I mentioned earlier, consumer price inflation at the 6% level is already high, and inflation is getting more broad-based, thus causing negative real interest rates to widen significantly. In addition, there have been growing concerns that high inflation could become entrenched as inflation expectations have been spreading with short-term inflation expectations nearing 4% and wage growth accelerating, and the interaction between inflation and wages has strengthened. The Board thus judged that a policy response to this would be of great importance. Although global economic downside risks had increased, the Board judged that, particularly since there are high uncertainties associated with the Ukraine crisis and the pace of policy rate hikes in major economies, it would be desirable to respond to such risks after further examining external developments and their impacts on the domestic economy. The Bank of Korea sees it warranted to maintain its stance of Base Rate hikes going forward, as inflation is projected to remain high for some time. With regard to the pace of increase, given today's preemptive 50bp hike, we believe gradual, 25bp increases will be appropriate for some time, unless domestic prices deviate considerably from our current projection that inflation will gradually decline after running high for several months. However, let me make it clear that the timing and size of our policy response is subject to change if inflation accelerates due to shifts in domestic or overseas conditions, or if the economy slows to a larger extent than expected. We will closely monitor how the Korean financial and FX markets are impacted by currency depreciation and capital outflow pressures in EMEs and the consequent changes in international financial market conditions. The Board is well aware that today's 50bp rate hike could aggravate difficulties for the vulnerable sectors of our economy. However, if we fail to make a timely response now, resulting in the strengthening of the interaction between price and wage and the entrenchment of high inflation, a larger rate hike will be unavoidable later, which could weigh more heavily on the vulnerable sectors as well as the economy as a whole. As for the growing hardship faced by the vulnerable sectors, we will work hard to find targeted support measures in cooperation with the government. One such example is our plan to keep the interest rate at 0.25% for the loans provided to firms affected by COVID-19 under the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility, for a maximum of one year even after the program expires at the end of September 2022 as scheduled. The Bank of Korea will also work toward improving the household debt structure, by providing support for the conversion of households' floating-rate loans to fixed-rate ones."
Philippines,2022-07-13,"During this morning's regular meeting, the Monetary Board decided to raise the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility by 75 basis points to 3.25 percent, effective today, 14 July 2022. Accordingly, the interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were raised to 2.75 percent and 3.75 percent, respectively. In raising the policy interest rate anew, the Monetary Board recognized that a significant further tightening of monetary policy was warranted by signs of sustained and broadening price pressures amid the ongoing normalization of monetary policy settings. The Monetary Board noted that favorable conditions arising from the strong rebound in growth thus far in the year suggest that the domestic economy can accommodate a further tightening of monetary policy settings. By taking urgent action, the Monetary Board aims to anchor inflation expectations further and temper mounting risks to the inflation outlook. In particular, policy action is intended to help manage spillovers from other countries that could potentially disanchor inflation expectations. At the same time, the Monetary Board continues to urge timely non-monetary government interventions to mitigate the impact of persistent supply-side pressures on commodity prices. The BSP reassures the public of its unwavering commitment and readiness to take further necessary actions to steer inflation towards a target-consistent path over the medium term in keeping with its price stability mandate."
Nigeria,2022-07-19,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 143 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON MONDAY 18th AND TUESDAY 19th July 2022 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 18th and 19th of July 2022, confronted with heightened macroeconomic uncertainties, broad based inflation across countries, and weakening global recovery associated with the ongoing Russian-Ukraine war, as well as backlash from a wide range of sanctions imposed on Russia. The Committee reviewed developments in the global and domestic economies in the second quarter of 2022 and the outlook for the rest of the year. Majorly these developments include the unabated rise in global inflation, driven by the disruptions to the global supply chain; tightening global financial conditions as several advanced economies pursue an aggressive regime of monetary policy normalization; declining global trade; and growing risks to financial stability, associated with the burgeoning global private and public debt profile. Eleven (11) members of the Committee attended this meeting. Global Economic Developments The Committee noted with concern, the downtrend in global recovery, aggravated by supply chain disruptions as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the spillbacks and spillovers from sanctions imposed on Russia by the US and its allies. This has resulted in an unprecedented rise and widespread global inflation which is exacerbating downward pressure on the fragile recovery of the global economy. In addition, lingering headwinds associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are constraining the smooth functioning of the global supply chain. The rising risk of tightening global financial conditions, implies that developing economies now face the risk of constrained access to global capital which would further depress growth in this group of economies. This is expected to result in increased financial vulnerabilities due to the huge volume of corporate and public debt accumulated in the wake of the sharp downturn driven by the COVID-19 lockdown. In the light of these developments, the key risk confronting the global economy is that of a recession which may crystalize as second quarter growth figures for major advanced and developing economies begin to emerge. Consequently the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its April 2022 World Economic Outlook (WEO), downgraded its global output growth forecast for 2022 and 2023 to 36 per cent apiece from 44 and 38 per cent, respectively, with the likelihood of a further downgrade, given the continued deterioration in output growth. Inflation in several advanced economies pushed higher and further away from the long-run objectives of their central banks, reflecting the sustained increase in the price of food, energy, and other commodities due to the harsh combination of persisting supply chain disruptions and pent-up demand. In the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), inflation is also on the rise, compounded by legacy structural challenges as well as heightened exchange rate pressures, driven by rising capital flow reversals in addition to the outlined shocks from the global economy. In the financial markets, available data suggests that investors are now rebalancing their portfolios away from gold and equities to fixed income securities, to take advantage of rising yields in the advanced economies as major central banks progress with interest rate hike. Consequently the tightening of global financial conditions is expected to heighten investment and debt default risks, leading to the likelihood of a broad economic slowdown. Domestic Economic Developments According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 311 per cent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2022, compared with 398 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 051 per cent in the corresponding period of 2021. The economy has thus grown for six consecutive quarters, following its exit from recession in 2020. This consistent positive performance was driven largely by the continuous growth in the non- oil sector, specifically, in the services and agriculture subsectors; ongoing policy support post-COVID lockdown; and the base effect from the corresponding period. Staff projection showed that the economy is expected to remain on a path of sustained positive growth observed in the last few quarters. The Committee also noted that both the Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMIs) increased above the 50-index point benchmark to 511 and 503 index points in June 2022, compared with 489 and 499 index points, respectively, in May 2022. This reflects the continued rebound in economic activities due to improvements in supplier delivery time; raw materials inventory; employment levels as well as expansion in some sectors such as agriculture, accommodation, electricity, amongst others. The Committee noted with concern the persisting uptick in headline inflation (year-on-year) to 1860 per cent in June 2022 from 1771 per cent in May 2022, an 89-basis point increase in just one month. This continued increase in inflation was driven by increases in both the core and food components to 1575 and 2060 per cent in June 2022. The considerable rise in core inflation resulted largely from the rising cost of production due to high energy prices associated with the persistent disruptions to power supply, hike in electricity tariff, continued scarcity of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), and rising price of Automotive Gas Oil (AGO). The increase in the food component was, however, driven by shocks to food prices associated with continued insecurity in food producing areas and along major access routes across the country; the continued impact of the war in Ukraine on the supply of fertilizer inputs, wheat and other grains; exchange rate pressures; and the impact of monetary policy normalization on capital flows away from emerging markets. The Committee, however, expressed confidence in the Bank's sustained intervention programmes, noting that inflation is expected to abate as food supply improves and the fiscal authority sustain its efforts to tame the legacy structural challenges which put upward pressure on domestic price levels. Members therefore, urged the fiscal authority to expand and sustain its support for all the recently deployed stimuli to the real sector of the economy. The MPC noted that broad money supply (M3) rose significantly to 1152 per cent in June 2022, compared with 1086 per cent in May 2022. This was largely driven by the growth in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of 1802 per cent in June 2022, compared with 1737 per cent in the previous month. The sustained growth in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) was attributed to the increase in claims on the Federal Government and other sectors (public nonfinancial corporations, private sector, and state and local governments). Money market rates oscillated within the asymmetric corridor, reflecting prevailing liquidity conditions in the banking system. Consequently the monthly weighted average Open Buy Back (OBB) and Inter-bank Call rates increased in June 2022 to 1089 and 1110 per cent, from 939 and 838 per cent in May, respectively. The increase in both the Open Buy Back (OBB) and Inter-bank Call rates reflected the tight liquidity conditions in the banking system. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and the Liquidity Ratio (LR) both remained above their prudential limits at 141 and 426 per cent, respectively in June 2022. The Committee, noted the reduction in the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio to 495 per cent in June 2022, compared with 57 per cent in June 2021. The MPC, thus, urged the Bank to sustain its tight prudential regime to ensure that the NPLs ratio is brought well below its prudential benchmark. The MPC noted the very moderate decline in the performance of the equities market in the review period, as the All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalization (MC) moderated to 51,,81759 and N2794 trillion on June 30, 2022, from 52,,99078 and N2856 trillion on May 31, 2022, respectively. The market, however, remains resilient, reflecting continued confidence in the Nigerian economy, as both the monetary and fiscal authorities work assiduously to improve macroeconomic fundamentals in Nigeria. The Committee noted the marginal increase of 161 per cent in the level of external reserves to US$3922 billion at end-June 2022 from US$3860 billion at end-May 2022 due to the increase in inflows from non-oil sources. The Committee reviewed the performance of the Bank's intervention programmes targeted at stimulating productivity in agriculture, manufacturing/industries, energy/infrastructure, healthcare, exports and micro, small & medium enterprises (MSMEs). Between May and June 2022, under the Anchor Borrowers' Programme (ABP), the Bank released the sum of N362 billion, as disbursements to 12 projects for the cultivation of rice, wheat, and maize, bringing the cumulative disbursement under the Programme to N101 trillion, to over 421 million smallholder farmers cultivating 21 commodities across the country. The Bank also disbursed N372 billion to finance three large-scale agricultural projects under the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme (CACS). These disbursements brought the cumulative disbursements under this Scheme to N74432 billion for 678 projects in agro-production and agro-processing. As part of its effort to support the manufacturing sector, the CBN disbursed the sum of N11308 billion to 19 new projects under the Real Sector Facility. The funds were utilized for both greenfield and brownfield projects under the COVID-19 Intervention for the Manufacturing Sector (CIMS) and the Real Sector Support Facility from Differentiated Cash Reserve Requirement (RSSF-DCRR). Cumulative disbursements under the Real Sector Facility currently stands at N2183 trillion for the financing of 414 real sector projects across the country. Furthermore under the 100 for 100 Policy on Production and Productivity, the Bank has released N998 billion for five projects, bringing the cumulative disbursements under the intervention to N6813 billion for 48 projects, comprising twenty-six (26) in manufacturing, seventeen (17) in agriculture, three in healthcare and two in the services sector. In the healthcare sector, the Bank disbursed N444 billion to three healthcare projects under the Healthcare Sector Intervention Facility (HSIF), bringing the cumulative disbursements to N13342 billion for 129 projects, comprising seventy- six (76) hospitals, thirty-two (32) pharmaceuticals and twenty-one (21) other healthcare services. To further expand the nation's non-oil export basket under the Export Facilitation Initiative (EFI), the Bank released the sum of N3600 billion for five projects in domestic production and value addition of cocoa and sesame seeds towards improving non-oil foreign currency revenue. To improve electricity supply in order to lower the overall cost of production in the real sector, the Bank also intervened in the power sector to facilitate the deployment of enabling infrastructure. Summarily the sum of N253 billion was disbursed to Distribution Companies (DisCos) for their Operational Expenditure (OpEx) and Capital Expenditure (CapEx), under the Nigeria Electricity Market Stabilization Facility – Phase 2 (NEMSF-2). Cumulative disbursement under the NEMSF-2 currently stands at N25446 billion. Under the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP), the Bank disbursed N4782 billion for the procurement and installation of 865,,956 meters across the country. Outlook The broad outlook for both the global and domestic economies in the medium- term remain clouded with uncertainties associated with headwinds, such as the substantial disruptions to the supply chain, the Russian-Ukraine war and the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Others include the rising level of corporate and public debt in the Advanced Economies and Emerging Market and Developing Economies; as well as the broad shocks to foreign capital flows driven by the aggressive normalization of monetary policy in some of the Advanced Economies. On the domestic front, available data on key macroeconomic variables indicate the likelihood of a subdued output growth for the Nigerian economy in 2022. This is hinged on ongoing and expected shocks from the global economy, particularly from supply blockages of essential exports from both Russia and Ukraine; the impact of high crude oil prices, given Nigeria's position as an oil exporter and importer of refined petroleum products; and the aggressive normalization by some Advanced Economies. Accordingly the Nigerian economy is forecast to grow in 2022 by 333 per cent (CBN), 420 per cent (FGN) and 340 per cent (IMF). The Committee's Considerations The Committee assessed the impact of emerging external shocks and legacy issues on price development and the recovery of output growth in the short to medium term. Members further noted the continued effort by both the monetary and fiscal authorities to dampen price pressures and sustain the recovery of output growth. In the opinion of Members, the major external shocks to the economy remained those associated with the supply constraints arising from the Russia-Ukraine war and backlash from sanctions imposed on Russia; residual impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic; and tightening external financial conditions, following the aggressive normalization of monetary policy by some advanced economy central banks. On the domestic scene. Members assessed the impact of the continued upsurge in money supply resulting from the increased demand for money, associated with election spending and increase in month-on-month inflation between May and June 2022. In addition, the Committee assessed the continued impact of rising insecurity, the rising cost of Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), and the persisting upward pressure on other energy prices on the general price level. The MPC noted that the current upsurge in price levels remains a primary concern to monetary policy as Members focused on the optimal policy approach required to address this development while protecting the fragile recovery. The Committee clearly identified that inflationary pressure was being driven by both demand and supply-side factors, which should be addressed using different policy approaches. In the Committee's view, the demand-side factors were being broadly addressed by the Bank, using the relevant direct and indirect instruments. On the supply side, the Bank has continued to provide the necessary support, through its development finance initiatives in the real sector, to ease supply constraints. The Committee called on the Federal Government to prioritize efforts to curb the menace of insecurity to enable farming and other business activities return to normalcy. The MPC thus called on the Bank to continue its support to increase food supply in a bid to addressing food inflation. Members also noted the upward price pressure, particularly on transportation, resulting from the prolonged scarcity of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) and called on the Federal Government to seek a long-term and viable solution to strike a balance between the pricing and supply of PMS in Nigeria. The Committee appraised the continued recovery of output growth, noting that despite the obvious external and internal headwinds, the recovery has remained resilient with hopes of a stronger medium-term recovery. This is however, hinged on the continued support by the Bank and the Federal government to ensure that recent economic gains are sustained. The MPC welcomed the Bank's concerted efforts towards ensuring exchange rate stability, noting the current difficulties associated with managing the stream of external shocks impacting the economy. The Committee applauded the performance of the RT200 and similar initiatives targeted at improving accretion to reserves and stabilizing the exchange rate. The MPC noted that foreign exchange inflow through the RT200 FX Programme in Q1 and Q2, 2022, had increased substantially to approximately US$600 million as at June 2022. Members also noted the increase in Diaspora remittances as a result of the Naira for Dollar incentive and urged the Bank not to relent in its efforts to encourage foreign exchange inflow to the economy. The Committee noted the Federal Government's increasing debt profile and expressed concerns over debt sustainability given that global uncertainties remain elevated. The MPC thus reiterated its call to the Federal Government to urgently diversify its revenue sources through various initiatives, such as, the development of a viable tax framework for the extractive and mineral export industries, to strengthen its fiscal buffers. Despite the apparent headwinds confronting the economy, the MPC noted that the banking system remained robust given the continued decline in NPLs below the prudential threshold and enjoined the Bank to sustain the trend by maintaining its vigorous surveillance to ensure continued resilience of the banking industry. The Committee's Decision The MPC noted with concern the continued aggressive movement in inflation, even after the rate hike at its last meeting, and expressed its unrelenting resolve to restore price stability while providing the necessary support to strengthen the fragile recovery. As regards the decision as to whether to tighten, loose or hold. Members were unanimous and so did not consider both loosening and retaining rates at existing levels at this meeting. This is because on loosening, the MPC felt it could worsen the existing liquidity condition in the economy and further dampen money market rate, necessary to stimulate savings and investment. Members also felt that loosening would trigger the weakening of the exchange rate which could pass through to domestic prices. The MPC did not also consider retaining the policy rate because a hold stance may suggest that the Bank is not responding sufficiently, to both the global and domestic price development, as inflation numbers continue to trend aggressively upwards. As regards tightening policy stance. Members were unanimous that given the aggressive increase in inflation, coupled with the resultant negative consequences, particularly on the purchasing power of the poor, as well as retarding growth, there is the need to continue to tighten. However the policy dilemma was hinged around the level of tightening needed to rein-in inflation, without dampening manufacturing output, which could result from the higher cost of borrowing. Aside from narrowing the negative real interest rate gap. Members were also of the view that tightening would signal a strong determination of the Bank to aggressively address its price stability mandate and portray the MPC's sensitivity to the impact of inflation on vulnerable households and the need to improve their disposable income. Members also noted that the 150 basis points hike by the Committee in May 2022, had not permeated enough in the economy to halt the rising trend in inflation and noted that the month-on-month percentage point increase in headline inflation rose sharply in June 2022 compared with May 2022. The MPC also noted that other complementary administrative measures deployed by the Bank to address the growth in money supply did not moderate the inflationary trend. Addressing the balance of policy objectives and developments in the global and domestic environment, the Committee resolved that the most rational policy option would be to further strengthen its tightening stance in order to effectively curtail the unabated rising trend of inflation. Members were conscious of the fact that output growth remained fragile, however, not curtailing inflation now could erode the moderate gains achieved in improving consumer purchasing power and thus worsen poverty level for the vulnerable populace. To ensure that output still remains in focus, the MPC advised the Bank's Management to continue to use its development finance tools to support the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. The Committee thus voted unanimously to raise the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR). One member voted to increase the MPR by 150 basis points, six members by 100 basis points, one member by 75 basis points and three members by 50 basis points. Consequently the Committee resolved to increase the MPR by 100 basis points from 130 per cent to 140 per cent. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Increase the MPR from 130 to 140 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor at +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 275 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. thank you for your attention.

Pakistan,2022-07-20,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement July , 2022. At today's meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the policy rate by 125 basis points to 15 percent. In addition, as foreshadowed in the last monetary policy statement, the interest rates on EFS and LTFF loans are now being linked to the policy rate to strengthen monetary policy transmission, while continuing to incentivize exports by presently offering discount of 500 basis points relative to the policy rate. This combined action continues the monetary tightening underway since last September, which is aimed at ensuring soft landing of the economy amid an exceptionally challenging and uncertain global environment. It should help cool economic activity, prevent de-anchoring of inflation expectations and provide support to the Rupee in the wake of multi-year high inflation and record imports. Since the last meeting, the MPC noted three encouraging developments. First the unsustainable energy subsidy package was reversed and an FY23 budget centered on strong fiscal consolidation was passed. This has paved the way for completion of the on-going review of the IMF program, which will ensure that tail risks associated with meeting Pakistan's external financing needs are averted. Second $2. billion commercial loan from China helped provide support to FX reserves, which had been falling since January due to current account pressures, external debt repayments and paucity of fresh foreign inflows. Third economic activity remains robust, with the momentum of the last two years of near percent growth carrying into the start of FY23. As result. Pakistan faces significantly lower trade-off between growth and inflation than many countries where the post-Covid recovery has not been as vigorous. However, several adverse developments have overshadowed this positive news. Globally inflation is at multi-decade highs in most countries and central banks are responding aggressively, leading to depreciation pressure on most emerging market currencies. This strong monetary tightening has occurred despite concerns about slowdown in global growth and even recession risks, highlighting the primacy that central banks are placing on containing inflation at this juncture. Domestically as energy subsidies were reversed, both headline and core inflation increased significantly in June, rising to 14-year high. Inflation expectations of consumers and businesses also rose markedly. At the same time, the current account deficit unexpectedly spiked in May and the trade deficit continued its post-March widening trend to reach 7-month high in June, on burgeoning energy imports. As result. FX reserves and the Rupee remained under pressure, further worsening the inflation outlook. Against this challenging backdrop, the MPC noted the importance of strong, timely and credible policy actions to moderate domestic demand, prevent compounding of inflationary pressures and reduce risks to external stability. Like most of the world. Pakistan is facing large negative income shock from high inflation and necessary but difficult increases in utility prices and taxes. Without decisive macroeconomic adjustments, there is significant risk of substantially worse outcomes that would compromise price stability, financial stability and growth. This could take the form of runaway inflation. FX reserve depletion and the need for sudden and aggressive tightening actions later that would be significantly more disruptive for economic activity and employment. Adjustment is difficult but necessary in Pakistan, as it is all over the world. However in the interest of social stability, the burden of this adjustment must be shared equitably across the population, by ensuring that the relatively well-off absorb most of the increase in utility prices and taxes while well-targeted and adequate assistance is provided to the more vulnerable. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN. Under the MPC's baseline outlook, headline inflation is likely to remain elevated around current levels for much of FY23 before falling sharply to the 5-7 percent target range by the end of FY24, driven by tight policies, normalization of global commodity prices, and beneficial base effects. While risks exist on both sides, those of significantly higher inflation dominate, prompting today's rate increase. Going forward, the MPC will remain data-dependent, paying particularly close attention to month-on-month inflation, the evolution of inflation expectations and global commodity prices, as well as developments on the fiscal and external fronts. Real sector. Pakistan's strong economic rebound from Covid continues, with the level of output surpassing pre- pandemic levels, unlike in many other emerging markets. The needed moderation in economic activity that was occurring through FY22 in response to monetary tightening has stalled in the last three months, fueled by an unwarranted fiscal expansion. Most demand indicators suggest robust growth since the last MPC—sales of cement. POL and automobiles increased month-on-month—and growth in LSM remains high. Looking ahead, growth is expected to moderate to 3-4 percent in FY23, on the back of monetary tightening and fiscal consolidation, helping to close the positive output gap and diminish demand-side pressures on inflation. This will pave the way for higher growth on more sustainable basis. External sector. After moderating in the previous three months, the current account deficit rose to $1. billion in May, on the back of lower exports and remittances partly due to the Eid holiday. Based on PBS data, the trade deficit rose to $4. billion in June, more than $1. billion higher than its February low. While non-energy imports have continued to moderate in the last three months on the back of curtailment measures by the government and the SBP, this decline has been more than offset by the significant increase in energy imports, which rose from low of $1. billion in February to an estimated record high of $3. billion in June. While this partly reflects higher prices, significantly higher volumes of petroleum also played significant role. Without prompt additional measures to curtail energy imports—for instance through early closure of markets, reduced electricity use by residential and commercial customers, and greater encouragement of work from home and car pooling—containing the trade deficit could become challenging. With such measures, the current account deficit is projected to narrow to around percent of GDP as imports moderate with cooling growth, while exports and remittances remain relatively resilient. The expected completion of the on-going IMF review will catalyze important additional funding from external sources that will ensure that Pakistan's external financing needs during FY23 are met. Pressures on the Rupee should then attenuate and SBP's FX reserves should gradually resume their previous upward trajectory during the course of FY23. Fiscal sector. The fiscal stance in FY22 was unexpectedly expansionary, with the primary deficit estimated at. percent of GDP, double that of the previous year and more than thrice the budgeted primary deficit of. percent of GDP. To compensate for this unwarranted fiscal impulse, this year's budget targets primary surplus of. percent of GDP, on the back of significantly higher tax revenue. This consolidation is appropriate given the very rapid economic growth rate of the previous two years and the need to ensure debt Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN sustainability amid high gross financing needs due to the relatively short maturity of Pakistan's domestic debt. It is critical that the envisaged fiscal consolidation is delivered. It would allow monetary and fiscal policy to resume the well-coordinated approach that characterized Pakistan's successful Covid response in FY20 and FY21, which supported growth while preserving fiscal and external buffers. At the same time, it is important that the new taxation measures are progressive. In particular, their burden should mainly be absorbed by the relatively better off while adequate protection is provided to the more vulnerable, for whom high food prices are particular concern. In this context, curbing food inflation through supply-side measures aimed at boosting output and resolving supply-chain bottlenecks should be high priority. Monetary and inflation outlook. In nominal terms, private sector credit grew by further percent (m/m) in May, driven by favorable developments in sectors like power, edible oil, construction-allied industries, as well as wholesale and retail trade. Demand for fixed investment and consumer loans also picked up, reflecting robust economic activity. Since the last MPC meeting, secondary market yields and cut-off rates in the government's auctions have ticked up in the wake of the high inflation reading in June. Headline inflation rose significantly from 13. percent (y/y) in May to 21. percent in June, the highest since 2008. The increase was broad-based—with energy, food and core inflation all rising significantly—and more than 80 percent of the items in the CPI basket experiencing inflation of above percent. Strong domestic demand and second-round effects of supply shocks are reflected in the rise of core inflation to 1. percent in urban areas and 13. percent in rural areas. At the same time, measures of both short and long- term inflation expectations continue to tick up. Despite the dampening effect of fiscal and monetary tightening on demand-pull inflation, inflation is likely to remain elevated around current levels for much of FY23 due to the large supply shock associated with the necessary reversal of fuel and electricity subsidies. As result, inflation during FY23 is forecast at around 18-20 percent before declining sharply during FY24. This baseline outlook is subject to significant uncertainty, with risks arising from the path of global commodity prices, the domestic fiscal policy stance, and the exchange rate. The MPC will continue to carefully monitor developments affecting medium-term prospects for inflation, financial stability, and growth and will take appropriate action to safeguard them. Page."
Euroarea,2022-07-21,"Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. Today, in line with our strong commitment to our price stability mandate, the Governing Council took further key steps to make sure inflation returns to our two per cent target over the medium term. We decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and approved the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI). The Governing Council judged that it is appropriate to take a larger first step on its policy rate normalisation path than signalled at its previous meeting. This decision is based on our updated assessment of inflation risks and the reinforced support provided by the TPI for the effective transmission of monetary policy. It will support the return of inflation to our medium-term target by strengthening the anchoring of inflation expectations and by ensuring that demand conditions adjust to deliver our inflation target in the medium term. At our upcoming meetings, further normalisation of interest rates will be appropriate. The frontloading today of the exit from negative interest rates allows us to make a transition to a meeting-by-meeting approach to our interest rate decisions. Our future policy rate path will continue to be data-dependent and will help us deliver on our two per cent inflation target over the medium term. In the context of our policy normalisation, we will evaluate options for remunerating excess liquidity holdings. We assessed that the establishment of the TPI is necessary to support the effective transmission of monetary policy. In particular, as we continue normalising monetary policy, the TPI will ensure that our monetary policy stance is transmitted smoothly across all euro area countries. The singleness of our monetary policy is a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate. The TPI will be an addition to our toolkit and can be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. The scale of TPI purchases depends on the severity of the risks facing policy transmission. By safeguarding the transmission mechanism, the TPI will allow the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate. In any event, the flexibility in reinvestments of redemptions coming due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) portfolio remains the first line of defence to counter risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic. The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website. The details of the TPI are described in a separate press release to be published at 15:45 CET. I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. Russia's unjustified aggression towards Ukraine is an ongoing drag on growth. The impact of high inflation on purchasing power, continuous supply constraints and higher uncertainty are having a dampening effect on the economy. Firms continue to face higher costs and disruptions in their supply chains, although there are tentative signs that some of the supply bottlenecks are easing. Taken together, these factors are significantly clouding the outlook for the second half of 2022 and beyond. At the same time, economic activity continues to benefit from the reopening of the economy, a strong labour market and fiscal policy support. In particular, the full reopening of the economy is supporting spending in the services sector. As people start to travel again, tourism is expected to help the economy in the third quarter of this year. Consumption is being supported by the savings that households built up during the pandemic and by a strong labour market. Fiscal policy is helping to cushion the impact of the war in Ukraine for those bearing the brunt of higher energy prices. Temporary and targeted measures should be tailored so as to limit the risk of fuelling inflationary pressures. Fiscal policies in all countries should aim at preserving debt sustainability, as well as raising the growth potential in a sustainable manner to enhance the recovery. Surging energy prices were again the most important component of overall inflation. Market-based indicators suggest that global energy prices will stay high in the near term. Food inflation also rose further, standing at 8.9 per cent in June, in part reflecting the importance of Ukraine and Russia as producers of agricultural goods. Persistent supply bottlenecks for industrial goods and recovering demand, especially in the services sector, are also contributing to the current high rates of inflation. Price pressures are spreading across more and more sectors, in part owing to the indirect impact of high energy costs across the whole economy. Accordingly, most measures of underlying inflation have risen further. We expect inflation to remain undesirably high for some time, owing to continued pressures from energy and food prices and pipeline pressures in the pricing chain. Higher inflationary pressures are also stemming from the depreciation of the euro exchange rate. But looking further ahead, in the absence of new disruptions, energy costs should stabilise and supply bottlenecks should ease, which, together with the ongoing policy normalisation, should support the return of inflation to our target. Job vacancies across many sectors show that there is robust demand for labour. Wage growth, also according to forward-looking indicators, has continued to increase gradually over the last few months, but still remains contained overall. Over time, the strengthening of the economy and some catch-up effects should support faster growth in wages. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent, although recent above-target revisions to some indicators warrant continued monitoring. A prolongation of the war in Ukraine remains a source of significant downside risk to growth, especially if energy supplies from Russia were to be disrupted to such an extent that it led to rationing for firms and households. The war may also further dampen confidence and aggravate supply-side constraints, while energy and food costs could remain persistently higher than expected. A faster deceleration in global growth would also pose a risk to the euro area outlook. The risks to the inflation outlook continue to be on the upside and have intensified, particularly in the short term. The risks to the medium-term inflation outlook include a durable worsening of the production capacity of our economy, persistently high energy and food prices, inflation expectations rising above our target and higher than anticipated wage rises. However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices. Market interest rates have been volatile as a result of the pronounced economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Bank funding costs have risen in recent months, which has increasingly fed into higher bank lending rates, in particular for households. While the volume of bank lending to households remains strong, it is expected to decline in view of lower demand. Lending to firms has also been robust as high production costs, inventory building and lower reliance on market funding have created a continued need for credit from banks. At the same time, demand for loans to finance investment has declined. Money growth has continued to moderate owing to lower liquid savings and lower Eurosystem asset purchases. Our most recent bank lending survey reports that credit standards tightened for all loan categories in the second quarter of the year, as banks are becoming more concerned about the risks faced by their customers in the current uncertain environment. Banks expect to continue tightening their credit standards in the third quarter. Summing up, inflation continues to be undesirably high and is expected to remain above our target for some time. The latest data indicate a slowdown in growth, clouding the outlook for the second half of 2022 and beyond. At the same time, this slowdown is being cushioned by a number of supportive factors. The Governing Council has today decided to raise the key ECB interest rates and approved the TPI. At our upcoming meetings, further normalisation of interest rates will be appropriate. Our future policy rate path will continue to be data-dependent and will help us deliver on our two per cent inflation target over the medium term. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation stabilises at our two per cent target over the medium term. Our new TPI will safeguard the smooth transmission of our monetary policy stance throughout the euro area as we keep adjusting the stance to address high inflation."
Turkiye,2022-07-21,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 14 percent. The escalating geopolitical risks has continued to be adversely realized and caused further weakening in the worldwide economic activity. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards and the likelihood of a recession has increased. Increasing concern over global food security driven by trade restrictions, high and volatile course of commodity prices, and the persistence of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly in food, have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and rigidities in labor markets. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks have increased and diversified their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. Robust growth in the beginning of the year continued in the second quarter as well, with the support of external demand. Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the tourism-led improvement in current account balance continues with a solid pace. On the other hand, high course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. Despite losing momentum, credit growth, and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. The Committee will continue to implement the strengthened macroprudential policy set decisively and take additional measures when needed. Increase in inflation is driven by rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2022-07-21,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 25% per annum. The decision to raise the key policy rate taken in June will continue to push up market rates. Improved attractiveness of hryvnia assets, coupled with the change in the official exchange rate and additional economic policy measures, will dampen demand on the FX market. Taking into account the planned inflows of official financing, this will help support the sufficient level of international reserves and thus maintain the macrofinancial stability. Inflation soared, reaching 21.5% yoy in June, which was mainly the result of war-driven shocks and global price pressures. The war caused a disruption of supply chains, a decrease in supply of some goods, higher business expenses, physical destruction of production facilities and infrastructure, and temporary occupation of some territories. Persistently high energy prices and record-high inflation in partner countries also fueled price pressures in Ukraine. Inflation expectations of businesses and households increased markedly. This was reflected in deteriorated maturity structure of bank deposits and higher spending on some durable goods, primarily imported goods. As a result, inflation has been growing rapidly over the last months, reaching 21.5% yoy in June. The price growth was unevenly spread geographically: inflation peaked in territories that were temporarily occupied or close to combat areas. Administrative measures of the NBU and the government  primarily fixing the hryvnia exchange rate and natural gas and heating tariffs  remained the key instruments to curb inflation. Price growth was also constrained by setting up supplies of goods through western borders and by excess supply of raw agricultural products caused by the sea port blockade. Inflation pressures will persist: inflation will exceed 30% yoy as of the end of 2022. It will slow considerably in the next years, albeit remaining much above the NBU's target of 5%, primarily due to the consequences of the war. Supply shocks caused by the full-scale war will continue to strongly affect price dynamics. The baseline scenario of the forecast envisages that Black Sea ports fully recover their operations from the start of the next year. At the same time, the probability remains high that russia will continue its terrorist attacks on infrastructure and production facilities in Ukrainian cities, which will disrupt logistics, increase businesses' risks, and destabilize expectations. Global energy prices will also remain high. Under such conditions, the NBU will conduct tight monetary policy, primarily aiming at preventing the imbalance of expectations, as well as raising interest in hryvnia assets and reducing the pressure on international reserves. This will support financial stability and somewhat reduce the inflationary pressure, but inflation will keep accelerating and will slightly exceed 30% at the end of the year. The NBU's baseline scenario contains a number of assumptions, including the assumptions that in 2023 logistics will recover, businesses will face lower risks, and harvests will increase gradually. This would have a positive impact on expectations and weaken the inflationary effect of supply shocks. A decline in global inflation and the NBU's tight monetary policy will additionally foster disinflation. Consumer and investment demand will remain restrained for a long time, which will also slow down inflation in the coming years. On the other hand, persistently high energy prices will be an obstacle to faster disinflation and will require a review of utility tariffs in order to balance state finances. Taking into account the consequences of the war and the large contribution of the increase in administered prices, inflation will drop to 20.7% in 2023, and 9.4% in 2024. Inflation is projected to return to the 5% target in 2025. The economy of Ukraine will shrink by a third in 2022 but will return to growth in 20232024 if the Black Sea ports are unblocked. The full-scale russian invasion caused a sharp fall in economic activity in Ukraine. A third of businesses suspended their operations at the start of the war, due to physical damage and temporary occupation of whole regions, high uncertainty and risks, disruption of logistical and production chains, and forced massive migration. As a result. GDP plunged in March and fell by 15.1% yoy as of the end of Q1 according to the flash estimate of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine (SSSU). However, the economic activity started to recover in April, and businesses and households gradually adapted to new conditions. This was also due to the liberation of northern oblasts and a decrease in the number of regions affected by active hostilities. According to the NBU's flash polls, only 14% of businesses remained dormant at the end of the spring. Still, the capacity utilization of operating businesses was much below compared to the pre-war period. As a result, the economy fell by around 40% yoy as of the end of Q2, as estimated by the NBU. Hostilities in the east and south of the country, destruction of infrastructure in other regions, the blockade of sea ports, and weak demand in the majority of sectors will restrain economic recovery in the next months. A major contribution to the decline in GDP will come from weaker activity in agriculture due to the temporary occupation and laying landmines, loss of equipment and elevators, and occasional untimely and insufficient treatment of land with fertilizers and plant protection products. This will lead to the economy shrinking by a third this year. When the active phase of the war is over, it is expected that consumer demand will rise moderately, technological and logistical processes will be set up, and investment activity will revive, among other things, thanks to Ukraine's European integration prospects. However, in view of the large losses of production and human potential and the still-high security risks, the Ukrainian economy will recover at the rate of around 5%6% per year in 20232024. Despite showing a temporary surplus thanks to international aid, in future, the current account will return to deficit on the back of the economy's high need for imports, including imports for recovery. Although slumping at the beginning of the russian invasion. Ukraine's foreign trade recovered gradually in the following months. Compared to MarchApril, imports grew faster than exports, due to their less heavy dependence on the blocked sea lanes, rebounding domestic demand, and the expansion of the list of critical imports. This widened the external trade deficit. Large-scale migration has led to significant spending by Ukrainians abroad and increased cash withdrawals in other countries. FX outflows were partially offset by international aid, including grants, sustainable remittances from labor migrants, and a reduction in reinvested earnings. As a result, although the current account posted a surplus in JanuaryMay, the overall balance of payments recorded a deficit. Looking ahead, the current account will return to deficit, driven by the economy's high need for imports, including imports for recovery. The deficit will be offset by substantial international aid. Ukraine's continued cooperation with its international partners will remain one of the key factors in supporting the economy during the full-scale war and contributing to its recovery after the active phase of hostilities ends. Ongoing military and financial assistance from Ukraine's international partner countries will enable the country to maintain its defense capabilities, while also meeting a significant portion of its budgetary needs in 2022. Ukraine is expected to continue to actively work together with international financial organizations in 20232024, including through the launch of a new IMF program to support the balance of payments and macroeconomic stability. Ukraine's cooperation with the IMF and the country's continued European integration will help strengthen state institutions and allow it to implement other structural reforms. A prudent economic policy is also a necessary prerequisite for delivering macroeconomic stability and ensuring the NBU's baseline scenario materializes. Among other things, the following measures are important, with their effect taken into account in the baseline scenario:. narrowing the budget deficit through prioritizing expenditures and raising revenues, as well as through gradually reducing imbalances in the energy sectorreplacing the monetary financing of the budget with market borrowingdecreasing demand for imports by imposing additional taxes on imports.The key risk to the forecast is that the war of liberation against the russian invaders will last longer. If materialized, this risk will delay economic recovery and the return of inflation to its target. Other risks with differing effects are also important. the unbalancing of state finances (in particular due to the lack of measures to achieve fiscal consolidation and to activate market mechanisms for financing the budget deficit), which could pose a threat to macrofinancial stability, including to control over inflationary processesincreased emigration, which could threaten to reduce the labor force and have long-term negative effects on the labor market and economic growth after the wara global economic downturn, which will decrease global commodity prices and, consequently, export earnings, while also stepping up pressure on the hryvnia exchange rate and consumer prices.The rapid approval and launch of a recovery plan for Ukraine, generating foreign investment inflows and substantial funding for the country's recovery projects, which could significantly accelerate economic growth and return inflation to its target more quickly than envisaged by the baseline scenario of the NBU's forecast. In view of the protracted period of significant pressures on prices and the prevalence of inflationary risks on the forecast horizon, coupled with the need to ensure the attractiveness of hryvnia assets and maintain exchange rate stability, the NBU Board decided to keep the key policy rate unchanged, at 25%. The operational design of monetary policy remains unchanged, in particular interest rates on certificates of deposit and overnight refinancing loans. This will ensure the continued pass-through of the effects on market rates of the June increase in the key policy rate and interest rates on NBU monetary operations. The NBU welcomes the Ministry of Finance's decision to raise interest rates on annual hryvnia domestic government debt securities at the latest primary auction, and expects that yields on these securities will continue to reach a level that will stimulate demand for these instruments from banks and other portfolio investors. Increasing the attractiveness of hryvnia assets is an important element for stabilizing expectations and ensuring macrofinancial stability. The baseline scenario of the macroeconomic forecast envisages that the key policy rate will be maintained at 25% at least until Q2 2024. At the same time, the balance of risks to the key policy rate forecast is assessed as having shifted upwards. If these risks materialize, the NBU could raise its key policy rate and interest rates on its monetary operations beyond their current levels in order to safeguard monetary stability and to ensure inflationary processes remain under control. If required, the NBU stands ready to take additional measures to protect international reserves, improve monetary transmission, and rein in inflationary pressures. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 25% per annum, was approved by an NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate  No. 363, dated 21 July 2022. А new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 28 July 2022. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 1 August 2022. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 8 September 2022, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
South Africa,2022-07-21,"PRESS STATEMENT 21 July 2022 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and aggravated geo-political tensions, the global economy has entered a period of persistently high inflation and weaker economic growth. Many developing economies have yet to recover fully from the pandemic. Russia's war in Ukraine will continue to impair production and trade of a wide range of energy, food and other commodities. The supply of energy to the Euro Area is limited as winter approaches, and is likely to reduce growth this year and next. With rapid inflation and withdrawal of policy stimulus, the United States will also experience slower economic growth. China's recovery from the Covid-19 outbreak and resultant lockdowns remains uncertain. The much-needed resumption of international travel and tourism will take time to generate large benefits. Taking these and other factors into account, the SARB's forecast for global growth in 2022 is revised down from 3.5% in the May meeting to 3.3%, and is lowered to 2.5% (from 2.7%) for 2023 and 2024.1 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has signalled 1 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. MPC Statement 21 July 2022 Page 1 a lower global growth forecast for 2022 and 2023 in its upcoming World Economic Outlook Update.2 Although policy settings in advanced economies remain broadly accommodative, policy normalization by major central banks has accelerated, and higher yields are tightening global financial conditions. Investor appetite for riskier assets is weaker and asset values in major markets have declined sharply. Last year saw the South African economy expand by 4.9%. This year the economy is expected to grow by 2.0%, revised up from 1.7%. Growth in output in the first quarter of this year surprised to the upside, at 1.9%, stronger than the 0.9% expected at the time of the May meeting. Despite this outcome, flooding in Kwa-Zulu Natal and more extensive load-shedding are expected to result in a contraction of 1.1% in the second quarter. Growth in the third and fourth quarters is forecast to be 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively. The economy is forecast to expand by 1.3% in 2023 and by 1.5% in 2024, below the previous projection of 1.9% for both years at the time of the last meeting.3 Despite these downward revisions, economic growth remains above a low rate of potential.4 Private investment has strengthened on the back of the recovery, but public sector investment remains weak. Household spending remains supportive of growth, but is likely to soften next year due to higher inflation, lower asset prices, and rising interest rates. Tourism, hospitality and construction should see stronger recoveries as the year progresses. 2 An update to the World Economic Outlook will be released on 26 July. 3 The growth forecast includes expected changes in the policy rate. MPC Statement 21 July 2022 Page 2 With potential growth revised somewhat lower for this year and expected GDP growth higher, the output gap narrows slightly faster over the forecast period. The output gap is expected to turn positive in the second quarter of 2023. Overall, and after revisions, the risks to the medium-term domestic growth outlook are assessed to the downside. Commodity price movements in recent months have been mixed. The export price of coal has increased alongside oil, while prices for metals have declined. Oil prices spiked to around US$130 per barrel in the early days of the conflict in Ukraine. While oil prices currently sit at around US$106 per barrel, we expect them to stay higher than we did in May, and to average US$108 per barrel for 2022. US$92 per barrel in 2023 and US$85 per barrel in 2024.5 South Africa's export commodity price basket has come down from earlier peaks and is now forecast to rise by 3.2% for the year as a whole (down from 9.5%), before falling in 2023 by about 19.0% and by a further 8.0% in 2024. As a result of these export and import price and volume developments, the current account balance is expected to register a surplus of 2.0% of GDP this year, falling to 0.4% in 2023 and to reach a deficit of 0.4% in 2024.6 Although fiscal risk has eased on the back of better tax revenue and reduced borrowing needs, financing conditions remain tight and the yield curve for rand- denominated bonds is steep. Ten-year bond yields increased to about 11.4% in recent months. 5 The Brent crude oil assumptions in May were US$103. US$90, and US$85, respectively. 6 In May, the current account surplus for 2022 was expected to be about 2.1% of GDP, 0.8% in 2023 and 0.0% in 2024. MPC Statement 21 July 2022 Page 3 Policy normalisation in major economies and the slowdown in China have contributed to rand depreciation in recent months. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R16.10 to the US dollar, compared with R15.88 at the time of the previous meeting.7 While economic growth is slowing globally, inflation continues to surprise to the upside. Sustained policy accommodation, supply shortages and other restrictions have sharply increased the prices of many goods, services and commodities.8 Producer price increases continue to pass-through to wages and consumer prices globally. Our estimate for inflation in the G3 is revised higher to 6.9% in 2022 (from 6.3%) and up to 3.0% in 2023 (from 2.7%), and stays unchanged at 2.0% in 2024.9 A higher global oil price and rand weakness contribute to higher expected fuel price inflation for this year at 38.9% (up from 31.2%) and to 4.5% in 2023 (up from -0.3%). As a result of higher global food prices, local food price inflation is also revised up and is now expected to be 7.4% in 2022 (up from 6.6%), and 6.2% in 2023 (up from 5.6%). The food price inflation forecast for 2024 is unchanged at 4.2%. The Bank's forecast of headline inflation for this year is revised higher to 6.5% (from 5.9%). Higher food, fuel, and core inflation are expected to keep headline inflation elevated at 5.7% in 2023 (up from 5.0%). Headline inflation of 4.7% is expected in 2024, unchanged since the May meeting. 7 The rand has depreciated by about 6.3% to the US dollar since the May meeting and 7.2% year to date. 8 World food prices continue to rise. The assumption used for the forecast for USD-denominated world food prices in 2022 is revised higher from 15.3% to 22.3%. 9 The G3 comprises the United States, the Eurozone, and Japan. The latest CPI inflation in the respective components sits at 9.1%, 8.6% and 2.4%. MPC Statement 21 July 2022 Page 4 Core inflation is forecast higher at 4.3% in 2022 (up from 3.9%), rising to 5.6% (from 5.1%) in 2023. Our forecast for core inflation in 2024 is slightly higher at 4.9% (from 4.8%). Core goods and services price inflation are forecast higher through to the end of 2024, compared to May when only core goods inflation was rising each year.10 Nominal wages are forecast to rise by 5.6% in 2022, 7.3% in 2023 and 5.7% in 2024. The risks to the inflation outlook are assessed to the upside. Global producer price and food price inflation continued to surprise higher in recent months and may do so again. Russia's war in Ukraine is likely to persist for the rest of this year and may have significant further effects on global prices. Oil prices increased strongly from the start of the war and may rise further as stresses in energy markets intensify. Electricity and other administered prices continue to present short- and medium-term risks. Given below-inflation assumptions for public sector wage growth and higher petrol and food price inflation, considerable risk still attaches to the now elevated nominal wage forecast. Higher than expected inflation has pushed major central banks to accelerate the normalisation of policy rates, tightening global financial conditions and raising the risk profiles of economies needing foreign capital. We now expect G3 interest rate levels for the forecast period to be twice as high as expected in May.11 On balance, and with few exceptions, capital flows and market volatility are expected to remain elevated for emerging market assets and currencies. Alongside currency depreciation, other risks to the inflation outlook, such as increased food and fuel prices, have been realised, pushing up unit labour costs and 10 Core goods refers to total CPI goods excluding food and NAB, fuel and energy, whereas services include all surveyed services within the CPI basket. MPC Statement 21 July 2022 Page 5 expectations of future inflation. Average surveyed expectations of future inflation have increased to 6.0% for 2022 and 5.6% for 2023.12 Expectations for inflation based on market surveys have increased to 6.5%.13 Long-term inflation expectations derived from the break-even rates in the bond market have also increased.14 In the second quarter of this year, headline inflation breached the target range and is expected to remain above it until the second quarter of 2023. By the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect headline inflation to revert to the mid-point of the target range, on the back of declining fuel and food inflation. The forecast takes into account the policy rate trajectory indicated by the Bank's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM). As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting in response to new data and risks. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 75 basis points to 5.50% per year, with effect from the 22nd of July 2022. Three members of the Committee preferred the announced increase. One member preferred a 100 basis points increase. Another member preferred a 50 basis point increase. The revised repurchase rate path remains supportive of credit demand in the near term, while raising rates to levels consistent with the current view of inflation risks. The 12 The (Q2) Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey expectations rose above the target midpoint to 6.0% (5.1%) for 2022 and 5.6% (5.0%) for 2023. 13 Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) in July expect inflation to be higher at 6.5% (6.0%) in 2022, 5.0% (4.7%) in 2023 and 4.4% in 2024. 14 Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These now sit at 6.97% for the 5-year and 7.49% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year break-even inflation sits at 7.64%. MPC Statement 21 July 2022 Page 6 aim of policy is to stabilise inflation expectations more firmly around the mid-point of the target band and to increase confidence of hitting the inflation target in 2024.15 Guiding inflation back towards the mid-point of the target band can reduce the economic costs of high inflation and enable lower interest rates in the future. Achieving a prudent public debt level, increasing the supply of energy, moderating administered price inflation and keeping wage growth in line with productivity gains would enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy. Economic and financial conditions are expected to remain more volatile for the foreseeable future. In this uncertain environment, monetary policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. The MPC will seek to look through temporary price shocks and focus on potential second round effects and the risks of de-anchoring inflation expectations. The Bank will continue to closely monitor funding markets for stress. Lesetja Kganyago GOVERNOR The next statement of the Monetary Policy Committee will be released on 22 September 2022. Contact person: Thoraya Pandy 0824168416 media@resbank.co.za 15 The forecasted trajectory for the repurchase rate implies a rise in the inflation-adjusted repo rate from -1.7% for 2021 to -2.0% for 2022, 1.0% for 2023, and 2.0% in 2024. The real repurchase rate calculation here is based on the 1-quarter ahead inflation forecast and are annual average rates."
Russia,2022-07-22,"On 22 July 2022, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 150 basis points to 8.00% per annum. Current consumer price growth rates remain low, contributing to a further slowdown in annual inflation. This is due to both the influence of a set of one-off factors and the subdued consumer demand. Inflation expectations of households and businesses have significantly decreased, reaching the levels of spring 2021. The decline in business activity is slower than the Bank of Russia expected in June. However, the external environment for the Russian economy remains challenging and continues to significantly constrain economic activity. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of key rate reduction in the second half of 2022. According to the Bank of Russia forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will edge down to 12.015.0% in 2022, to 5.07.0% in 2023, and return to 4% in 2024. Inflation movements. Current consumer price growth rates remain low, contributing to a further slowdown in annual inflation. In June, annual inflation fell to 15.9% (after 17.1% in May) and, according to estimates as of 15 July, fell to 15.5%. The decline in headline inflation was largely due to continued adjustment in prices for goods and services after they went up sharply in March. This was supported by the dynamics of the ruble exchange rate and generally subdued consumer demand. Concurrently, according to the Bank of Russia's estimates, indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are still above 4% (annualised). A further significant reduction in inflation expectations also contributes to the inflation slowdown. In July, households' inflation expectations and businesses' price expectations have decreased significantly and reached the levels of spring 2021, largely reflecting the ruble's strengthening and inflation's general slowdown. Medium term inflation expectations of professional analysts are close to 4%. In the baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia expects annual inflation to fall to 12.015.0% by the end of 2022. Important factors for the future inflation movements will be the ruble exchange rate dynamics, effectiveness of import substitution processes, as well as the scale and pace of the recovery in the imports of finished goods, raw materials and components. According to the Bank of Russia forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will edge down to 5.07.0% in 2023, and return to 4% in 2024. Monetary conditions continued to ease, but generally remained tight, including as inflation expectations declined. Since the previous meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors, interest rates in the credit and deposit market, as well as short- and medium-term OFZ yields, have continued to decline. Yields on long-term OFZs did not change significantly. Despite the reduction in deposit rates already in place, the inflow of household funds to banks continued, but mainly to current accounts. The most liquid assets' growth in the structure of households' savings creates conditions for a rise in consumption in the future. The increased risk premium in lending rates and the banks' high requirements to borrowers kept the price and non-price bank lending conditions rigid. For this reason, lending activity, though it was showing signs of recovery, remained moderate. Lending was largely supported by governmental subsidised lending programmes. The decisions made by the Bank of Russia in April—July to reduce the key rate will increase the availability of credit resources in the economy and limit the decline in economic activity. Economic activity. The external environment for the Russian economy remains challenging and significantly constrains economic activity. Concurrently, operational indicators show that the decline in business activity is slower than the Bank of Russia expected in June. Furthermore, trends across sectors and regions remain largely mixed. The decline in economic activity is caused by developments in both supply and demand. According to survey data, companies are still facing difficulties in production and logistics. However, their business sentiment is gradually improving as suppliers of finished products, raw materials and components, as well as sales markets, diversify. Consumer activity remains subdued, but is beginning to recover, including amid a gradual increase in imports of consumer goods. Concurrently, the decline in imports as a whole, due to the introduction of external trade and financial restrictions, is still significantly ahead of the decline in exports. The situation in the labour market remains stable. Although the number of vacancies from employers has decreased, the unemployment rate is near historical lows. The adaptation of the labour market to the changed conditions largely occurs through the mechanism of part-time employment and the adjustment of real wages. In its baseline scenario, given the current trends in economy, the Bank of Russia forecasts GDP decline by 4.06.0% in 2022. This decline will be in significant part driven by supply-side factors. GDP growth in 2023 will still be negative to total (-4.0)—(-1.0)% to reflect the base effect of 2022 Q1 and a more prolonged output reduction. In 2024. GDP growth is expected within the range of 1.52.5%. Inflation risks. Short-term disinflationary risks have grown. However, proinflationary risks remain considerable and still dominate over a mid-term horizon. In the baseline scenario, short-term risks are largely associated with the volatility of the ruble exchange rate, which is indicative of the changes in foreign trade flows. The disinflationary effect on the short-term horizon may be caused by the persistence of households' high propensity to save in the conditions of general economic uncertainty, prolonged habituation to the new structure of supply in consumer markets, and expectations of further price decline amid the strengthening of the ruble since the beginning of the year. In turn, a persisting high risk premium in credit rates and higher borrower requirements of banks may restrain the recovery of credit activity. A good harvest of agricultural products in 2022 may be an additional disinflationary factor. A proinflationary factor over the short-term horizon may be an accelerated decline in households' propensity to save in the context of growing consumer confidence and the revival of consumer lending. The accelerated growth of consumer lending can be supported by easing banks' requirements to borrowers and decreasing risk premiums in interest rates. If combined, these factors can lead to consumer demand outstripping the capacity to expand output. In turn, the volatility of the ruble exchange rate may impede the anchoring of inflation expectations. The movements of the economy and inflation largely depend on fiscal policy decisions. The Bank of Russia takes into account the decisions already made regarding the mid-term expenditure path of the federal budget and the fiscal system as a whole. In case of a further budget deficit expansion, tighter monetary policy may be required to return inflation to target in 2024 and keep it close to 4% further on. The combination of risks created by the external environment may produce both proinflationary and disinflationary effects. A further aggravation of external trade and financial restrictions may have a proinflationary effect, thereby leading to a weaker ruble and a sharper decline in the potential of the Russian economy than expected in the baseline scenario. Supply-side constraints may in particular strengthen because of a slow replenishment of stocks of finished goods, raw materials and components in the event of persistently negative trends in imports. In turn, the realisation of the growing risks of a global recession may further weaken external demand for Russian exports and, as a result, provoke a weaker rouble. Disinflationary effects could be caused by maintaining a significant trade surplus amid more stable dynamics of exports compared to imports. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of key rate reduction in the second half of 2022. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting of 22 July 2022 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 16 September 2022. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Kazakhstan,2022-07-25,"Press Release The base rate was raised to 14.5% July 25, 2022 Nur-Sultan The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to set the base rate at 14.5% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1.00 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities set on 15.5% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 13.5%. Actual inflation significantly exceeded the forecasted trajectory against the background of accelerating inflation expectations. Both the stable component of consumer prices and the general price level are growing. The inflation rate in May and June of this year shows that its peak has not been passed. High inflationary expectations increase the pro-inflationary pressure. According to estimates of the National Bank, inflation by the end of 2022 will exceed the previous forecast. In the absence of new shocks, annual inflation growth will continue until the first quarter of 2023 and will slow down thereafter. The current decision aims at stabilizing and slowing down inflationary processes and expectations in 2023 and bringing inflation closer to the target in the medium term. The persistence of ongoing inflation processes, fiscal demand stimulation and the external pro-inflationary background require maintaining the base rate at current levels for a prolonged period to stimulate the savings behavior of the population, which will gradually affect inflation over the next year. In June 2022, annual inflation accelerated to 14.5%. Prices are rising for all its components, particularly, food products (19.2%), non-food products (13.2%) and paid services (9.2%). This is the result of cost-push inflation due to supply chain disruptions, increased external inflationary pressures, strong demand supported by fiscal stimulus, as well as weakening of the tenge. Core inflation began to accelerate again, outpacing overall inflation and indicating prevalence of sustainable price growth factors. Inflation expectations also demonstrate acceleration. For instance, in June 2022, the median estimate of expected inflation over a one-year horizon rose to 14.9% (the same being 13.8% in May). Given the formation of actual inflation and inflation expectations at higher levels in May-June, the National Bank expects acceleration of annual inflation in 2022 above the upper bound of the previously announced forecast of 13-15%. A new assessment will be made upon the results of the next forecast round. Over the first half of 2022, the economy grew by 3.4%, overall in line with National Bank forecasts of 2.8-3.8% by the end of 2022. All major sectors of the economy are growing, but some sectors show a slowdown. Thus, the growth of the mining industry slowed down due to the repair work at the Kashagan field. At the same time, trade indicators show stable demand, despite the acceleration of inflationary processes. Aggregate demand is driven by strong government spending, which is growing at an annual rate of 18.7% in June. This is a significant pro-inflationary factor and requires appropriate adjustment of monetary conditions. Global economic growth forecasts have been revised downwards. The World Bank has reduced the projected growth of the global economy in 2022 from 4.1% to 2.9%. Forecasts of growth for trading partners of Kazakhstan were also lowered: for Russia from 2.4% to 8.9%, for the EU from 4.2% to 2.5%, for China from 5.1% to 4.3%. The risks of a weaker global economy due to geopolitical conflict, probable strengthening of quarantine in China, failures in the supply chain remain. The oil price rally resumed after some pressure at the beginning of July 2022. Oil prices are supported by some weakening of the U.S. dollar from peak levels and limited oil inventories. With the worsening outlook for global economic growth, the EIA estimates Brent price will average $104 per barrel in Q3 2022, $95 per barrel by the end of the year, and above $90 per barrel in 2023. The global inflationary backdrop remains high, while external monetary conditions are tightening. The FAO Food Price Index fell 2.3 percent in June, mainly due to vegetable oils, grains and sugar, but is still 23.1 percent above last year and near historic highs. In June 2022, annual inflation in the U.S. and the EU due to rising energy and food prices broke through a historic high again, reaching 9.1% and 9.6%, respectively. Amid heightened inflationary pressures, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its June 2022 rate immediately by 0.75 p.p. (the first since 1994) to 1.5%-1.75% per year and is signaling further hikes this year and next. The ECB, in turn, raised its interest rate by 0.5 p.p. for the first time in 11 years. At the same time, the regulator reported the likelihood of further rate hikes in the coming months. The next decision on the base rate will be made based on the results of the summer forecasting round and the updated forecast trajectory of macroeconomic indicators, the balance of risks in the external environment and the domestic economy. The next scheduled decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on September 5, 2022 at 14:00 Nur-Sultan time with a press briefing on the same day at 16:00."
Hungary,2022-07-26,"At its meeting on 26 July 2022, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 27 July 2022:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. The Russia-Ukraine war, a possible new wave of Covid-19, high commodity prices and ongoing disruptions in supply chains increase recession risks in global economy. The recent effects of financial market developments and persistently high commodity and energy prices as well as the worsening European drought, point to a prolonged period of high external inflation. There has been a general deterioration in investor sentiment since the end of June. Risk appetite has been driven by news on the war, expectations for interest rate increases by the world's leading central banks, concerns caused by persistently high inflation, fears of recession and developments related to the coronavirus pandemic. Global prices of most of major commodities remain at high levels. By contrast, certain metals and oil prices have declined since the June interest rate decision. In response to persistently high inflation, monetary conditions have been tightened further by the world's leading central banks as well as the region's central banks. At its policy meeting in July, the European Central Bank raised its policy rate by 50 basis points, and ceased its asset purchase programme (APP) on 1 July. In the CEE region, the Polish central bank raised its key policy rate by 50 basis points and the Romanian central bank by 100 basis points. Hungarian economic growth has been slowing; however, annual dynamics remain buoyant. In May, industrial production and construction output continued to expand on an annual basis. The turnover of retail stores also rose at a double-digit rate in May relative to a year earlier. The labour market continues to be tight, and the unemployment rate remains low. Following a strong growth in the first half of 2022, real time data suggest a considerable slowdown in growth, which reflects the phase-out of single income support, restrained government investment and companies' rising costs in addition to the deterioration in external economic activity. The time profile and structure of domestic GDP growth have strongly shown a dual nature in 2022. The rate of economic growth is likely to slow in the second half of the year. Components of domestic demand, particularly household consumption, are expected to contribute to growth this year. By contrast, net exports are likely to hold down the expansion. Looking forward, however, consumption and investment dynamics are also expected to slow considerably, while net exports are expected to make a positive contribution to GDP growth again as external markets and supply chains recover. Despite the temporary slowdown, the investment rate is expected to stabilise at a high level of above 27 percent on the forecast horizon. In June 2022, annual inflation was 11.7 percent and core inflation stood at 13.8 percent. Food prices rose at a rate above 20 percent relative to the same period a year earlier. Repricings in June continued to be much greater than the level in recent years. Generally rising costs continue to quickly feed through to consumer prices. The Government's measures affecting fuel and household energy prices are providing a cushion against the spillover of the increase in global commodity prices into domestic inflation. However, inflation expectations remain elevated. The rise in energy, commodity and food prices continues to quickly feed through to consumer prices. Price dynamics are expected to peak during the autumn months and then to decline at a modest pace. The future course of price cap measures and the Government's announcements regarding the household prices of electricity and natural gas are expected to have a significant effect on the timing of the peak and the subsequent inflation path. Preventing second-round effects and anchoring inflation expectations are crucial in terms of achieving the inflation target. Inflation is expected to return to the central bank tolerance band at the end of 2023, as the first-round effects of war tensions abate, external inflationary effects moderate, the inflationary effects of the tax measures announced in June fade and as a result of the proactive central bank measures, and then to meet the 3 percent central bank target in the first half of 2024. The measures announced by the Government and their implementation are expected to ensure that the fiscal objectives will be met this year and next. As a result of economic growth and declining deficit, the government debt-to-GDP ratio may fall from 76.6 percent at the end of the previous year to below 75 percent in 2022, followed by further declines of around 2.5 percentage points each year. The current account deficit is expected to temporarily rise further in 2022. The deterioration in the trade balance this year is likely to reflect the deterioration in the terms of trade due to high energy prices, the slowdown in external markets, and imports in connection with buoyant domestic demand. However, significant new export capacities have been built in recent years, and as a result, the external balance is expected to improve quickly as the global economic environment normalises. The economy's net lending position may return to positive territory at the end of the forecast horizon. Upside risks to inflation have strengthened further since the June interest rate decision, while the risk of second-round inflationary effects has increased. The situation in financial markets has recently increased the risk of persistent inflationary effects, posing a clear threat to price stability. In order to avoid the above risks, it has become necessary to tighten monetary conditions further; therefore, the Monetary Council decided to raise central bank interest rates by 200 basis points on 12 July. A combination of the central bank measures and the Government's expenditure-side budget measures have together mitigated financial market risks. In the Monetary Council's assessment, it is warranted to tighten the base rate in a decisive manner in order to anchor inflation expectations and mitigate second-round inflation risks. The MNB continues to stand ready to respond quickly and flexibly by setting the interest rate on the one-week deposit instrument if warranted by the rise in short-term risks in financial and commodity markets. According to today's decision of the Monetary Council, the central bank base rate was raised by 100 basis points to 10.75 percent. The overnight deposit rate was increased by 100 basis points to 10.25 percent, and the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates were increased by 100 basis points to 13.25 percent. According to the Monetary Council's assessment, it is warranted to increase the interest rate on the one-week deposit instrument by the same measure as in the base rate. The Bank considers it crucial that short-term rates in every sub-market, particularly in the swap market, and at all times develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. To that end, on 8 July 2022, the MNB started the use of swap tenders providing foreign currency liquidity within quarters and holds tenders on a daily basis. By maintaining an active presence in the market, the MNB enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, thereby supporting the achievement and maintenance of price stability. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank started the cycle of interest rate hikes one year ago, first among the central banks in the European Union. The further rise in inflation and persistent inflation risks warrant the decisive continuation of the tightening cycle. The MNB continuously monitors developments in financial market risks as well and stands ready to intervene in a decisive manner using every instrument in its monetary policy toolkit, if necessary. Maintaining tighter monetary conditions for a longer period is warranted to manage increasing second-round inflation risks resulting from persistently negative supply effects. The Monetary Council will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes until the outlook for inflation stabilises around the central bank target in a sustainable manner and inflation risks become evenly balanced on the horizon of monetary policy."
United States,2022-07-27,"EDT July 27, 2022 Recent indicators of spending and production have softened. Nonetheless, job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Russia's war against Ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT July 27, 2022inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Colombia,2022-07-29,"The following press release details the aspects considered by the Board of Directors in its meeting of July 29. Six board members voted in favor of this decision and one voted for a 100 basis point increase. The decision was based on the following considerations. The annual inflation rate registered a new increase, moving from 9.1% in May to 9.7% in June. Core inflation excluding food and regulated items increased from 5.9% to 6.1% in the same period. Inflation expectations continue to rise. The monthly survey of economic analysts conducted by the Banco de la Republica found that, between June and July, expected inflation for 2022 increased from 8.6% to 9.2%, and for 2023 from 4.7% to 5.2%, according to the sample median. Excess demand remains as economic activity continues strong. For 2022, the technical staff revised the growth forecast upward, from 6.3% to 6.9%. World inflation continues rising and has become more persistent as, concurrently, fears of a global recession have generated large volatility in financial markets. With the decision adopted in today's session, the Board of Directors continues the monetary policy adjustment process that ensures a return to the 3% inflation target in the medium term. To this end, it will make the decisions it deems necessary, based on new information available. Fecha de publicacion."
Pakistan,2022-08-02,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement August 2, 2022. At today's meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the policy rate at 15 percent. To cool the overheating economy and contain the current account deficit, the policy rate has been raised by cumulative 800 basis points since last September, some temporary administrative steps have recently been taken to curtail imports, and strong fiscal consolidation is planned for FY23. These actions are expected to work their way through the system over the coming months. With recent inflation developments in line with expectations, domestic demand beginning to moderate and the external position showing some improvement, the MPC felt that it was prudent to take pause at this stage. Looking ahead, the MPC intends to remain data-dependent, paying close attention to month-on-month inflation, inflation expectations, developments on the fiscal and external fronts, as well as global commodity prices and interest rate decisions by major central banks. Since the last meeting, the MPC noted three key domestic developments. First headline inflation rose further to 24. percent in July, with core inflation also ticking up. This was expected given the necessary reversal of the energy subsidy package—effects of which will continue to manifest in inflation out-turns throughout the rest of the fiscal year—as well as momentum in the prices of essential food items and exchange rate weakness last month. Second the trade balance fell sharply in July and the Rupee has reversed course during August, appreciating by around 10 percent on improved fundamentals and sentiment. Third the Board meeting on the on-going review under the IMF program will take place on August 29th and is expected to release further tranche of $1. billion, as well as catalyzing financing from multilateral and bilateral lenders. In addition. Pakistan has also successfully secured an additional $4 billion from friendly countries over and above its external financing needs in FY23. As result. FX reserves will be further augmented through the course of the year, helping to reduce external vulnerability. In terms of international developments, the MPC noted that both global commodity prices and the US dollar have fallen in recent weeks, in response to signs of sharper than anticipated slowdown in global growth and nascent market expectations that the US Federal Reserve tightening cycle may be less aggressive than previously anticipated. In contrast to the trend since last summer, more emerging market central banks have started to hold policy rates in their recent meetings. This suggests that globally, risks may be shifting slightly from inflation toward growth, although this remains highly uncertain at this stage. On balance, the MPC noted that some greater slowdown in global growth would not be as harmful for Pakistan as for most other emerging economies, given the relatively small share of exports and foreign private inflows in the economy. As result, both inflation and the current account deficit should fall as global commodity prices ease, while growth would not be as badly affected. Real sector. As expected, economic activity has moderated since the last MPC. Most demand indicators have softened—sales of cement. POL, fertilizers and automobiles fell month-on-month in July—and year-on-year growth in LSM almost halved in June. Recent flooding caused by unusually heavy and prolonged monsoon rains creates downside risks for agricultural production, especially cotton and seasonal crops, and could weigh on growth this year. Looking ahead, the MPC continues to expect growth to moderate to 3-4 percent in Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN FY23, on account of the tightening of fiscal and monetary policies. This will ease demand-side pressures on inflation and the current account, and lay the ground for higher growth in future on more sustainable basis. For higher and more sustainable growth over the medium-term, structural reforms to decisively move Pakistan's growth model away from consumption toward exports and investment are also urgently needed. External sector. After widening significantly in June, the trade deficit halved to $2. billion last month, as energy imports declined significantly and non-energy imports continued to moderate. According to PBS data, imports fell sharply by 36. percent (m/m) and 10. percent (y/y). Exports also declined by 2. percent (m/m), largely due to Eid holidays but also on some emerging signs of slower global demand. Meanwhile remittances remained strong. As result of these better current account developments and improved sentiment due to diminished uncertainty about the IMF program, the Rupee has recovered in August. In addition to slower domestic demand, the recent decline in imports also reflects temporary administrative measures, including the requirement of prior approval before importing machinery and CKDs of automobiles and mobile phones. These administrative measures are not sustainable and will need to be eased in coming months. In order to ensure that the overall import bill remains contained as these measures are eased, it will be critical that the envisaged fiscal consolidation in FY23 is delivered and that strong measures are taken to curtail energy imports. Such measures include early closure of markets, reduced electricity use by residential and commercial customers, and greater encouragement of work from home and car pooling. Notwithstanding the recent improvement in the current account and the Rupee. FX reserves have halved from $16. billion in February to $7. billion on August 12th, as official inflows have been outpaced by official outflows. The drying up of official inflows—namely multilateral, bilateral, and commercial borrowing as well as Eurobond and Sukuk issuance—was in large part due to the delay in completing the review of the IMF program because of policy slippages. Meanwhile on the outflows side, debt servicing on foreign borrowing continued as repayments came due. However with the expected completion of the upcoming IMF review and the additional assistance secured from friendly countries. FX reserves are projected to rise to around $16 billion during FY23. To ensure this and to support the Rupee going forward, it will be important to contain the current account deficit to around percent of GDP by moderating domestic demand and energy imports. In addition, it will be critical to keep the IMF program on-track by following through on the agreed fiscal tightening and structural reforms over the next 12 months. Fiscal sector. For the first time in seven years, the FY23 budget targets primary surplus, on the back of significantly higher tax revenue. It envisages strong fiscal consolidation of around percent of GDP, which is appropriate to cool the economy and ensure reduction in inflation and the current account deficit through the year. It is imperative that this fiscal consolidation is delivered and that the budgeted measures are fully implemented, notably with regard to the important decisions to align domestic energy prices with international prices and broaden the tax base, while providing targeted subsidies to the most vulnerable. Resorting to measures that impose additional burden on those already in the tax net or measures that are not progressive would be detrimental for growth and employment, as well as social stability. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary and inflation outlook. Private sector credit grew by around 21 percent (y/y) in FY22, somewhat faster than nominal GDP. The expansion was broad-based, with working capital loans accounting for the largest share owing to strong activity in sectors like textiles, food, construction, energy and wholesale and retail trade. In real terms, private sector credit growth was more subdued last year and actually declined by percent in June, consistent with moderating pace of economic growth. As desired, since the last MPC meeting, secondary market yields and cut-off rates in the government's auctions are now well-aligned with the policy rate. As expected, inflationary pressures intensified in July, with headline inflation rising by further 3½ percentage points to 24. percent (y/y). The main contributors were food and energy inflation but core inflation also rose further, particularly in rural areas. In coming months, curbing food inflation through supply-side measures that boost output and resolve supply-chain bottlenecks should be high priority. Encouragingly there is evidence that inflation expectations of businesses have eased significantly. Looking ahead, headline inflation is projected to peak in the first quarter before declining gradually through the rest of the fiscal year. Thereafter it is expected to decline sharply and fall to the 5-7 percent target range by the end of FY24, supported by the lagged effects of tight monetary and fiscal policies, the normalization of global commodity prices, and beneficial base effects. This baseline outlook remains subject to uncertainty, with risks arising from the path of global commodity prices, the domestic fiscal policy stance, and the exchange rate. The MPC will continue to carefully monitor developments affecting medium-term prospects for inflation, financial stability, and growth. Page."
Brazil,2022-08-03,"In its 248th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate to 13.75% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's scenario:. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; and an increase in the risk premium due to the uncertainty about the country's future fiscal framework and additional fiscal stimuli that support aggregate demand, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset prices. Among the downside risks, it should be noted a possible reversion, even if partial, of the increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency; and a greater deceleration of economic activity than projected. The Committee assesses that the possibility that fiscal policies that support aggregate demand become permanent heightens the upside risks of the inflationary scenario. On the other hand, the Committee notes that the rising risk of a greater global deceleration increases the downside risks to inflation. The Committee assesses that the still uncertain and volatile current scenario requires serenity when evaluating the prospective risks. The Committee noted that inflation projections for the years of 2022 and 2023 were heavily impacted by temporary tax measures across calendar years. Therefore, the Committee decided at this moment to emphasize the projections for 12-month inflation in the first quarter of 2024, which reflects the relevant horizon, smoothens out the primary effects from tax changes, but incorporates their second-round effects on the relevant inflation projections for monetary policy decisions. Taking into account the assessed scenarios, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 0.50 p.p. to 13.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and, to a lesser extent, 2024. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment. The Committee considers that, given its inflation projections and the risk of a deanchoring of long-term expectations, it is appropriate to continue advancing in the process of monetary tightening significantly into even more restrictive territory. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process consolidates and anchors expectations around its targets. The Committee will evaluate the need for a residual adjustment, of lower magnitude, in its next meeting. The Copom emphasizes that it will remain vigilant and that future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets. It also stresses that the uncertainty of the current scenario, both domestic and foreign ones, coupled with the advanced stage of the current monetary policy cycle, and its cumulative impacts yet to be observed, require additional caution in its actions. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto de Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Diogo Abry Guillen. Fernanda Magalhaes Rumenos Guardado. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza and Renato Dias de Brito Gomes. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Czech Republic,2022-08-04,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board kept interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate remains at 7%, the discount rate at 6% and the Lombard rate at 8%. Five members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for increasing rates by one percentage point.. The CNB's interest rates are at a level that is dampening domestic demand pressures. They are slowing growth in loans to households and firms and hence also in the quantity of money in the economy. The Bank Board agreed that long-term price stability is also contingent on moderate wage bargaining demands and responsible fiscal policy. The Bank Board will wait for further data and will assess them. It will decide at the next meeting whether rates will remain unchanged or increase. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. In the baseline scenario of the forecast, the monetary policy horizon is shifted to 1824 months ahead due to extraordinary cost pressures amid exceptionally high uncertainty. The Bank Board also discussed other scenarios. The Czech National Bank will continue to prevent excessive fluctuations of the koruna. The Czech economy is facing both strong cost inflation pressures from the external environment and demand pressures from the domestic economy. Household consumption, which is crucial for the future course of demand-pull inflation, is being dampened by high energy and food prices, negative sentiment and higher interest rates. On the other hand, unemployment remains low. Industrial production has so far been resilient to the increased costs and supply chain problems. However, external demand is now having a negative effect on GDP. Leading indicators point to a further slowdown in external demand. The effect of fiscal policy on economic activity is now broadly neutral. According to our new forecast, inflation will rise further in the coming few months. The rise will be due mainly to gas and electricity prices. We expect inflation to reach around 20% in the autumn and to average 16.5% for the year as a whole (in our spring forecast we expected 13.1%). According to the forecast, inflation should decline to around 2% in a year and a half. GDP grew by 3.5% last year. According to the forecast, economic growth will drop to 2.3% this year (the spring forecast for GDP growth this year was 0.8%). A further slowdown to 1.1% is expected for next year (the spring forecast was 3.6%). We expect domestic demand to slow. Household consumption will be hit by a decline in real income, as wage growth will not cover growth in living costs. Firms are facing rising costs of energy and other commodities and materials, and will rein in investment for that reason as well. According to the baseline scenario of the forecast, three-month market interest rates (3M PRIBOR) will be broadly stable initially and decline gradually next year. The forecast expects the koruna exchange rate to depreciate modestly in the next few quarters. As far as the external environment is concerned, our new forecast assumes that the inflation pressures will be stronger this year. A deterioration in economic sentiment and growth in households' living costs and firms' expenses, coupled with monetary policy tightening by major central banks, will gradually lead to a downturn in global economic activity and a decrease in inflation pressures in the years ahead. The Bank Board assessed the risks and uncertainties of the baseline scenario of the forecast as being significant and going in both directions. A further rise in commodity prices, a threat of inflation expectations becoming unanchored, a related risk of a wage-inflation spiral and easier fiscal policy are upside risks to inflation. By contrast, the growing likelihood of recession abroad and a stronger-than-forecasted downturn in domestic consumer and investment demand are downside risks. The general uncertainties of the outlook include the future course of the war in Ukraine, the availability and prices of energy, the future monetary policy stance abroad and the duration of the disruptions to global supply chains."
India,2022-08-05,"Monetary Policy Statement, 2022-23 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) August 3-5, 2022 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (August 5, 2022) decided to: Increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 50 basis points to 5.40 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 5.15 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 5.65 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Since the MPC's meeting in June 2022, the global economic and financial environment has deteriorated with the combined impact of monetary policy tightening across the world and the persisting war in Europe heightening risks of recession. Gripped by risk aversion, global financial markets have experienced surges of volatility and large sell-offs. The US dollar index soared to a two-decade high in July. Both advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) witnessed weakening of their currencies against the US dollar. EMEs are experiencing capital outflows and reserve losses which are exacerbating risks to their growth and financial stability. Domestic Economy 3. Domestic economic activity remains resilient. As on August 4, 2022, the south- west monsoon rainfall was 6 per cent above the long period average (LPA). Kharif2 sowing is picking up. High frequency indicators of activity in the industrial and services sectors are holding up. Urban demand is strengthening while rural demand is gradually catching up. Merchandise exports recorded a growth of 24.5 per cent during April-June 2022, with some moderation in July. Non-oil non-gold imports were robust, indicating strengthening domestic demand. CPI inflation eased to 7.0 per cent (year-on-year, y-o-y) during May-June 2022 from 7.8 per cent in April, although it persists above the upper tolerance band. Food inflation has registered some moderation, especially with the softening of edible oil prices, and deepening deflation in pulses and eggs. Fuel inflation moved back to double digits in June primarily due to the rise in LPG and kerosene prices. While core inflation (i.e. CPI excluding food and fuel) moderated in May-June due to the full direct impact of the cut in excise duties on petrol and diesel pump prices, effected on May 22, 2022, it remains at elevated levels. Overall system liquidity continues in surplus, with average daily absorption under the LAF at ₹3.8 lakh crore during June-July. Money supply (M3) and bank credit from commercial banks rose (y-o-y) by 7.9 per cent and 14.0 per cent, respectively, as on July 15, 2022. India's foreign exchange reserves were placed at US$ 573.9 billion as on July 29, 2022. Outlook 6. Spillovers from geopolitical shocks are imparting considerable uncertainty to the inflation trajectory. More recently, food and metal prices have come off their peaks. International crude oil prices have eased in recent weeks but remain elevated and volatile on supply concerns even as the global demand outlook is weakening. The appreciation of the US dollar can feed into imported inflation pressures. Rising kharif sowing augurs well for the domestic food price outlook. The shortfall in paddy sowing, however, needs to be watched closely, although stocks of rice are well above the buffer norms. Firms polled in the Reserve Bank's enterprise surveys expect input cost pressures to soften across sectors in H2. Cost pressures are, however, expected to get increasingly transmitted to output prices across manufacturing and services sectors. Taking into account these factors and on the assumption of a normal monsoon in 2022 and average crude oil price (Indian basket) of US$ 105 per barrel, the inflation projection is retained at 6.7 per cent in 2022-23, with Q2 at 7.1 per cent; Q3 at 6.4 per cent; and Q4 at 5.8 per cent, and risks evenly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2023-24 is projected at 5.0 per cent (Chart 1). On the outlook for growth, rural consumption is expected to benefit from the brightening agricultural prospects. The demand for contact-intensive services and the improvement in business and consumer sentiment should bolster discretionary spending and urban consumption. Investment activity is expected to get support from the government's capex push, improving bank credit and rising capacity utilisation. Firms polled in the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey expect sequential expansion in production volumes and new orders in Q2:2022-23, which is likely to sustain through Q4. On the other hand, elevated risks emanating from protracted geopolitical tensions, the upsurge in global financial market volatility and tightening global financial conditions continue to weigh heavily on the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, the real GDP growth projection for 2022-23 is retained at 7.2 per cent, with Q1 at 16.2 per cent; Q2 at 6.2 per cent; Q3 at 4.1 per cent; and Q4 at 4.0 per cent, and risks broadly balanced. Real GDP growth for Q1:2023-24 is projected at 6.7 per cent (Chart 2).3 8. Headline inflation has recently flattened and the supply outlook is improving, helped by some easing of global supply constraints. The MPC, however, noted that inflation is projected to remain above the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent through the first three quarters of 2022-23, entailing the risk of destabilising inflation expectations and triggering second round effects. Given the elevated level of inflation and resilience in domestic economic activity, the MPC took the view that further calibrated monetary policy action is needed to contain inflationary pressures, pull back headline inflation within the tolerance band closer to the target, and keep inflation expectations anchored so as to ensure that growth is sustained. Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.40 per cent. All members of the MPC  Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma. Dr.Rajiv Ranjan. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das  unanimously voted to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.40 per cent. All members - Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Dr.Rajiv Ranjan. Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das, except Prof. Jayanth R. Varma - voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published on August 19, 2022. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during September 28-30, 2022. (Yogesh Dayal) Press Release: 2022-2023/650 Chief General Manager."
Romania,2022-08-05,"In its meeting of 5 August 2022, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual inflation rate remained stuck to an upward path in June, yet at a slower pace, as anticipated, climbing to 15.05 percent from 14.49 percent in the previous month, mainly due to the new hikes in processed food and fuel prices, partly offset by the drop in VFE prices. In 2022 Q2 as a whole, the annual inflation rate saw a stronger rise than in the previous quarters (from 10.15 percent in March) and above expectations. Most of the increase came again from exogenous CPI components, primarily from the hefty and larger-than-anticipated hikes in electricity and natural gas prices, given the changes made to the price capping schemes in April, as well as the further high international prices. Additional influences stemmed from fuel prices, following the advance in the crude oil price, amid the war in Ukraine and the associated sanctions, but also due to the US dollar strengthening against the euro. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate further witnessed a steeper upward path in 2022 Q2, climbing from 7.1 percent in March to 9.8 percent in June, slightly above the forecast, particularly under the influence of new increases in processed food prices. Specifically, the evolution of this component continues to reflect the effects of surges in commodity prices, mainly agri-food prices, and of elevated energy and transportation costs, alongside the influences of production chain bottlenecks, compounded by high short-term inflation expectations, the release of pent-up demand in certain segments, as well as by the significant share of food items and imported goods in the CPI basket. Average annual CPI inflation rate and average annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP  inflation indicator for EU Member States) went up to 9.3 percent and 7.9 percent respectively in June, from 6.5 percent and 5.6 percent respectively in March 2022. The new statistical data reconfirm the strong economic growth in 2022 Q1, i.e. 5.1 percent against 2021 Q4. This implies a relatively moderate increase in the positive output gap in this period. At the same time, the step-up in the annual dynamics of GDP in 2022 Q1, to 6.4 percent from 2.4 percent in 2021 Q4, is reconfirmed. Behind the swifter growth rate stood mainly private consumption, yet on account of other sub-components than purchases of goods and services  which reported a markedly lower increase in annual terms, inter alia amid a base effect , while the contribution from the change in inventories came second in size. A notable contribution was also made by gross fixed capital formation, as a result of the strong re-acceleration against the same year-earlier period of both net investment in equipment (transport equipment included) and new construction works. In addition, net exports further acted towards improving economic growth  their contribution to annual GDP dynamics re-entering positive territory for the first time in the past five years , as the rise in the annual change in the export volume of goods and services outpaced that in the import volume. However, the annual increase in the negative trade balance re-accelerated, amid the relatively more unfavourable developments in import prices, while the current account deficit saw a considerably faster deepening trend against the same period of the previous year, inter alia as a result of the strong worsening in the primary income balance. The latest data and analyses point to a quasi-standstill of economic activity both in 2022 Q2 and Q3, under the impact of the war in Ukraine and the associated sanctions. GDP developments in Q2 imply a marked decline in its annual growth rate during this period, yet amid the robust rise in private consumption, also on account of a base effect. Relevant from this perspective is the re-acceleration in the annual growth of retail trade and services to households in April-May, counterbalanced only to a small extent by the large slowdown, to a marginally negative value, in the dynamics of motor vehicle and motorcycle trade. Conversely, industrial output saw a renewed widening in annual contraction, the volume of new manufacturing orders dropped as compared with the same year-ago period and the volume of new construction works almost stopped its increase in annual terms. At the same time, imports of goods and services posted significantly faster annual growth in the first two months of Q2, probably inter alia amid the adverse developments in external prices, which, along with the slower dynamics of exports, caused the high annual growth rate of trade deficit to almost double as compared with the Q1 average. However, the current account deficit posted a markedly lower annual increase than in the first quarter, amid the improved income balances, also with the contribution of inflows of EU funds to the current account. The number of employees in the economy continued to rise at a sustained pace in April-May, almost entirely on account of hiring in the private sector, and the ILO unemployment rate further declined to 5.3 percent in June, yet remaining slightly above pre-pandemic values. Nevertheless, the steady upward trend over the past almost two years in the labour shortage came to a halt, while the hiring intentions for the three-month horizon declined somewhat, in the context of mixed sectoral developments, probably explained by the effects and uncertainties generated by the war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed. Looking at the financial market, the main interbank money market rates have risen at a faster pace in the recent period, prompted by the monetary policy rate hike in July and the central bank's firm control over market liquidity. An important part in this process has been played by credit institutions' expectations, in the context of the domestic and international inflationary environment, as well as of the outlook for a protraction in geopolitical tensions. The yields on government securities posted, however, a slower advance, thereafter witnessing downward adjustments, in line with global developments in similar yields, amid the revision of economic growth expectations, given the faster normalisation of the monetary policy conduct by the Fed and the ECB, but also the protraction of the war in Ukraine and the extension of the associated sanctions. The average interest rate on new time deposits recorded a new significant hike in June, including in the household segment. At this juncture, while also reflecting a relatively higher attractiveness of domestic currency deposits, the leu posted a slight appreciation trend against the euro in July, additionally fostered by seasonally-driven domestic developments. The annual dynamics of credit to the private sector picked up further in June, reaching 17.5 percent (16.5 percent in May), yet against the backdrop of a mild moderation in domestic currency lending, whose impact was counterbalanced by the significant step-up in the dynamics of foreign currency-denominated loans to non-financial corporations. The share of leu-denominated loans in credit to the private sector fell slightly to 72 percent (from 72.7 percent in May). In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the August 2022 Inflation Report, which incorporates the latest available data and information. The updated forecast shows the prospects for the annual inflation rate to level off in 2022 Q3 and gradually decline later on, yet on a path revised moderately upwards. The prospects for the annual inflation rate to level off and decrease rely on a milder impact of global supply-side shocks  inter alia in the context of energy price capping schemes implemented until March 2023 , as well as on the sizeable disinflationary base effects, alongside the influences from the likely rapid contraction and closing of the positive output gap in mid-2023, followed by the output gap widening into negative territory. Against this background, the annual inflation rate is expected to post minor fluctuations in Q3, and then enter a gradual downward path for three quarters, but relatively fast afterwards, falling slightly below the mid-point of the target at the end of the projection horizon. Uncertainties are, nevertheless, associated with the presumed impact, but also the duration of energy and fuel price capping and compensation schemes. Notable risks also continue to come from developments in energy commodity prices, as well as from the persistent bottlenecks in production and supply chains — in the context of the war in Ukraine and the related sanctions —, to which add those from the protracted drought domestically and in other European countries. The war in Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia remain, however, a major source of uncertainties and risks to the outlook for economic activity, hence to medium-term inflation developments, through the possibly stronger effects exerted, via multiple channels, on consumer purchasing power and confidence, as well as on firms' activity, profits and investment plans, but also by potentially affecting more severely the European/global economy and the risk perception towards economies in the region, with an unfavourable impact on financing costs. At the same time, the absorption of EU funds, especially those under the Next Generation EU programme, is conditional on fulfilling strict milestones and targets for implementing the approved projects. However, it is essential for carrying out the necessary structural reforms, energy transition included, but also for counterbalancing, at least in part, the contractionary impact of supply-side shocks, compounded by the war in Ukraine. It is vital to absorb and reap the full benefits of these funds. Major uncertainties and risks are also associated, however, with the fiscal policy stance, given the requirement for further budget consolidation amid the excessive deficit procedure and the overall tightening trend of financing conditions, yet in a challenging economic and social environment domestically and globally, which led to the implementation of several packages of measures to support households and firms, with potential adverse implications for budget parameters. From this perspective, the coordinates of the envisaged budgetary revision are particularly important. Also relevant are the ECB's and the Fed's prospective monetary policy stances, as well as the behaviour of central banks in the region. In the meeting held today, 5 August 2022, based on the currently available data and assessments, as well as in light of the very elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 5.50 percent per annum from 4.75 percent per annum as of 8 August 2022. Moreover, it decided to raise the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 6.50 percent per annum from 5.75 percent per annum and the deposit facility rate to 4.50 percent per annum from 3.75 percent per annum, as well as to maintain firm control over money market liquidity. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to keep the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to anchor inflation expectations over the medium term, as well as to foster saving through higher bank rates, so as to bring back the annual inflation rate in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat target on a lasting basis, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The NBR closely monitors developments in the domestic and international environment and will continue to use the tools at its disposal to achieve the fundamental objective of price stability in the medium term. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 9 August 2022 at 11:00 a.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 19 August 2022 at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board will be held on 5 October 2022."
Thailand,2022-08-10,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 4/2022 Mr. Piti Disyatat. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 10 August 2022 as follows. The Committee voted 6 to 1 to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 050 to 075 percent, effective immediately. One member voted to raise the policy rate by 050 percentage point. Economic recovery has continued to strengthen. The Thai economy is expected to return to the pre-COVID level by the end of this year and will continue to gain traction. Headline inflation will remain at a high level for some time. The Committee assesses that the extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy undertaken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has become less needed. Most members thus voted to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point at this meeting. One member voted to raise the policy rate by 050 percentage point to reduce the risk of having to increase the policy rate aggressively later and views that such a rate increase will not significantly affect the economic recovery. The Thai economy is projected to continue recovering with strong momentum. This is attributable to a larger-than-expected number of foreign tourist arrivals following the relaxation of international travel restrictions and improved travel sentiments. In addition, private consumption would continue to recover in line with improvements in labor market conditions and household incomes. Although the risk of global slowdown has heightened, the impact on the Thai economy would be limited. Nonetheless there remains a need to monitor risks to the growth outlook in the period ahead, especially the impact of rising living costs on private consumption. Headline inflation will remain at a high level throughout 2022, largely unchanged from the previous forecast, before gradually falling into the target range in 2023 as the supply-side inflationary pressures subside. Meanwhile medium-term inflation expectations have not increased significantly. Going forward, the inflation outlook is still subject to upside risks, including potentially higher and faster cost pass-through to core inflation. The Committee will continue to closely monitor inflation dynamics, cost pass-through, and inflation expectations. Overall financial system remains resilient. Commercial banks have high levels of capital fund and loan loss provision. Liquidity in the financial system remains ample, although liquidity distribution still varies across economic sectors. Debt serviceability of households and businesses has improved in line with the economic recovery. However there are certain 2 vulnerable groups, particularly some SMEs that have yet to fully recover as well as low- income households that are sensitive to the rising living costs. The Committee views that financial institutions should continue to press ahead with debt restructuring and deems it important to have targeted measures and sustainable solutions in place for vulnerable groups. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative but with high volatility. The baht has depreciated against the US dollar mainly due to the strengthening of the US dollar following concerns about the global economic slowdown and the Fed tightening. The Committee will closely monitor developments and volatilities in financial and exchange rate markets. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee judges that the Thai economic recovery will continue to gain traction, and thus the extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy will become less needed. The Committee views that the policy rate should be normalized to the level that is consistent with sustainable growth in the long term. Monetary policy normalization should be done in a gradual and measured manner consistent with the growth and inflation outlook in the period ahead."
Mexico,2022-08-11,"World economic activity weakened during the second quarter and recent indicators suggest that said weakness would persist during the third quarter. Inflation continued increasing, in some cases reaching once again levels unseen in decades, in an environment where unbalances between demand and supply in diverse markets and high levels of food and energy prices persist. This continues generating expectations of a fast withdrawal of monetary stimulus worldwide. Financial conditions remained tight while the dollar continued gaining strength. In its latest monetary policy decision, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points for a second consecutive time and anticipated future adjustments. Job creation in that country accelerated at the beginning of the third quarter and, although the latest figure on US inflation displayed a moderation, it still remains at high levels. In turn, a large number of other central banks have continued raising their reference rates, some of them at a higher-than-foreseen magnitude. Among key global risks are those associated with the pandemic, the persistence of inflationary pressures, the intensification of geopolitical turmoil, and greater adjustments in economic, monetary and financial conditions. In domestic financial markets, the peso remained stable, while short-term interest rates increased and long-term ones decreased. Recent information indicates that during the second quarter of 2022, economic activity grew at a similar rate to that observed during the first quarter, thus continuing its gradual recovery, while slack conditions decreased. Nevertheless, an environment of uncertainty prevails, while the balance of risks remains biased to the downside. The accumulated inflationary pressures associated with both the pandemic and the military conflict continue affecting headline and core inflation, which in July registered annual variations of 8.15% and 7.65%, respectively, thus remaining at elevated levels unseen in two decades. Their expectations for 2022 rose again while those for 2023 and for the medium term increased to a lesser extent. Long-term expectations for headline inflation remained stable, although at levels above target, while those for core inflation increased at the margin. In view of greater-than-anticipated inflationary pressures, forecasts for headline and core inflation were revised upwards up to the third quarter of 2023, although convergence to the 3% target is still projected to be attained in the first quarter of 2024 (see Table). These projections are subject to risks. On the upside: persistence of core inflation at high levels; external inflationary pressures associated with the pandemic; greater pressures on agricultural and livestock product prices and on energy prices due to the ongoing geopolitical conflict; exchange rate depreciation; and cost-related pressures. On the downside: a greater-than-anticipated slowdown in world economic activity; a decline in the intensity of the geopolitical conflict; a better functioning of supply chains; a greater-than-expected effect from 1 the negative output gap; and a larger-than-anticipated effect from the Policy Program to Fight Inflation and High Prices (PACIC, for its Spanish acronym). The balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon remains biased significantly to the upside. The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the evolution of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process. It also considered the increasing challenges for monetary policy stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of significant uncertainty, and inflationary pressures accumulated as a result of the pandemic and the geopolitical conflict, as well as the possibility of greater effects on inflation. Based on these considerations, and with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 75 basis points to 8.50%. With this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon. The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations. This, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times, with both the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets. The Board will assess the magnitude of the upward adjustments in the reference rate for its next policy decisions based on the prevailing conditions. 2/ Forecast starting June 2022.

Peru,2022-08-11,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT AUGUST 2022 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 6.50% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 50 bps to 6.50 percent, thus continuing to normalize its monetary policy stance. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation decreased from 8.81 percent in June to 8.74 percent in July, above the target range, due to significant increases in international food and fuel prices. Core inflation rose from 4.95 percent in June to 5.44 percent in July, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The significant increase in international food and fuel prices since the second half of last year, accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in global inflation in magnitudes not seen in many years and towards levels significantly higher than the inflation targets of central banks, both in advanced and other economies in the region. Thus, inflation is expected to return to the target range in the second half of next year. A downward trend in year-on-year inflation is forecast due to a moderation of the impact of international food and fuel prices, and to a reduction in inflation expectations. One-year-ahead expected inflation decreased from 5.35 to 5.16 percent between June and July, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most leading indicators and expectations for economic activity deteriorated in July and remain pessimistic. The outlook for global economic activity this year and the next has deteriorated due to the expected unwinding of stimulus in advanced economies, international conflicts, and persistent global supply bottlenecks, despite some improvement in recent months. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants, including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, with an aim to consider changes in the monetary stance so that inflation returns to the target range over the forecast horizon. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 4.50 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 7.00 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months and the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months. In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates based on the amount of the operations. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on September 8, 2022."
Philippines,2022-08-17,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to raise the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility by 50 basis points to 3.75 percent, effective tomorrow, 19 August 2022. Accordingly, the interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were raised to 3.25 percent and 4.25 percent, respectively. The BSP's latest baseline forecasts have shifted higher for 2022, with average inflation projected to breach the upper end of the 2-4 percent target range at 5.4 percent. While the forecasts for 2023 and 2024 have declined to 4.0 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively, the inflation target remains at risk over the policy horizon owing to broadening price pressures. Elevated inflation expectations likewise highlight the risk of further second-round effects. Upside risks also continue to dominate the inflation outlook up to 2023 due to the potential impact of higher global non-oil prices, the continued shortage in domestic fish supply, the sharp increase in the price of sugar, as well as pending petitions for transport fare increases. Meanwhile, the impact of a weaker-than-expected global economic recovery as well as the resurgence of local COVID-19 infections continue to be the main downside risks to the outlook. At the same time, despite some moderation in economic activity in recent months, overall domestic demand conditions have generally held firm, supported by improved employment outturns and by ample liquidity and credit. For these reasons, the Monetary Board deemed further monetary action to be necessary to anchor inflation expectations and avoid a further breach in the inflation target over the policy horizon. The favorable growth outcome in the first half of the year also gives the BSP the flexibility to act against inflation pressures while allowing domestic demand to sustain its recovery momentum amid prevailing headwinds. The Monetary Board also continues to urge timely non-monetary government interventions to mitigate the impact of persistent supply-side pressures on commodity prices. The BSP reassures the public of its commitment and readiness to take all necessary actions to steer inflation towards a target-consistent path over the medium term in keeping with its price and financial stability mandates."
Egypt,2022-08-18,"Press Release  August 18th, 2022 MPC decided to keep key policy rates unchanged In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 1125 percent, 1225 percent, and 1175 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1175 percen. Global economic activity has continued to slow down affected by spillovers from the Russo- Ukrainian conflict, while increased geopolitical risk in South-East Asia is raising uncertainty regarding the global economic outloo. Furthermore despite edging down recently, global financial conditions have remained relatively tight as major central banks have continued to raise policy rates and reduce asset purchase programs with the aim of containing increased inflationary pressures in their respective countrie. Meanwhile global commodity prices have slightly declined after reaching their peak following the Russo-Ukrainian conflic. Domestic economic activity is estimated to have grown by a preliminary figure of 62 percent in fiscal year 2021/22, compared to 33 percent in the previous fiscal yea. This reflects stronger than previously expected growt. Latest available data for the first nine months of the fiscal year shows that GDP growth was mainly driven by the private sector, particularly non-petroleum manufacturing, tourism, and trad. Meanwhile public sector activity was supported by natural gas extractions. Suez Canal and the general governmen. Moreover most leading indicators remained in positive territory in 2022 Q2. Going forward, economic activity is expected to be supported by the government's planned structural reform. This however, will be at a slower pace than previously projected, given the negative spillovers emanating from the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, among other factor. Regarding the labor market, the unemployment rate stabilized at 72 percent in 2022 Q2. The witnessed stability comes in light of both employment and the labor force figures increasing by similar magnitudes, offsetting one anothe. In July 2022, annual headline urban inflation resumed its upward trend, that started in December 2021, to record 136 percent, that is after decelerating in June 2022 to record 132 percen. In addition. July's annual core inflation - which excludes volatile food and regulated items - recorded 156 percent in July 2022 from 146 percent during the previous mont. The increase was driven by higher prices of core food, retail items and service. This can be mainly attributed to the seasonal impact of Eid Al-Adha, the repercussions of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, as well as, the indirect effects of higher prices of fuel product. The MPC decided that keeping policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving price stability over the medium ter. The MPC treats the developments emanating from the Russo- Ukrainian conflict to be among the exogenous shocks that are outside the scope of monetary policy and yet may lead to transitory deviations from pre-announced target rate. Monetary policy tools are utilized to anchor inflation expectations, contain demand-side pressures and second-round effects emanating from supply shocks that may lead to deviations from inflation target. Therefore in accommodation of the first-round effects of supply shocks, the elevated annual headline inflation rate will be temporarily tolerated relative to the CBE's pre-announced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4, before declining thereafte. In its decision to maintain policy rates unchanged today, the MPC takes note of its policy rate hikes in its previous meetings, and will continue to assess their impact on inflation expectations and other macroeconomic developments over the medium ter. Achieving low and stable inflation over the medium term is a requisite condition to achieve sustainable economic growt. The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations, rather than of prevailing inflation rates and as such, will not hesitate to adjust its stance to achieve its price stability mandat.

Turkiye,2022-08-18,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 14 percent to 13 percent. The weakening effects of geopolitical risks on global economic activity continue to increase. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards and recession is increasingly assessed as an inevitable risk factor. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the upward trend in producer and consumer prices continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and rigidities in labor markets. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. Robust growth in the beginning of the year continued in the second quarter as well, with the support of external demand. Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues. On the other hand, high course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. In addition, the recent increase in spread between policy rate and the loan interest rate is considered to reduce the effectiveness of monetary transmission. In this context, the Committee decided to further strengthen the macroprudential policy set with tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism. Increase in inflation is driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. Additionally, leading indicators for the third quarter point to some loss of momentum in economic activity. It is important that financial conditions remain supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as escalating geopolitical risk. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to reduce the policy rate by 100 basis points, and has assessed that the updated level of policy rate is adequate under the current outlook. To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework.

Israel,2022-08-22,"Inflation in Israel is above the upper bound of the target range, at 5.2 percent over the past 12 months. The increase in inflation is broad-based, with contributions from most CPI components. Economic activity in Israel remains strong and the labor market remains tight and is in a full employment environment. GDP grew by 6.8 percent in the second quarter. Most GDP components grew significantly. GDP is abovethe precrisis trend line. One-year inflation expectations from the various sources declined, and are within the target range. Expectations derived from the capital market for the second year onward remain within the target range, and long-term expectations are anchored at the midpoint of the range. Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel strengthened by 6.9 percent against the US dollar, by 10.2 percent against the euro, andby 8.8 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The upward trend in home prices continues to accelerate, with prices increasing 17.8 percent in the past 12 months. There was also a rise in the monthly pace of rent price increases, which reached 0.7 percent in July. Global economic activity continues to moderate, in view of the high inflation and monetary tightening, the continuing war in Ukraine and energy crisis in Europe, the slowdown in China, and difficulties in the production chain. The Israeli economy is recording strong growth, accompanied by a tight labor market and an increase in the inflation environment. The Committee has therefore decided to continue the process of increasing the interest rate. The pace of raising the interest rate will be determined in accordance with activity data and the development of inflation, in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy goals. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, clickhere. Economic activity in Israel remains strong, and the labor market remains tight and in a full employment environment. However, the continued moderation of global activity, as well as political uncertainty in Israel, may weigh upon economic activity. Inflation continues to increase, and is above the target range. However, it is within the lowest decile among the OECD countries (Figure 31). Since the previous interest rate decision, the CPI increased by 0.4 percent in June and by 1.1 percent in July, and inflation in the past 12 months is above the upper bound of the target range, at 5.2 percent (Figure 1). With that, inflation in Israel remains significantly lower than in most of the advanced economies (Figure 31). Net of energy and fruits and vegetables, inflation is 4.7 percent, and with the further neutralization of the effects of taxation and regulation, it is 4.4 percent (Figure 2). The annual pace of inflation, of the tradable components is high, at about 7 percent, and it continued to increase. The pace of inflation of the nontradable components also increased, but is lower, at about 4.1 percent (Figure 3). In the Committee's assessment, alongside the process of raising the interest rate, the easing of the supply chain difficulties, declines in the prices of oil and some other commodities and in the excise tax, and the strengthening of the shekel will work to moderate inflation. One-year inflation expectations from the various sources declined, and all of them except for the expectations derived from the capital market are within the target range (<b>Figure 4). Expectations derived from the capital market for the second year and onward remain within the target range, and long-term expectations are anchored at the midpoint of the range (Figure 5). Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel strengthened by 6.9 percent against the US dollar, by 10.2 percent against the euro, and by 8.8 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate (Figure 6). Economic activity is strong. Following the publication of National Accounts data for the second quarter and the revision of 2021 data by the Central Bureau of Statistics. GDP in the past three quarters has been higher than the precrisis trend line (Figure 14). According to the first estimate of National Accounts data for the second quarter. GDP in the quarter grew by 6.8 percent relative to the first quarter of 2022 (Figure 12). The growth in GDP was broad-based (Figure 13). Private consumption, investment, and exports increased at double-digit rates. Compared to the second quarter of 2021. GDP has grown by 7.4 percent. Indicators of economic activity in the third quarter also continue to show increased activity. While the aggregate balance of the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey declined in July,it remains higher than the precrisis average, and continues to reflect businesses' positive assessments of their situation (Figure 15). Credit card purchases remained high in July and August. Due to the easing of pressure in the global supply chains, the magnitude of the equipment and raw materials constraint eased in both the manufacturing and construction industries. However, the level of the constraint remains significant, and higher than in the past. Goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds) declined, but remain higher than before the pandemic, and services exports remain very high (Figure 16). Goods imports are also high in all components (Figure 17).  The labor market is tight. The unemployment rate for those aged 15+ was 3.4 percent (seasonally adjusted), and the employment rate (61 percent) has been stable for a number of months, and is around its 2019 average levels. The employment rate among the prime working ages (25-64) is higher than its 2019 average (Figure 22). The number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate are very high, despite some decline in July. Businesses in most industries continue to indicate a shortage of workers as a constraint on their current operations (Figure 23). The tight labor market is also reflected in some wage pressures in the business sector (Figure 24), mainly in industries that generally feature high wages and professional employees. Wages in the public sector are increasing more moderately. Home prices increased by 17.8 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 9), a significantly higher pace than in previous years. However, the number of transactions declined in recent months, and the number of building starts and building permits is high, following increases in the first quarter. The volume of new mortgages taken out declined in July, to about NIS 10 billion, but it remains historically high (Figure 11). In the domestic capital market there were increases in the equity indices, similar to the global trend. Yields on long-term government bonds declined, and corporate bond spreads remained virtually unchanged (Figure 10). According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, financing constraints among businesses of various sizes remained relatively low in all sectors (<b>Figure 18). Global economic activity continues to moderate, in view of high inflation, monetary tightening, the continuing war in Ukraine and the energy crisis in Europe, the slowdownin China, and the supply chain difficulties. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth forecast downward to 3.2 percent in 2022 and 2.9 percent in 2023 (Figure 27). The volume of world trade increased in May, but its pace of growth since the beginning of the year is lower than it was in 2021. The global purchasing managers' indexof advanced economies declined in July, and indicates a continued slowdown of economic activity, while the index for the emerging markets declined, but indicates expansion (Figure 28). Nevertheless, there were sharp price increases in the equity markets (Figure 36). Oil prices declined in view of expectations of a continued slowdown in global economic activity and a decline in demand. In contrast, due to the decline in the flow of natural gas from Russia to Europe, there was a sharp increase in natural gas prices in Europe. The index of commodity prices returned to the level it was at the beginning of the year (Figure 34). There was a mixed trend in government bond markets, with high volatility. The global inflation environment continued to increase. In most countries, the inflation indices are significantly higher than the central bank targets. Monetary tightening around the world therefore continues. In the US, second quarter growth data indicate the beginning of a 'technical recession', but the labor market is tight and wage increases accelerated further. Inflation declined to 8.5 percent in view of the decline in energy prices, but remains very high. In its most recent meeting, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, for the second consecutive time, and emphasized its commitment to lower inflation. Growth data in the major economies in the eurozone were relatively high, except for Germany. The rapid increase in inflation continues, and the European Central Bank accelerated its monetary tightening and increased its interest rate by 50 basis points, the first increase since 2011. In a number of other countries where inflation is above the central bank target, there were increases in the interest rates (Figure 33). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on September, 5, 2022. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. October 3, 2022, followed by a press briefing with the Governor. The labor market is tight."
South Korea,2022-08-25,"The bank of korea. Monetary Policy Decision. (Statement). The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 2.25% to 2.50%. The Board judges that the policy response to prevent the entrenchment of high inflation should be continued as inflationary pressures and inflation expectations have remained high, although economic downside risks have increased at home and abroad. Currently available information suggests that global economic downside risks have increased, affected by the prolonged Ukraine crisis and significant policy rate hikes in major advanced countries, while inflation has remained high. In global financial markets, major price variables have fluctuated significantly due to changes in expectations for the pace of the US Federal Reserve's policy rate hikes. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the movements of international commodity prices and global inflation, economic indicators and monetary policy changes in major countries, and geopolitical risks. Downside risks to the Korean economy have increased with the slowdown in exports owing to weakening of economic growth in major countries, while private consumption has continued to recover. Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed remaining high. Going forward. GDP growth is projected to be 2.6% in 2022 and 2.1% in 2023, below the May forecast of 2.7% in 2022 and 2.4% in 2023, as export growth has slowed. Consumer price inflation has remained high in the 6% range due to the accelerating price increases in agricultural and personal services, although increases in the prices of petroleum products have somewhat moderated. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) and the inflation expectations of the general public have stayed high in the upper-3% range and the 4% range, respectively. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation could decline due to the decrease in global oil prices but will remain high in the 5-6% range for a considerable time as core inflation continues to rise. Consumer price inflation is projected to be 5.2% in 2022 and 3.7% in 2023, substantially above the May forecast of 4.5% in 2022 and 2.9% in 2023. Volatility in domestic financial markets has increased, influenced by global financial market movements. Long-term market interest rates have rebounded after a considerable decline, and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has risen significantly due to US dollar strengthening. Household loans have decreased slightly and housing prices have shifted to a decrease. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon as it monitors economic growth, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board sees continued rate hikes as warranted, as inflation is expected to remain high, substantially above the target level, despite the increase in economic downside risks and underlying high uncertainties surrounding domestic and external conditions. In this process the Board will determine the size and pace of further increases of the Base Rate while thoroughly assessing the degree of persistence of high inflation, the pace of growth, financial stability conditions such as capital flows, monetary policy changes in major countries, and geopolitical risks. Opening Remarks to the Press Conference. Today, the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) of the Bank of Korea decided to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 2.25% to 2.50%. I'll first go over global and domestic financial economic conditions and the future outlook, and then explain the background to today's Base Rate decision in detail. Looking at the changes in external conditions since the July MPB meeting, we've seen mounting concerns about a global economic slowdown, affected by the prolonged Ukraine crisis and significant rate hikes, while inflation has remained high at around 8-10% in major advanced economies. More specifically, the US has recorded a negative growth rate for two consecutive quarters due to a pullback in investment, and the euro area has witnessed a significant worsening of economic sentiment amid weak goods consumption. China's economy has been sluggish under the effects of its lockdown policy. Major price variables have fluctuated greatly in global financial markets due to the heightened uncertainties surrounding the pace of the US Federal Reserve's policy rate hikes. Government bond yields in major countries have rebounded after considerable falls, and the US dollar has recently shifted rapidly to appreciation after losing value. The Korean economy has still continued to recover supported by an improvement in consumption. However, downside risks are higher than before with a decline in export growth affected by weaker economic growth in major countries. Concerning inflation, consumer price inflation has run at the 6% level for two consecutive months and core inflation has stayed at around 4%, owing to the persistence of high inflationary pressures both from the supply and demand sides. The inflation expectations of the general public are in the 4% range. In the domestic financial markets, the volatility of major price variables has heightened. Long-term market interest rates have rebounded after a considerable decline due to changes in Treasury bond yields in major countries. The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has risen to around 1,340 won recently. Looking at financial stability, household loans in the financial sector decreased slightly in July, as the sustained net redemption of unsecured loans more than offset a rise in housing-related lending. Housing prices have shifted to a decrease since June. In reflection of changes in domestic and external conditions since the May economic outlook, the Bank of Korea has revisited its inflation and growth forecasts. Consumer price inflation is now projected to be 5.2% this year, substantially above the May forecast (4.5%), as both supply-side and demand-side pressures have expanded further than previously expected and inflation is becoming more broad-based. Consumer price inflation is possibly lower in August than in July, influenced by a sharp drop in oil prices over the past two months, but it is expected to remain high in the 5-6% range until early next year, considering the high uncertainties associated with future international energy prices due chiefly to the Ukraine crisis and the sustained uptrend in core inflation. GDP growth is expected to be 2.6% this year, slightly below the previous forecast (2.7%). This reflects the projection that, despite a recovery in private consumption, the slowdown in exports is likely to accelerate gradually from the second half of this year affected by the global economic slowdown. Concerning the economic outlook for next year, although uncertainties remain high, consumer price inflation is projected at 3.7% and growth at 2.1%. This is based on the assumptions that oil prices will fall at a modest pace in line with the global economic slowdown and that geopolitical risks including the Ukraine crisis will decrease gradually. The Director General of our Research Department will provide more details about the economic outlook this afternoon. The Board today raised the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 2.25% to 2.50%, in consideration of the need to continue its policy response in furtherance of price stability. All the Board members supported the decision unanimously. To elaborate more on the decision today, the Board judged that a gradual increase of 25 basis points, as suggested at last month's meeting, is appropriate since current economic conditions are not far from the Board's July projections for inflation and growth. That is, since the high inflationary pressure with consumer price inflation in the 5-6% range is expected to persist, the Board sees continued rate hikes as warranted to curb the spread of inflation expectations and prevent the entrenchment of high inflation. On the growth side, despite growing economic downside risks, it would be desirable to respond to the risks after further assessing developments of external conditions as uncertainties associated with the Ukraine crisis and the pace of the US Federal Reserve's policy rate hikes remain high. Looking ahead, the Bank of Korea sees it as desirable to conduct monetary policy with a focus placed on inflation and sees continued rate hikes as warranted for some time under the current inflation and growth forecast paths. Particularly since there are very high uncertainties associated with the degree of persistence of high inflation, the pace of growth, financial stability conditions such as capital flows, monetary policy changes in major countries, and geopolitical risks, the Bank of Korea will make sure to closely monitor the relevant developments in its conduct of monetary policy."
Hungary,2022-08-30,"At its meeting on 30 August 2022, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 31 August 2022:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. The Russia-Ukraine war, a possible new wave of Covid-19, high commodity prices and ongoing disruptions in supply chains are increasing recession risks in the global economy which are also exacerbated by a deterioration in confidence indicators. The effects of persistently high commodity and energy prices and the drought in Europe are increasing external inflationary effects further in the coming months; however, from 2023 onwards, global inflation is expected to fall alongside commodity and energy prices as economic growth declines. Risk appetite has been driven by news on the war, expectations for interest rate increases by the world's leading central banks, concerns caused by persistently high inflation, fears of recession and developments related to the coronavirus pandemic. In the first half of 2022, global prices of several commodities reached historic highs and then started to decline recently. Gas and electricity prices continued to rise significantly in European markets. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points at the end of July. In the CEE region, the Czech central bank did not raise its base rate any further in August, while the National Bank of Romania increased its key policy rate by 75 basis points. In the first half of 2022, the Hungarian economy grew strongly: GDP rose by 6.5 percent in the second quarter of 2022 relative to a year earlier. All sectors of the national economy contributed to economic growth, except for the agricultural sector. In June, industrial output continued to grow on an annual basis, while the volume of construction activity decreased. Following strong growth at the beginning of the year, the turnover of retail stores has been gradually declining since April. The labour market continues to be tight, and the unemployment rate remains low. High-frequency data indicate a clear slowdown in economic growth since the beginning of June. The global economic slowdown and the effects of high energy prices are increasingly reflected in the general deterioration of sentiment indicators. The time profile and structure of domestic GDP growth has been characterised by strong duality in 2022. The rate of annual economic growth is likely to slow significantly in the second half of the year. Components of domestic demand, particularly household consumption, are expected to contribute to growth throughout this year. By contrast, net exports are likely to hold down the expansion. Looking forward, consumption and investment dynamics are expected to slow considerably, while net exports are expected to make a positive contribution to GDP growth again as external markets and supply chains recover. In July 2022, annual inflation was 13.7 percent and core inflation stood at 16.7 percent. Inflation rose by 2.0 percentage points mainly due to an increase in the prices of food, manufactured goods and alcohol and tobacco products. Almost half of the monthly price change was caused by the rise in food prices. Producer prices continue to rise rapidly and feed through to a broad range of consumer prices. Inflation expectations are at a high level. In the autumn months, similarly to the developments in the global inflation environment, inflation is expected to rise further in Hungary. The exceptional drought, the price explosion in the energy market and changes in official energy price regulations have all contributed to the rise in consumer prices. However, increasing fears of global recession and the resulting fall in commodity prices are expected to reduce external inflationary effects from the end of the year. In terms of achieving the inflation target, it is still crucial to avoid second-round effects and to anchor inflation expectations in the medium term. The significant cash-based surplus of the central sub-sector of general government amounted to more than HUF 250 billion in July 2022. The measures announced by the Government and their implementation are expected to ensure that the fiscal objectives will be met this year and next. As a result of economic growth and the declining deficit, the government debt-to-GDP ratio may fall from 76.7 percent at the end of the previous year to below 75 percent in 2022, followed by further declines of around 2.5 percentage points each year. The current account deficit is expected to rise further temporarily in 2022. The deterioration in the trade balance this year is likely to reflect a worsening in the terms of trade due to high energy prices, the slowdown in external markets, and imports in connection with buoyant domestic demand. However, significant new export capacities have been built in recent years, and as their production picks up, the external balance is expected to improve quickly. In the Monetary Council's assessment, it is warranted to tighten the base rate further in a decisive manner in order to anchor inflation expectations and mitigate second-round inflation risks. The MNB continues to stand ready to respond quickly and flexibly by setting the interest rate on the one-week deposit instrument if warranted by the rise in short-term risks in financial and commodity markets. According to today's decision of the Monetary Council, the central bank base rate was raised by 100 basis points to 11.75 percent. The overnight deposit rate was increased by 100 basis points to 11.25 percent, and the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates were increased by 100 basis points to 14.25 percent. According to the Monetary Council's assessment, it is warranted to increase the interest rate on the one-week deposit instrument by the same measure as in the base rate. The Bank considers it crucial that short-term rates in every sub-market, particularly in the swap market, and at all times develop consistently with the level of interest rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. Therefore, the MNB has held swap tenders providing foreign currency liquidity since the beginning of July on a daily basis. With an active presence in the market, swap tenders improved the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission through an increase in swap rates, thereby supporting the achievement and maintenance of price stability. To enhance monetary transmission further, the Monetary Council decided to introduce three measures which will support the development of short-term financial market interest rates consistently with the Bank's policy stance in a turbulent period in financial markets by draining interbank liquidity from this autumn. The Bank will raise the required reserve ratio set for the banking system. Additionally, central bank discount bill auctions will be announced and held regularly. The Bank will also introduce a long-term deposit instrument in order to sterilise liquidity in the banking system at longer maturities than currently. The further rise in inflation and persistent inflation risks warrant the decisive continuation of the tightening cycle. The MNB continuously monitors developments in financial market risks as well and stands ready to intervene in a decisive manner using every instrument in its monetary policy toolkit, if necessary. Maintaining tighter monetary conditions for a longer period is warranted to manage increasing second-round inflation risks resulting from persistently negative supply effects. The Monetary Council will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes until the outlook for inflation stabilises around the central bank target in a sustainable manner and inflation risks become evenly balanced on the horizon of monetary policy."
Kazakhstan,2022-09-05,"The base rate remains unchanged at 14.5% September 5, 2022 Nur-Sultan The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to set the base rate at 14.5% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1.0 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities set on 15.5% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 13.5%. The decision was made taking into account the emerging economic situation, the balance of risks, as well as updated forecasts of the National Bank. The pressure from the external sector remains, which is caused by growth of the cost of logistics services, high inflation in the countries being the Kazakhstan's trading partners and weakening of the exchange rate of tenge against ruble. At the same time, global food prices are declining. Among the domestic drivers of price growth, fiscal stimulus should be singled out, which restrains the decline in food prices following the global markets and puts upward pressure on the demand side in the medium term. High inflation is driven by the ongoing adaptation of domestic prices to external price shocks, which at this stage does not require additional tightening of monetary conditions. In addition, the effect on the economy of a significant increase in the base rate since the beginning of 2022 has not yet fully manifested itself, and an appropriate assessment is needed to adjust measures in the future. The current level of the base rate is sufficient to ensure stability of the financial market and maintain the savings activity of economic entities. In August 2022, annual price growth accelerated to 16.1%. The growth of inflation is observed in all components: food products increased by 20.8%, non-food products - by 15.5%, paid services - by 10.1%. Among goods and services, the cost of a number of household goods, sugar, flour, cereals, pasta products, as well as housing rent increased. A decrease in prices is mainly observed for a wide range of fruit and vegetable products. Inflation expectations remain high. In August 2022, the median estimate of expected inflation was 16.5%. The percentage of respondents expecting the inflation rate to remain the same or increase in a year has risen to 55%. The risks of further development of global economy are worsening. According to IMF forecasts, the world economy will slow down from 6.1% in 2021 to 3.2% in 2022 and to 2.9% in 2023 (the previous IMF forecast for 2022-2023 was 3.6%). Forecasts for Kazakhstan's main trading partners (EU. China. Russia) for 2022-2023 are also worsened. External food inflation continues to decline. The FAO Food Price Index decreased by 1.9% in August 2022 (down 9% in July) due to a decrease in all components that make up the index. The decline in cereal prices was partly due to an agreement between Ukraine and the Russian Federation to unblock Ukraine's main Black Sea ports and the harvest in the northern hemisphere, which contributed to an increase in supply. In view of the good, according to the FAO, forecasts for the world harvest, the increase in the global supply of grain is expected to contribute to a further decline in prices. Global consumer inflation continues to be high. In the EU, annual inflation accelerated to 9.8% in July 2022. In the U.S., inflation slowed to 8.5% as a result of some decline in oil prices. IMF global inflation forecasts for 2022-2023 envisage faster price growth than previously expected. Oil prices are expected to remain high in the global oil market. According to the forecasts of international organizations, in the short term, due to high prices for gasoline and other energy sources, demand is likely to decline slightly. Oil production will gradually increase, but this effect will be offset by weaker oil production in Russia and the Middle East. In 2022. Brent crude oil prices are expected to average $105.3 per barrel, and $90.3 per barrel in 2023. Given these factors and projections, the baseline scenario assumes a trajectory of a gradual decline in the price of Brent from current levels to an average of $90 per barrel in 2023 and $85 per barrel in 2024. National Bank forecasts for economic growth in Kazakhstan in 2022 have been revised amid a slowdown in business activity. Based on the results of the current year. GDP dynamics will slow down to 2.5-3.5% amid the expected scheduled repairs at the major fields and the continuing uncertainty at the CPC. Positive contribution from all components of demand is expected. A significant contribution will be made by real exports amid the established high base of the first quarter and recovery of growth rates by the end of the year after some reduction in the second and third quarters of 2022. The medium-term estimates demonstrate strong export growth on the back of oil production growth in 2023-2024. An additional impetus will be the growing dynamics of consumer demand in the face of rising government spending. At the same time, high dynamics of imports, which will be a consequence of fiscal stimulus, will partly offset the growth of domestic demand. GDP growth is projected to accelerate to 4-5% in 2023. In 2024 GDP growth will be at the same levels. Given current assumptions, inflation is projected to be in the range of 16-18% by the end of 2022. This is higher than previous estimates of the National Bank. Food products will continue to make the main contribution to the growth of prices, taking into account the dynamics of prices on foreign and domestic food markets. Significant inflationary pressure will be observed against the background of positive fiscal impulse, high external inflation, weakening of tenge and restructuring of logistics and production chains. An additional factor is high, unanchored inflation expectations. In 2023 inflation will gradually slow down to 7.5-9.5%. Inflation will be restrained by a decline in the FAO grain index, the high base of inflation in 2022, and a faster than previously expected slowdown of inflation in Russia. In the absence of new external and internal shocks, inflation in 2024 will be in the range of 5.5-7.5%. The following decisions on the base rate will be made depending on the conformity of the actual dynamics of inflation to the forecasted trajectory and the emerging balance of risks in the external environment and the domestic economy. The next scheduled decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on October 24, 2022 at 14:00 (Nur-Sultan time)."
Chile,2022-09-06,"NoPtrae sds eR epleraesne s*a Tuesday, 6 September 2022 Monetary Policy Meeting  September 2022 At its monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 100 basis points, to 10.75%. The decision was adopted with the votes of Governor Rosanna Costa and Board members Alberto Naudon and Luis Felipe Cespedes. Vice‐Governor Pablo García voted for raising the MPR by 125 basis points, and Board member Stephanie Griffith‐Jones voted for raising it by 75 basis points. Global inflation has continued to rise and shows signs of increasing persistence. Central banks have further raised their benchmark rates. The European Central Bank began its monetary normalization process in July. The U.S. Federal Reserve has taken a more contractionary stance to control inflation. In this context, the global growth outlook has deteriorated, amid conditions that remain unfavorable, especially for emerging economies. Global financial markets have continued to show high volatility, mainly due to uncertainty regarding the Fed's monetary policy path and its impacts. In general, long‐term interest rates have risen in recent weeks and the dollar has continued to appreciate globally. The oil price has fallen back to around US$90 per barrel (13% since the last meeting), while copper, with ups and downs, is around US$3.5 per pound (+3% since the last meeting). Food prices have also shown significant declines. Since the Central Bank's intervention announcement, tensions in the forex market have eased. Volatility has decreased and the exchange rate has appreciated. Long‐term interest rates are at similar levels —with fluctuations— to those of the previous meeting, while the stock market has accumulated gains. Credit continues to be weak, in a context in which banks and businesses perceive financial conditions to be restrictive. Activity has continued its adjustment process after the strong imbalances accumulated in 2021. Data for the second quarter showed a 0.5% decline in non‐mining GDP —seasonally adjusted series— compared with the previous quarter. This trend continued in July, when the non‐mining Imacec decreased 0.8% monthly in its seasonally‐adjusted series. On the expenditure side, the second‐quarter data showed declines in both investment and consumption. The labor market has lost strength, with low job creation and a decrease in vacancies. The unemployment rate shows no big change. The annual change in real wages remains negative. Consumer and business confidence indicators are still in pessimistic territory. Headline inflation has continued on an upward path and stood at 13.1% annually in July, while core inflation —measured by the CPI without volatiles— rose to 10% annually. The July CPI data surprised to the upside, mainly driven by greater increases in volatile prices. Survey inflation expectations (EES and FTS)— have been adjusted upwards. With this decision, the MPR is at the maximum level considered in the central scenario of the September Monetary Policy Report. Future movements of the policy rate will depend on the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario and its implications for the convergence of inflation to the target. The Board will be especially vigilant of the upward risks for inflation, not only because of the high level it has reached but because inflation expectations two years ahead remain above 3%. The Monetary Policy Report that will be released tomorrow morning contains the details of the central scenario, its related sensitivities and risks, and its implications for the future path of the MPR. Nota de prensa The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be released at 8:30 hours of Thursday 22 September 2022. The next meeting will be held on Tuesday 11 and Wednesday 12 October 2022 and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours of this latter date. The Spanish original prevails.

Poland,2022-09-07,"Warsaw, 7 September 2022 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 7 September 2022 The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.25 percentage points, i.e. to 6.75%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: ▪ lombard rate at 7.25%; ▪ deposit rate at 6.25%; ▪ rediscount rate at 6.80%; ▪ discount rate at 6.85%. In 2022 Q2, annual GDP growth slowed down in major economies. At the same time, incoming data signal a deterioration of global economic conditions in 2022 Q3, although labour market situation in the largest advanced economies remains very good. Activity in the global economy and its prospects are under the negative impact of high prices of commodities and production components, disruptions in the functioning of global supply chains and the repercussions of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine. Meanwhile, there persists uncertainty regarding further impact of these shocks on economic conditions, including the impact of the situation in energy commodity markets on activity in the European economy in the coming quarters. Inflation in most economies continues to rise, reaching in many countries the highest levels in decades. At the same time, inflation forecasts for the coming quarters continue to be revised upwards. The main source of growing inflation continue to be high commodity prices, driven partly by the repercussions of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine, as well as persistent  despite signs of their gradual easing  disruptions in global supply chains. In some economies, rising prices are also driven by demand factors and increasing labour costs. As a consequence, core inflation is also increasing. Amidst a strong increase in inflation, many central banks continued to tighten their monetary policy in the recent period. In July 2022, the US Federal Reserve increased interest rates once again. In turn, the ECB increased interest rates for the first time since 2011. 1/3 In Poland  according to Statistics Poland preliminary estimate  GDP growth in 2022 Q2 amounted to 5.5% y/y, compared to 8.5% y/y in Q1. A slowdown in activity growth in year-on-year terms, resulted mainly from a significantly lower contribution of inventories to GDP growth and  to a much lesser degree  from slower consumption growth. At the same time, investment growth accelerated. Monthly data, including data on industrial production, construction and assembly output and retail sales, signal that economic activity growth, in year-on-year terms, in Q3 will also decelerate. A further slowdown of GDP growth is forecast for the coming quarters, while the economic outlook is subject to significant uncertainty. Despite weakening of economic conditions, labour market situation remains very good, which is reflected in a record low unemployment rate and in a further noticeable rise in wages. Inflation in Poland  according to Statistics Poland flash estimate  increased in August 2022 to 16.1% y/y. High inflation results mainly from an earlier strong rise in global energy and agricultural commodity prices  driven, to a large extent, by the repercussions of Russian military aggression against Ukraine  and earlier increases in regulated domestic tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy. Consequences of disruptions in global supply chains and passing by enterprises rising costs on to the final prices also boost inflation, simultaneously adding to higher core inflation. In turn, a curbing impact on inflation has been exerted by a reduction in some tax rates as part of the Anti-inflationary Shield. In the coming quarters, it is expected that the impact of factors currently amplifying price growth will persist, including those related to the Russian military aggression against Ukraine. Meanwhile, the NBP interest rates increases, fading of the impact of shocks currently boosting prices together with economic activity growth slowing down, will contribute to a gradual decline in inflation in the coming years. The decrease in inflation would also be supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council's assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy. The Council assessed, that there persists a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. In order to reduce this risk, i.e. striving to decrease inflation to the NBP target in the medium term, the Council decided to increase NBP interest rates again. The increase of the NBP interest rates will also curb inflation expectations. 2/3 Further decisions of the Council will depend on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy. NBP will take all necessary actions in order to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability, including above all to reduce the risk of inflation remaining elevated. NBP may intervene in the foreign exchange market, in particular to limit fluctuations of the zloty exchange rate that are inconsistent with the direction of monetary policy. The Council adopted the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2023."
Euroarea,2022-09-08,"Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. The Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points. This major step frontloads the transition from the prevailing highly accommodative level of policy rates towards levels that will ensure the timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. Based on our current assessment, over the next several meetings we expect to raise interest rates further to dampen demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. We will regularly re-evaluate our policy path in light of incoming information and the evolving inflation outlook. Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach. We took today's decision, and expect to raise interest rates further, because inflation remains far too high and is likely to stay above our target for an extended period. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, inflation reached 9.1 per cent in August. Soaring energy and food prices, demand pressures in some sectors owing to the reopening of the economy, and supply bottlenecks are still driving up inflation. Price pressures have continued to strengthen and broaden across the economy and inflation may rise further in the near term. As the current drivers of inflation fade over time and the normalisation of our monetary policy works its way through to the economy and price-setting, inflation will come down. Looking ahead. ECB staff have significantly revised up their inflation projections and inflation is now expected to average 8.1 per cent in 2022, 5.5 per cent in 2023 and 2.3 per cent in 2024. After a rebound in the first half of 2022, recent data point to a substantial slowdown in euro area economic growth, with the economy expected to stagnate later in the year and in the first quarter of 2023. Very high energy prices are reducing the purchasing power of people's incomes and, although supply bottlenecks are easing, they are still constraining economic activity. In addition, the adverse geopolitical situation, especially Russia's unjustified aggression towards Ukraine, is weighing on the confidence of businesses and consumers. This outlook is reflected in the latest staff projections for economic growth, which have been revised down markedly for the remainder of the current year and throughout 2023. Staff now expect the economy to grow by 3.1 per cent in 2022, 0.9 per cent in 2023 and 1.9 per cent in 2024. The lasting vulnerabilities caused by the pandemic still pose a risk to the smooth transmission of our monetary policy. The Governing Council will therefore continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic. The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website. A separate technical press release on the remuneration of government deposits will be published at 15:45 CET. I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. The euro area economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2022, mainly owing to strong consumer spending on contact-intensive services, as a result of the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions. Over the summer, as people travelled more, countries with large tourism sectors benefited especially. At the same time, businesses suffered from high energy costs and continued supply bottlenecks, although the latter have been gradually easing. While buoyant tourism has been supporting economic growth during the third quarter, we expect the economy to slow down substantially over the remainder of this year. First, high inflation is dampening spending and production throughout the economy, and these headwinds are reinforced by gas supply disruptions. Second, the strong rebound in demand for services that came with the reopening of the economy will lose steam in the coming months. Third, the weakening in global demand, also in the context of tighter monetary policy in many major economies, and the worsening terms of trade will mean less support for the euro area economy. Fourth, uncertainty remains high and confidence is falling sharply. At the same time, the labour market has remained robust, supporting economic activity. Employment increased by more than 600,000 people in the second quarter of 2022 and the unemployment rate stood at a historical low of 6.6 per cent in July. Total hours worked increased further, by 0.6 per cent, in the second quarter of 2022 and have surpassed their pre-pandemic levels. Looking ahead, the slowing economy is likely to lead to some increase in the unemployment rate. Fiscal support measures to cushion the impact of higher energy prices should be temporary and targeted at the most vulnerable households and firms to limit the risk of fuelling inflationary pressures, to enhance the efficiency of public spending and to preserve debt sustainability. Structural policies should aim at raising the euro area's growth potential and supporting its resilience. Energy price inflation remained extremely elevated, at 38.3 per cent, and it was again the dominant component of overall inflation. Market-based indicators suggest that, in the near term, oil prices will moderate, while wholesale gas prices will stay extraordinarily high. Food price inflation also rose in August, to 10.6 per cent, partly reflecting higher input costs related to energy, disruptions of trade in food commodities and adverse weather conditions. While supply bottlenecks have been easing, these continue to gradually feed through to consumer prices and are putting upward pressure on inflation, as is recovering demand in the services sector. The depreciation of the euro has also added to the build-up of inflationary pressures. Price pressures are spreading across more and more sectors, in part owing to the impact of high energy costs across the whole economy. Accordingly, measures of underlying inflation remain at elevated levels and the latest staff projections see inflation excluding food and energy reaching 3.9 per cent in 2022, 3.4 per cent in 2023 and 2.3 per cent in 2024. Resilient labour markets and some catch-up to compensate for higher inflation are likely to support growth in wages. At the same time, incoming data and recent wage agreements indicate that wage dynamics remain contained overall. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent, although recent above-target revisions to some indicators warrant continued monitoring. In the context of the slowing global economy, risks to growth are primarily on the downside, in particular in the near term. As reflected in the downside scenario in the staff projections, a long-lasting war in Ukraine remains a significant risk to growth, especially if firms and households faced rationing of energy supplies. In such a situation, confidence could deteriorate further and supply-side constraints could worsen again. Energy and food costs could also remain persistently higher than expected. A further deterioration in the global economic outlook could be an additional drag on euro area external demand. The risks to the inflation outlook are primarily on the upside. In the same way as for growth, the major risk in the short term is a further disruption of energy supplies. Over the medium term, inflation may turn out to be higher than expected because of a persistent worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy, further increases in energy and food prices, a rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than anticipated wage rises. However, if energy costs were to decline or demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices. Market interest rates have increased in anticipation of further monetary policy normalisation in response to the inflation outlook. Credit to firms has become more expensive over recent months, and bank lending rates for households now stand at their highest levels in more than five years. In terms of volumes, bank lending to firms has so far remained strong, in part reflecting the need to finance high production costs and inventory building. Mortgage lending to households is moderating because of tightening credit standards, rising borrowing costs and weak consumer confidence. Summing up, we raised the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points today, and expect to raise interest rates further, because inflation remains far too high and is likely to stay above our target for an extended period. This major step frontloads the transition from the prevailing highly accommodative level of policy rates towards levels that will support a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term inflation target."
Malaysia,2022-09-08,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to increase the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 2.50 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly increased to 2.75 percent and 2.25 percent, respectively. The global economy continued to expand, albeit at a slower pace, weighed down by rising cost pressures, tighter global financial conditions, and strict containment measures in China. However, global growth continues to be supported by improvements in labour market conditions, and the full reopening of most economies and international borders. Inflationary pressures have remained high, due to elevated commodity prices and tight labour markets, despite continued easing in global supply chain conditions. Consequently, central banks are expected to continue adjusting their monetary policy settings, some at a faster pace, to reduce inflationary pressures. In particular, aggressive adjustments in US interest rates have contributed to a strong US dollar environment. This has resulted in higher volatility in financial markets, affecting other major and emerging market currencies, including the ringgit. Going forward, the global growth is expected to face challenges from the impact of monetary policy tightening in most economies, and pandemic management measures in China. The growth outlook is subject to downside risks, including elevated cost pressures, the potential energy crisis in Europe, and sharp tightening in financial market conditions. For the Malaysian economy, the transition to endemicity and policy measures have contributed to the stronger growth performance in the second quarter of 2022. Going forward, indicators point to continued growth, underpinned by support from private sector spending. Labour market conditions and income prospects remain positive, with unemployment and underemployment declining further. The reopening of international borders will lift tourism-related sectors. Investment activity and prospects would be supported by the realisation of multi-year projects. Nevertheless, external demand is expected to moderate following softening global growth. Despite the increased volatility in the global financial and foreign exchange markets, these developments are not expected to derail Malaysia's growth. Domestic liquidity remains sufficient, with continued orderly functioning of the financial and foreign exchange markets. Financial institutions also continue to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers. These will ensure financial intermediation remains supportive of the economy. Going forward, downside risks to the domestic economy continue to stem from a weaker-than-expected global growth, further escalation of geopolitical conflicts, and worsening supply chain disruptions. Year-to-date, headline inflation has averaged at 2.8%. Headline inflation is projected to peak in 3Q 2022 before moderating thereafter, due to dissipating base effects and in line with the expected easing of global commodity prices. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to average closer to the upper end of the 2.0% - 3.0% forecast range in 2022, with some signs of demand-driven pressures amid the high-cost environment. The extent of upward pressures to inflation will remain partly contained by existing price controls, fuel subsidies, and the prevailing spare capacity in the economy. The inflation outlook, however, continues to be subject to domestic policy measures, as well as global commodity price developments arising mainly from the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and prolonged supply-related disruptions. With the positive growth prospects for the Malaysian economy remaining intact, the MPC decided to further adjust the degree of monetary accommodation. At the current OPR level, the stance of monetary policy continues to remain accommodative and supportive of economic growth. The MPC is not on any pre-set course and will continue to assess evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook to domestic inflation and growth. Any adjustments to the monetary policy settings going forward would be done in a measured and gradual manner, ensuring that monetary policy remains accommodative to support a sustainable economic growth in an environment of price stability.

Peru,2022-09-08,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT SEPTEMBER 2022 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 6.75% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 25 bps to 6.75 percent, thus continuing to normalize its monetary policy stance. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation decreased from 8.74 percent in July to 8.40 percent in August, above the target range, due to significant increases in international food and fuel prices. Core inflation fell from 5,44 percent in July to 5.39 percent in August, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The significant increase in international food and fuel prices since the second half of last year, accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in global inflation in magnitudes not seen in many years and towards levels significantly higher than the inflation targets of central banks, both in advanced and other economies in the region. A downward trend in year-on-year inflation is forecast with a return to the target range in the second half of next year, due to a moderation of the impact of international food and fuel prices, and to a reduction in inflation expectations. One-year-ahead expected inflation decreased from 5.16 to 5.10 percent between July and August, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Several leading indicators and expectations for economic activity recovered in August, but most remain pessimistic. The outlook for global economic activity this year and the next has deteriorated due to the expected unwinding of stimulus in advanced economies, international conflicts, and persistent global supply bottlenecks, despite some improvement in recent months. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants, including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, to consider changes in the monetary stance. The Board reaffirms its commitment to adopt necessary actions to ensure the return of inflation to the target range over the forecast horizon. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 4.75 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 7.25 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months and the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months. In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates based on the amount of the operations. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on October 6, 2022."
Ukraine,2022-09-08,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 25% per annum. Under current conditions, such level of the key policy rate is sufficient to maintain exchange rate stability and keep inflation processes under control. At the same time, in order to meet these goals, it is important to enhance monetary transmission and further improve the attractiveness of hryvnia assets, on which the NBU is currently working. Inflation continues to grow, but the growth is somewhat slower than forecast by the NBU. In July, inflation accelerated to 22.2% yoy. According to the NBU's preliminary estimates, it reached around 23% in August. The price growth was generally more moderate compared to the NBU's forecast (July 2022 Inflation Report). This was mainly driven by a faster-than-expected decline in fuel prices resulting from a decrease in global oil prices and setting up logistics inside Ukraine. Prices for some vegetables also grew slower, as was expected, in particular thanks to a seasonal increase in supply, which came mostly from households. However, the inflationary pressure remains high. Effects of the war, in particular the destruction of production facilities and disruption of logistics, still have a major impact on prices of almost all goods and services in the consumer basket. A worsening of inflation expectations is also pushing prices up. This is reflected, among other things, in high demand for durable goods and foreign currency. The inflation dynamics were also influenced by the correction of the official exchange rate of the hryvnia in July, which was driven by the need to maintain the resilience of the economy and the financial system over a longer term. Going forward, inflation processes will remain under control, in particular thanks to measures taken by the NBU and the government. Maintaining stability of the exchange rate remains an important precondition for stabilizing expectations and keeping inflation processes under control. A one-time correction of the hryvnia official exchange rate and additional measures taken by the NBU to ease the depreciation pressure helped reduce imbalances on the FX market. This is, in part, evidenced by lower volumes of NBU interventions to sell foreign currency in the past months. Coupled with large amounts of international financial assistance, it drove FX reserves up to USD 25.4 billion in August. Ukraine's international reserves are sufficient to keep the exchange rate fixed at the current level, taking into account the prospects of receiving the official financing from international partners, a gradual setting up of logistics, and a respective increase in export earnings. In the medium run, a gradual normalization of fiscal policy will help keep inflation under control. In particular, re-imposing import taxes in July increased the government's ability to finance wartime expenses from revenues. This eased pressures on international reserves and lowered the need for NBU to provide monetary financing: monthly volumes of budget monetization decreased to UAH 30 billion in July and August, down from UAH 105 billion in June. Fixing utility tariffs will remain and important factor in restraining inflation. Despite high global energy prices (natural gas and electricity), the prices will remain unchanged for households during the current heating season. The impact of this factor on inflation dynamics will thus be limited. Further growth in yields on hryvnia deposits and domestic government debt securities will also put the brakes on inflation processes. The National Securities and Stock Market Commission launching the secondary market of domestic government debt securities gave a strong impetus to the growth in yields. Increased attractiveness of hryvnia savings will allow reducing demand for foreign currency and durable goods. Progress in cooperation with international partners, including the IMF, is an important precondition for the stable functioning of the economy in wartime. By the end of the current year. Ukraine expects to receive declared official financing totaling about USD 12 billion (in the equivalent), including EUR 8 billion as macro-financial aid from the EU. Ongoing international support will enable the NBU to maintain international reserves at a sufficient level in the coming years. Extended full-scale war against Ukraine by russia remains the key risk for Ukraine's economic development. The speed at which the Ukrainian economy recovers and inflation returns to a slowing trajectory largely depend on when the active phase of the war ends. Other inflationary risks have decreased in the short term since the NBU Board made its key policy rate decision in July. However, they remain significant in the long-term. the Black Sea ports opened earlier for grain exports than the NBU had envisaged in its baseline scenario of the July macroeconomic forecast. The “Grain Agreement” makes it possible to increase export earnings beyond the NBU's forecast, which will have a positive effect on the foreign exchange market. However, the stability of sea exports remains vulnerable, particularly in the light of the latest statements made by the authorities of the aggressor country.the lack of progress in reimposing excise duties on fuel and introducing additional taxes on imports is putting less pressure on prices in the short term. At the same time, in the longer term, insufficient measures to limit imports and balance public finances through raising additional tax revenues pose risks to both fiscal stability and the country's ability to maintain control over inflation, as well as to macro-financial stability in general.the implementation of new financial support initiatives by the United States will increase Ukraine's international reserves in 2022 beyond the forecast, which will positively affect economic stability and expectations. Instead, the prospects for the non-monetary financing of the budget deficit in 2023 remain largely uncertain.the still low interest rates on hryvnia domestic government debt securities at primary auctions, in particular compared to secondary market yields, are significantly limiting government borrowing. This is restraining monetary transmission, while also dampening the growth in the attractiveness of hryvnia assets, increasing the sensitivity of the FX market to situational factors and risks to financial stability in the longer term.the rate of emigration remains higher than the NBU's assumptions, threatening to reduce the labor force and to produce long-term negative effects on the labor market and economic growth after the war. In view of the forecast inflation dynamics and the balance of inflation risks, the NBU Board decided to keep the key policy rate unchanged, at 25%. This decision is in line with the baseline scenario of the macroeconomic forecast, which envisages keeping the key policy rate at the current level at least until Q2 2024. At the same time, the NBU is working on measures to enhance monetary transmission and minimize the negative impact of the budget's monetary financing on inflation and the FX market. If required, the NBU stands ready to raise the key policy rate above its current level and to deploy additional measures to protect international reserves, as well as and to maintain control over inflation. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 25% per annum was approved by NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No. 450, dated 8 September 2022. A summary of the discussion between Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of the NBU Board's decision will be published on 19 September 2022. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 20 October 2022, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
Armenia,2022-09-13,"PRESS RELEASE 13.09.2022 Refinancing Rate Set at 10% At September 13, 2022 meeting, the CBA Board decided to raise the policy rate by 0.5 percentage points setting it at 10%. In August 2022, 12-month inflation decreased to 9.1% at the end of the month. 12-month core inflation continued to grow reaching 10.2%. In the third quarter of 2022, low economic growth and high inflation continued to sustain in the main partner countries of Armenia. The central banks of advanced countries will continue to conduct contractionary monetary policy. This will be reflected in the tightening of global financial conditions and in slowing of economic activity. Subsequently, a certain drop of prices will be observed in the international commodity markets, contributing to the gradual easing of the global inflationary environment. Hence, it is expected that inflationary effects from the external sector will subdue. During the third quarter of 2022, high economic activity continued to be observed in Armenia. It mostly is witnessed in services and construction sectors. Positive developments continue in the export sector as well. High economic growth is predominantly driven by the demand factors. Again, its main contributors are the significant influx of international visitors and remittances. High demand contributes to the expansion of the inflationary environment and persisting high inflationary expectations. In the current situation, the Board finds it appropriate to raise the policy rate. Relatively contractionary monetary policy and dram appreciation will gradually contribute to curbing demand and reducing inflationary expectations. The CBA Board is consistent in taking adequate actions to stabilize inflation and to offset any risk of deanchoring of inflation expectations and. In line with the outlined monetary policy scenario, the 12-month inflation will gradually decline and from the end of 2023, will stabilize around the 4% target. The CBA Board considers that the risks of inflation deviation from the projected trajectory are mainly balanced. Should the risks materialize in any direction, the Board stands ready to respond accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective. Detailed information on the basis for determining the interest rate can be found in the Inflation Report to be published by September 28, 2022 (in 2022. QIII Monetary Policy Report)."
Georgia,2022-09-14,"14.09.2022 THE NATIONAL BANK OF GEORGIA KEEPS ITS MONETARY POLICY RATE UNCHANGED AT 11.0 PERCENT On September 14, 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) decided to keep the monetary policy rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged. The monetary policy rate stands at 11.0 percent. Inflationary pressure is still quite high both in Georgia and in the rest of the world. The sanctions imposed against Russia and the additional supply-side disruption stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war have significantly raised international prices on food, energy and other commodities. Besides this, against the backdrop of consecutive shocks, inflation has long deviated from the target level, which further amplifies inflationary risks. However, recently some positive trends are observed on international markets. Brent oil prices and shipping costs continue to decline. Although remaining at a high level, the international food price index decreased on a monthly basis by 9.0 percent in July, and by 1.9 percent in August, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). It is expected that these trends will gradually be transmitted to the local market and favorably affecting the dynamics of inflation. As in the previous month, headline inflation maintained its downward trajectory and reached 10.9 percent in August. Signs of inflation deceleration give reasons for cautious optimism. Overall, under the influence of these factors and the strengthening of the GEL effective exchange rate compared to the previous year, inflation will tend to decline further both this and next year and other things equal will gradually approach the target level from the middle of 2023. However, future trends largely depend on geopolitical outlook. Therefore, monetary policy will remain tight until upward risks to inflation expectations are sufficiently mitigated. Should inflation expectations rise further and/or demand-side pressures on prices exacerbate, further tightening of policy or maintaining the current tight stance for a longer time period might become necessary. As for economic activity, according to the preliminary data, the average real GDP growth of the first seven months of 2022 was 10.3 percent. The main driver of this growth is a significant increase in tourism revenues. However, domestic demand is also strong, preventing a faster reduction in inflation. The strength of domestic demand is supported by a relatively high credit growth mainly caused by consumer and foreign currency loans, the slowdown of which can hardly be affected by increases in the monetary policy rate. Accordingly, in the recent period, along with the tightened monetary policy, the NBG used macroprudential instruments as well, which has already been reflected in the loan growth rate, and this effect will be strengthened in the future. In addition, it is expected that both already implemented and announced future interest rate hikes by the leading central banks will have an effect on FX lending in Georgia similar to monetary policy tightening. At the same time, as in case of the US dollar, the Monetary Policy Committee sets the remuneration of required reserves for funds attracted in euros fixed at 0 percent. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on October 26, 2022."
Russia,2022-09-16,"On 16 September 2022, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 50 basis points to 7.50% per annum. Current consumer price growth rates remain low, contributing to a further slowdown in annual inflation. This is due to both the influence of a set of one-off factors and subdued consumer demand. Developments in business activity are better than the Bank of Russia expected in July. However, the external environment for the Russian economy remains challenging, invariably putting significant constrains on economic activity. Inflation expectations of households and price expectations of businesses remain elevated. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, annual inflation will total 11.0-13.0% in 2022 and, given the monetary policy stance, drop to 5.07.0% in 2023, returning to 4% in 2024. Inflation movements. Current consumer price growth rates remain low, contributing to a further slowdown in annual inflation. Annual inflation declined in August to 14.3% (after 15.1% in July); according to a 9 September estimate, it is down to 14.1%. The decline in headline inflation is largely due to continued adjustment of prices for goods and services, after they went up sharply in March. This was supported by the dynamics of the ruble exchange rate and generally subdued consumer demand. An additional disinflationary factor was the expansion of supply in a number of goods markets as external and domestic export restrictions remained in place. However, the overall consumer price index in August, on a monthly seasonally adjusted basis, was decelerating slower, and core inflation went up slightly. Inflation expectations of households and businesses remain elevated. Analysts' medium-term inflation expectations are anchored close to 4%. Taking into account emerging trends in consumer prices, the Bank of Russia expects annual inflation to decline to 11.0-13.0% by the end of 2022. Annual inflation will continue to decline under the influence of base effects, among other things, despite the expected further increase in current rates of price growth. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will decline to 5.07.0% in 2023 and return to 4% in 2024. Monetary conditions continued to ease, and the Bank of Russia views them as overall neutral. Following the July decline in the key rate, yields on short- and medium-term OFZs decreased. Yields on long-term OFZs did not change significantly. There was a further drop in loan and deposit, especially short-term, rates. Despite the recent reduction in deposit rates, the inflow of household funds to credit institutions was overall continued. Household funds were placed into long-term ruble deposits and current accounts, and withdrawn from short-term ruble deposits. This reflects a normalisation in the structure of household savings with banks. Growth in corporate lending accelerated. A recovery was seen in unsecured consumer lending, alongside with significant growth in mortgage loans. Credit activity was supported by both government subsidised lending programmes and the key rate reduction that occurred in between April and July. Economic activity. The external environment for the Russian economy remains challenging and significantly constrains economic activity. Concurrently. Q2 GDP and high-frequency indicators point to stronger dynamics of business activity than the Bank of Russia expected in July. At the same time, trends across sectors and regions remain clearly mixed. Both demand and supply factors are making a certain negative impact on economic activity. Surveys suggest that a significant proportion of enterprises are still confronted by difficulties in production and logistics. However, their sentiment is continuing to improve as suppliers of finished products, raw materials and components diversify, as do sales markets. A growing number of enterprises are adjusting to the new environment. For all the recovery, consumer activity remains muted. This is due to the recent drop in real incomes of households as they maintain their propensity to save. Specifically, the latter factor is explained by, beyond overall economic uncertainty, the reduced supply of several types of goods and services. Having said that, supply-side constraints on consumer markets have slightly faded as consumer imports are gradually recovering and import substitution is taking place. The situation in the labour market remains stable in general. Although the number of vacancies has decreased, the unemployment rate is near historical lows. The adaptation of the labour market to the changed conditions largely occurs through the mechanism of part-time employment and the adjustment of real wages. According to the Bank of Russia, with regard to the current situation in the Russian and global economies, the decline in GDP in 2022 may be closer to the upper bound of the July forecast range (-6.0)—(-4.0)%. Inflation risks. There is a balance between proinflationary and disinflationary risks over a short-term horizon. Over a medium-term horizon, proinflationary risks still prevail. Risks for the baseline scenario are largely associated with the volatility of the ruble exchange rate, which is indicative of the changes in foreign trade flows, as well as the dynamics of inflation expectations. The disinflationary effect over a short-term horizon may be caused by the high propensity of households to save in the conditions of general economic uncertainty, the length of adaptation to the new structure of supply in consumer markets, and expectations of a further price downturn against the background of the strengthening of the ruble since the beginning of the year. Concurrently, the pass-through of the latter to prices may be longer. A good harvest of agricultural products in 2022 may be an additional disinflationary factor. An increase in supply in the domestic market of goods which are subject to export restrictions may also produce more pronounced disinflationary effects. Short-term proinflationary risks are caused by high and unanchored inflation expectations which are particularly sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations, as well as by the acceleration of consumer lending. Growth in consumer lending may be strengthened by the easing of banks' non-price requirements for borrowers and lower risk premiums in interest rates. If combined, these factors can lead to consumer demand outstripping the capacity to expand output. A further toughening of external trade and financial restrictions may also create significant proinflationary risks. They can lead to a greater reduction in the Russian economy's potential than expected in the baseline scenario. Supply-side constraints may in particular strengthen because of problems with the procurement of equipment, a slow replenishment of stocks of finished goods, raw materials and components in the event of intensifying negative trends in import dynamics. In turn, the materialisation of growing risks of a global recession may further weaken external demand for Russian exports and, as a result, provoke a weaker rouble. The movements of the economy and inflation largely depend on fiscal policy decisions. The Bank of Russia takes into account the decisions already made regarding the mid-term expenditure path of the federal budget and the fiscal system as a whole. In case of a further budget deficit expansion, tighter monetary policy may be required to return inflation to target in 2024 and keep it close to 4% further on. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 28 October 2022. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the medium-term forecast are to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. Statement by Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina in follow-up to Board of Directors meeting on 16 September 2022.

Brazil,2022-09-21,"In its 249th meeting, the Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's scenario:. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; the uncertainty about the country's future fiscal framework and additional fiscal stimuli that support aggregate demand, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset prices; and an output gap tighter than the currently adopted by the Committee in its reference scenario, especially in the labor market. Among the downside risks, it should be noted an additional reduction in the prices of international commodities measured in local currency; a greater than projected deceleration of global economic activity; and the continuity of tax cuts assumed to be reversed in 2023. The Committee assesses that the still uncertain and volatile current scenario requires serenity when evaluating risks. Considering the assessed scenarios, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and, to a lesser extent, 2024. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing economic fluctuations and fostering full employment. The Committee will remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets. The Committee reinforces that future monetary policy steps can be adjusted and will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto de Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Diogo Abry Guillen. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. The following members voted for a residual adjustment of 0.25 p.p: Fernanda Magalhaes Rumenos Guardado and Renato Dias de Brito Gomes. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Philippines,2022-09-21,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to raise the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility by 50 basis points to 4.25 percent, effective tomorrow, 23 September 2022. Accordingly, the interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were raised to 3.75 percent and 4.75 percent, respectively. The BSP's latest baseline forecasts show that average inflation is still projected to breach the upper end of the 2-4 percent target range at 5.6 percent in 2022. The forecast for 2023 has also increased slightly to 4.1 percent. Meanwhile, the forecast for 2024 eases to 3.0 percent. In deciding to raise the policy rate anew, the Monetary Board noted that price pressures continue to broaden. The rise in core inflation indicates emerging demand-side pressures on inflation. Moreover, second-round effects continue to manifest, with inflation expectations remaining elevated in September following the approved minimum wage and transport fare increases. Nonetheless, inflation expectations continue to be broadly anchored over the medium term. The risks to the inflation outlook remain tilted toward the upside until 2023 and broadly balanced in 2024. Price pressures may continue to emanate from the potential impact of higher global non-oil prices, pending petitions for further transport fare hikes, the impact of weather disturbances on prices of food items, as well as the sharp increase in the price of sugar. Meanwhile, the impact of a weaker-than-expected global economic recovery continues to be the main downside risk to the outlook. Given elevated uncertainty and the predominance of upside risks to the inflation environment, the Monetary Board recognized the need for follow-through action to anchor inflation expectations and prevent price pressures from becoming further entrenched. The domestic economy can accommodate a reasonable tightening of the monetary policy stance, as demand has generally held firm owing to improved employment outturns and ample liquidity and credit. At the same time, the Monetary Board also continues to urge the National Government to implement timely non-monetary interventions to mitigate the impact of persistent supply-side pressures on food and other commodity prices. The BSP reiterates its commitment to take all necessary actions to steer inflation towards a target-consistent path over the medium term, consistent with its primary mandate to promote price and financial stability."
United States,2022-09-21,"EDT September 21, 2022 Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Russia's war against Ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3 to 3-1/4 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT September 21, 2022inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Egypt,2022-09-22,"Press Release  September 22nd, 2022 MPC decided to keep key policy rates unchanged In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 1125 percent, 1225 percent, and 1175 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1175 percen. The CBE also decided to increase the required reserve ratio to 18 percent from 14 percen. This works as a catalyst, complementing the tightening stance that the CBE is maintaining, by calibrating liquidity condition. On the global front, forecasts for the global economic activity have dampened due to spillover effects from the conflict between Russia and Ukrain. Furthermore global financial conditions are expected to tighten further as major central banks continue to raise policy rates and reduce asset purchase programs with the aim of containing increased inflationary pressures in their respective countrie. In contrast, global commodity prices, such as international prices of oil, have slightly declined, as a result of weakening demand due to global recession expectation. Domestically economic activity has grown by a preliminary figure of 32 percent in 2022 Q2, implying that fiscal year 2021/22 registered a growth rate of 66 percent, compared to 33 percent in the previous fiscal yea. Latest available data for the first nine months of the fiscal year shows that GDP growth was mainly driven by the private sector, particularly non-petroleum manufacturing, tourism, and trad. Meanwhile public sector activity was supported by natural gas extractions. Suez Canal and the general governmen. Moreover select leading indicators continue to register positive growth rates in 2022 Q3. However, economic activity is expected to grow at a slower rate than previously projected, given the uncertainty and negative spillovers from the global scen. In the labor market, both employment and the labor force figures increased by similar magnitudes, therefore, the unemployment rate remained stable at 72 percent in 2022 Q. Annual headline urban inflation increased to 146 percent in August 2022 from 136 percent in July 202. Similarly annual core inflation - which excludes volatile food and regulated items - increased to 167 percent in August 2022 from 156 in July 202. The increase in annual inflation since the beginning of 2022 is emanating predominately from supply side issues particularly international commodity price. Despite rising annual figures, the recorded monthly rates are lower than the recent highs witnessed during March and April 202. Therefore the MPC concurs that the current key CBE rates coupled with the increased required reserve ratio are consistent with achieving price stability over the medium ter. Noting that the previous tightening policy rates by 300bps is still transmitting through the economy, the MPC will continue to assess the impact on inflation expectations and other macroeconomic developments over the medium ter. The elevated annual headline inflation rate will continue to be temporarily tolerated above the CBE's pre-announced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4. The CBE remains committed to achieving low and stable levels of inflation over the medium term which is a requisite condition towards sustainable economic growt. Moving forward, the MPC will keep monitoring the global and domestic conditions for further developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to achieve its price stability mandate over the medium ter. The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations rather than of prevailing inflation rate. Monetary Policy Sector monetarypolicy@cbeorge."
Turkiye,2022-09-22,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 13 percent to 12 percent. The weakening effects of geopolitical risks on global economic activity continue to increase. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards and recession is increasingly assessed as an inevitable risk factor. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the upward trend in producer and consumer prices continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and rigidities in labor markets. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. A strong growth was observed in the first half of 2022. Since the beginning of July, leading indicators have been pointing to a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand. Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues. On the other hand, high course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. In addition, the spread between policy rate and the loan interest rates driven by the announced macroprudential measures is closely monitored. The Committee will continue to further strengthen the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism. Increase in inflation is driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. Additionally, leading indicators for the third quarter continue pointing to loss of momentum in economic activity due to the decreasing foreign demand. It is important that financial conditions remain supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as escalating geopolitical risk. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to reduce the policy rate by 100 basis points, and has assessed that the updated level of policy rate is adequate under the current outlook. To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2022-09-22,"PRESS STATEMENT 22 September 2022 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and heightened geo-political tensions, the global economy has entered a period of persistently high inflation and weaker economic growth. Many developing economies exited the pandemic with less than full recovery and high debt levels. Russia's war in Ukraine continues to impair production and trade of a wide range of energy, food and other commodities. The supply of energy to the Euro Area is limited as winter approaches, placing immense strain on households, businesses and governments. With rapid inflation and monetary policy normalization, the United States may also experience slower economic growth. While China's recovery from the Covid- 19 lockdowns has strengthened, economic growth is expected to remain below longer- term trends. MPC Statement 22 September 2022 Page 1. MPC Statement 22 September 2022 Page 1 Taking these and other factors into account, the SARB's forecast for global growth in 2022 is revised down from 3.3% in the July meeting to 3.0%, and is lowered to 2.0% (from 2.5%) for 2023.1 Although policy settings in advanced economies remain accommodative, policy normalization has accelerated, and higher yields are tightening global financial conditions. Asset values in major markets have declined sharply, and investor appetite for riskier assets has weakened further. This year the SARB expects the South African economy to grow by 1.9%, (from 2.0%). Growth in the first quarter of this year surprised to the upside, at 1.7%. In the second quarter, flooding in Kwa-Zulu Natal and more extensive load-shedding contributed to a contraction of 0.7%. Growth in the third and fourth quarters is forecast to be 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. The economy is forecast to expand by 1.4% in 2023 and by 1.7% in 2024, above previous projections.2 Private investment has strengthened on the back of the recovery, but public sector investment remains weak. Household spending remains supportive of growth, but is likely to soften next year. Tourism, hospitality and construction should see stronger recoveries as the year progresses. 1 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. Global growth in 2024 is revised down to 2.4% from 2.5% at the time of the July meeting. The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) July forecast expected global growth of 3.2% in 2022 and 2.9% in 2023. An update to the World Economic Outlook will be released in October. 2 The growth forecast includes expected changes in the policy rate as given by the QPM. MPC Statement 22 September 2022 Page 2. MPC Statement 22 September 2022 Page 2 With a low rate of potential, our current growth forecast leaves the output gap broadly unchanged.3 The output gap is still expected to turn positive in the second quarter of 2023. After revisions, the risks to the medium-term domestic growth outlook are assessed to be balanced. While negative global shocks and loadshedding will continue to create headwinds to growth, household spending and investment are more supportive. Commodity price movements in recent months have been mixed. The export price of coal has increased alongside oil, while prices for metals have declined. While oil prices currently sit at around US$91 per barrel, we expect them to stay higher than we did in July, and to average US$105 per barrel for 2022. US$92 per barrel in 2023 and US$85 per barrel in 2024.4 South Africa's export commodity price basket has come down from earlier peaks and is now forecast to rise by 2.3% for the year as a whole (down from 3.2%), before falling in 2023 by about 17.6% and by a further 10.0% in 2024. As a result of these export and import developments, the current account balance is expected to register a surplus of 0.2% of GDP this year, falling to a deficit of 1.0% in 2023 and 1.6% in 2024.5 Although near term fiscal risk has eased on the back of better tax revenue, financing conditions for rand-denominated bonds have worsened. Ten-year bond yields currently trade at about 11.0%. 4 The Brent crude oil assumptions in July were US$108. US$92, and US$85, respectively. 5 In July, the current account surplus for 2022 was expected to be 2.0% of GDP, 0.4% in 2023 and -0.4% in 2024. MPC Statement 22 September 2022 Page 3. MPC Statement 22 September 2022 Page 3 Policy normalisation in major economies and the slowdown in China have contributed to rand depreciation in recent months. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R16.91 to the US dollar, compared with R16.10 at the time of the previous meeting.6 While economic growth is slowing globally, inflation continues to surprise to the upside. Sustained policy accommodation, supply shortages and other restrictions have sharply increased the prices of many goods, services and commodities.7 Producer price increases continue to pass-through to wages and consumer prices globally. Our estimate for inflation in the G3 is revised higher to 7.0% in 2022 (from 6.9%), up to 3.5% in 2023 (from 3.0%), and slightly higher at 2.1% in 2024.8 Since the previous meeting, the easing of global oil prices has contributed to a less aggressive rise in fuel price inflation for this year, at 33.7% (down from 38.8%). Further moderation in fuel price inflation is expected in 2023, averaging 1.7% (down from 5.7%). Local electricity price inflation is slightly lower at 10.9% in 2022, 8.9% in 2023, and is unchanged at 10% in 2024. Despite reduced global food price inflation, local food price inflation is revised up and is now expected to be 8.1% in 2022 (up from 7.4%). Food price inflation is revised lower to 5.6% (down from 6.2%) in 2023 and remains unchanged at 4.2% in 2024. The Bank's forecast of headline inflation for this year is unchanged at 6.5%. For 2023, headline inflation is revised lower to 5.3% (down from 5.7%), as a result of lower food, 6 The rand has depreciated by about 6.3% to the US dollar since the May meeting and 7.2% year to date. 7 The UN FAO food index declined sharply in July, falling by 8.6% month to month, largely on the back of an agreement to reopen Black Sea ports. Consequently, the assumption used for the forecast for USD- denominated world food prices in 2022 was revised lower from 22.3% to 17.8%. 8 The G3 comprises the United States, the Eurozone, and Japan. The latest CPI inflation in the respective components sits at 8.3%, 9.1% and 3.0%. MPC Statement 22 September 2022 Page 4. MPC Statement 22 September 2022 Page 4 fuel and core inflation forecasts for next year. Headline inflation of 4.6% is expected in 2024 (down from 4.7%). Our forecast for core inflation is unchanged at 4.3% in 2022, and lower than previously expected at 5.4% (down from 5.6%) in 2023. The forecast for 2024 is also slightly lower at 4.8% (from 4.9%). Services price inflation is broadly unchanged. Core goods price inflation however is forecast lower in each year, largely due to a lower starting point for vehicles and non-alcoholic beverages inflation.9 Average salaries are forecast to rise by less than at the time of the July meeting, at 5.1% in 2022, 6.7% in 2023 and 5.6% in 2024.10 The risks to the inflation outlook are assessed to the upside. While global producer price and food inflation has eased. Russia's war in the Ukraine continues, with adverse effects on global prices. Oil prices increased strongly from the start of the war, to around US$130 per barrel, and may rise again from today's level as stresses in energy markets intensify. Electricity and other administered prices continue to present clear medium-term risks. Given below-inflation assumptions for public sector wage growth and high petrol and food price inflation, considerable risk still attaches to the forecast for average salaries. Higher than expected inflation has pushed major central banks to accelerate the normalisation of policy rates, tightening global financial conditions and raising the risk profiles of economies needing foreign capital. G3 interest rate levels for the forecast 9 Core goods refers to total CPI goods excluding food and NAB, fuel and energy, whereas services include all surveyed services within the CPI basket. 10 Average salaries were expected to be 5.6%, 7.3%, and 5.7% at the time of the July meeting. MPC Statement 22 September 2022 Page 5. MPC Statement 22 September 2022 Page 5 period are now expected to be somewhat higher than in July.11 On balance, and with few exceptions, capital flows and market volatility will be elevated for emerging market assets and currencies. The rand depreciated by about 3.0% to the USD since the July meeting, and additional tightening of global conditions will present further risks to the currency. The risks to inflation identified over the past year have been realized, pushing up South Africa's headline inflation rate and inflation expectations. Average surveyed expectations of future inflation have increased to 6.5% for 2022 and 5.9% for 2023.12 Expectations for inflation based on market surveys have increased to 6.7%.13 Long- term inflation expectations derived from the break-even rates in the bond market have moderated slightly to about 7%.14 In the second quarter of this year, headline inflation breached the target range and is expected to remain above it until the second quarter of 2023. By the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect headline inflation to revert to the mid-point of the target range, on the back of declining fuel and food inflation. The forecast takes into account the policy rate trajectory indicated by the Bank's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM). As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting in response to new data and risks. 11 The weighted average of G3 policy rates is forecast to be 3.1% in 2023 (up from 3.0%) and 3.2% in 2024 (up from 3.1%). 12 For 2024, the BER survey of inflation expectations in Q3 moderated to 5.4% (from 5.6%). 13 Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) in September at the median expect inflation to be higher at 6.7% (from 6.5% in July) in 2022, 5.4% (5.0% from July) in 2023 and 4.6% in 2024 (4.4% from July). 14 Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These now sit at about 6.90% for the 5-year and 6.92% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year break-even inflation sits at 7.0%. MPC Statement 22 September 2022 Page 6. MPC Statement 22 September 2022 Page 6 Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 75 basis points to 6.25% per year, with effect from the 23rd of September 2022. Three members of the Committee preferred the announced increase. Two members preferred a 100 basis points increase. The level of the repurchase rate is now closer to the level prevailing before the start of the pandemic. The revised repurchase rate path remains supportive of credit demand in the near term, while raising rates to levels more consistent with the current view of inflation risks. The aim of policy is to anchor inflation expectations more firmly around the mid-point of the target band and to increase confidence of hitting the inflation target in 2024.15 Guiding inflation back towards the mid-point of the target band can reduce the economic costs of high inflation and enable lower interest rates in the future. Achieving a prudent public debt level, increasing the supply of energy, moderating administered price inflation and keeping wage growth in line with productivity gains would enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy. Economic and financial conditions are expected to remain more volatile for the foreseeable future. In this uncertain environment, monetary policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. The MPC will seek to look through temporary price shocks and focus on potential second round effects and the risks of de-anchoring inflation expectations. The Bank will continue to closely monitor funding markets for stress. 15 The forecasted trajectory for the repurchase rate implies a rise in the inflation-adjusted repo rate from -1.7% for 2021 to -1.7% for 2022, 1.4% for 2023, and 2.2% in 2024. The real repurchase rate calculation here is based on the 1-quarter ahead inflation forecast and are annual average rates. MPC Statement 22 September 2022 Page 7.

Hungary,2022-09-27,"At its meeting on 27 September 2022, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 28 September 2022:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. The risk of recession in the global economy has increased due to the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and the European energy crisis. High commodity prices and the drought in Europe may push inflation up further over the short term; however, the first signs of a turnaround have appeared. Growing recession risks, alongside falling commodity and energy prices and transport costs, points to a moderation in global inflation from 2023. Investor sentiment has deteriorated in general. Risk appetite has been driven by news on the war, expectations for interest rate increases by the world's leading central banks, concerns caused by persistently high inflation and fears of recession. Global prices of most commodities have fallen recently but remained at high levels. Gas futures prices have fallen since September, exhibiting considerable volatility. The US dollar continued to appreciate against the currencies of both developed and emerging economies. Both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank raised interest rates by 75 basis points in September. Meanwhile. CEE central banks have begun to slow or halt their cycle of interest rate hikes started well before those of the world's leading central banks. The Polish central bank raised its base rate by 25 basis points in September and rendered additional steps conditional upon incoming data. The Czech central bank stopped tightening interest rate conditions in August, and the Romanian central bank raised its policy rate by 75 basis points, by a lesser extent than expected by the market. In the first half of 2022, the Hungarian economy grew strongly; however, high-frequency data indicate a clear economic slowdown since the beginning of June. Industrial production and construction output increased on a year-on-year basis in July. Retail turnover stagnated after monthly decreases experienced since April. However, the global economic slowdown and the effects of high energy prices are increasingly reflected in a general deterioration in sentiment indicators. The time profile and structure of domestic GDP growth have been characterised by strong duality in 2022. The rate of annual economic growth is likely to slow significantly in the second half of the year. The components of domestic demand are expected to contribute to growth throughout this year. By contrast, net exports are likely to hold back the expansion. In 2023, household consumption will decrease. Rising costs and more uncertain demand prospects will reduce corporate investments, while the rescheduling of public development projects will also restrain investment activity. Net exports are expected to make a positive contribution to GDP growth again from the end of 2023 as external markets and supply chains recover. In August 2022, annual inflation was 15.6 percent and core inflation stood at 19.0 percent. Inflation rose by 1.9 percentage points, mainly due to an increase in food prices. Processed food prices were the main contributing factor to the increase in core inflation. The rise in producer prices has almost completely passed through to retail prices. Inflation expectations are at elevated levels. Inflation is expected to rise further in the autumn months, mainly due to factors outside the scope of monetary policy. The exceptional drought, the price explosion in energy markets and changes in official energy price regulations have all caused a short-term rise in inflation. The extension of measures aimed at capping prices until 1 January 2023 is likely to restrain price increases until the end of the year. The easing of external inflationary pressures and the downward pressure on prices, resulting from slowing demand, is expected start feeding through to domestic inflation from early 2023, leading to a slow turnaround in price growth. The expected decline in freight costs, commodity and energy prices based on futures prices, as well as the slowdown in global economic growth will all have a downward effect on external inflation. At the same time, declining consumer demand has an increasingly strong constraining effect on companies' pricing decisions. Tight monetary conditions help to avoid second-round inflationary effects and anchor inflation expectations. The consumer price index may average between 13.514.5 percent in 2022. Domestic inflation will decrease slowly in the first half of 2023, and then more significantly from the middle of the year. The consumer price index will return to the central bank tolerance band in the first half of 2024. The measures announced by the Government and their implementation are expected to ensure the achievement of this year's budget deficit target indicated by the Ministry of Finance. Thus, the government debt-to-GDP ratio will decrease to close to 76 percent of GDP by the end of 2022. The current account deficit is expected to continue rising temporarily in 2022 due to the import-increasing effect of high energy prices. Apart from the deterioration of the energy balance, an overall improvement can be observed in other items of the balance of payments. By 2024, with the normalisation of the global economic environment and the pick-up of the production of significant new export capacities built in recent years, the external balance position is expected to improve rapidly and significantly. The Monetary Council reviewed real economic and financial market developments, as well as the past and potential future outcomes of the cycle of interest rate hikes. Based on these, the Council decided to make a decisive interest rate step in September. According to today's decision of the Monetary Council, the central bank base rate was raised by 125 basis points to 13.00 percent. The overnight deposit rate was increased by 125 basis points to 12.50 percent, and the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates were increased by 125 basis points to 15.50 percent. According to the Monetary Council's assessment, it is warranted to increase the interest rate on the one-week deposit instrument by the same measure as in the base rate. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank was among the first institutions to start the tightening of monetary conditions, raising the base rate by over 12 percentage points since June 2021. With this, interest rate conditions have become sufficiently strict. The tightening of monetary conditions continues with the tightening of liquidity. From October 1, the MNB will significantly reduce forint liquidity by raising the required reserve ratio, holding central bank discount bond auctions regularly and launching a longer-term deposit instrument. In addition, the MNB also increases the effectiveness of monetary transmission through increases in swap yields using tenders providing foreign currency liquidity held on a daily basis. These measures will tighten monetary conditions even further, so the disinflationary effect of the previous base interest rate hikes will increase considerably. The Monetary Council deems that the risk distribution around the inflation projection of the September Inflation Report has become symmetrical. The alternative scenarios assuming the possibility of slowing global economic activity and a larger reversal in energy and commodity prices imply lower inflation than the baseline, and the scenarios assuming energy and commodity prices remaining at higher levels and strengthening second-round inflationary effects point to higher inflation. Overall, the growth risks point to a lower GDP trajectory. In the Monetary Council's assessment, by the current level of the base rate, interest rate conditions have become sufficiently strict, which ensures the achievement of the inflation target. The Monetary Council has decided to stop the cycle of base rate hikes after the step in September. Tight monetary conditions will be maintained over a prolonged period, which will ensure that inflation expectations are anchored and the inflation target is achieved in a sustainable manner. Looking ahead, tightening liquidity and further enhancing monetary transmission will be in the MNB's focus, for which the central bank may decide on additional measures in the future."
Nigeria,2022-09-27,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 144 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON MONDAY 26th AND TUESDAY 27th SEPTEMBER, 2022 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 26th and 27th of September 2022, amidst continued weakening of the global economy due largely to the lingering disruptions to the global supply chain as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war, persisting global inflationary pressure, and lockdowns in China. Other contributing factors include tightening global financial conditions, declining global trade, and increasing risks of a financial meltdown owing to the burgeoning global private and public debt portfolios. The Committee reviewed these and other developments in the global and domestic economies in the third quarter of 2022 as well as the outlook for the rest of the year. All (12) members of the Committee attended this meeting. Global Economic Developments The Committee expressed concern over the heightened risk of spillovers associated with the broadly weakening global recovery. These have been further exacerbated by uncertainties emanating from lingering supply chain bottlenecks, due to the Russia-Ukraine war and continued COVID-19 lockdown in China. Consequently global trade maintained a steady decline while inflation remained unabating despite aggressive rate hikes by several central banks. The risk of yet another global recession would be extremely damaging for fragile economies still confronted with the lag impact of the 2020 recession, especially for emerging market and developing economies currently confronted with huge capital flow reversals and tightening global financial conditions. CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall Consequently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its July 2022 growth forecast, further downgraded global output growth for 2022 and 2023 to 32 and 29 per cent, respectively, from 36 per cent apiece. In the Advanced Economies, inflation remains high and considerably above the long-run objectives of several central banks' threshold despite progressive rate hikes, due largely to persistent increase in the prices of food and energy. In major Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs), the uptrend in inflation is expected to continue in the medium term, driven by legacy structural issues, elevated exchange rate pressures, rising capital flow reversals, in addition to the outlined shocks from the global economy. In global financial markets, investors have continued to rebalance their portfolios as yields on fixed income securities improve with the ongoing policy rate increases. Gold price is thus gradually declining, as investors move steadily towards the fixed income market. In addition, risk-averse portfolio investors have continued with reassignment of their portfolios from perceived risky emerging market securities to less risky advanced economy securities. Domestic Economic Developments According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 354 per cent (year-on-year) in the second quarter of 2022, compared with 311 per cent in the first quarter of 2022 and 501 per cent in the corresponding quarter of 2021. The economy has thus maintained continuous growth for seven consecutive quarters, following its exit from recession in 2020. This consistent positive performance was driven largely by the sustained growth in the non-oil sector, particularly services and agricultural sub- sectors, supported by continued policy interventions, as well as credit expansion to the private sector. CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall While output growth remains positive, the Committee, was concerned about the contraction in economic activities, as indicated by the Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which fell to 472 index points in August 2022, below the 50-index point benchmark, compared with 504 and 519 index points in July and June 2022, respectively, an indication of weakening output growth. The contraction was attributed to a decline in production levels, new orders, inventory levels, employment levels and persisting shocks from the global economy associated with both the Russia-Ukraine war and the unabating Pandemic, as well as other domestic shocks. The Committee, however, expressed optimism on the economy's recovery in the short to medium term in view of the unwavering support by both the monetary and fiscal authorities in Nigeria. The Committee noted the continued uptrend in inflation for the seven consecutive months, with headline inflation (year-on-year) rising to 2052 per cent in August 2022, from 1964 per cent in July. Both the food and core components rose to 2312 and 1720 per cent in August 2022, from 2202 and 1626 per cent in July 2022, respectively. The hike in energy prices, such as rising price of Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), hike in electricity tariff, as well as the perennial scarcity of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) contributed significantly to the building of expectations, thus pushing up the cost of transportation and production. Other contributory factors include: the broad-based insecurity across the country, which continue to dampen production activities; legacy structural factors such as the inadequate state of critical infrastructure; high cost of importation of essential grains, such as wheat; and increased demand for money associated with the forthcoming electoral campaign season. The ongoing monetary policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve Bank is also putting upward pressure on local currencies across the world, with pass-through to domestic prices, as investors exit these economies to seek higher yields in US dollar denominated fixed income securities. CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall The Committee noted that broad money supply (M3) grew by 1105 per cent in August 2022, compared with 866 per cent in July. This was driven largely by the growth in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of 2619 per cent in July 2022, compared with 2278 per cent in the preceding month. The sustained growth in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) was driven largely by increased claims on the Federal government and other financial corporations and the private sector. Money market rates continued to fluctuate, reflecting liquidity conditions in the banking system. Consequently the monthly weighted average Open Buyback (OBB) rate declined to 1321 per cent in August 2022, from 1415 per cent in July, while the Inter-bank Call rate increased to 1500 per cent in August 2022, from 1300 per cent in July. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and the Liquidity Ratio (LR) remained above their prudential limits at 134 and 401 per cent, respectively, in August 2022. The Committee, applauded the improvement in the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio to 48 per cent in August 2022, compared with 50 per cent in June 2022, reiterating its call on the Bank to sustain its tight prudential regime, to ensure that the NPL ratio is kept below its 5 0 per cent prudential benchmark. The MPC noted the development in the equities market in the review period, as the All-Share Index (ASI) decreased to 49,,83651 index points on August 31, 2022, from 51,,81759 index points on June 30, 2022. Market Capitalization (MC) also decreased to ₦2688 trillion, from ₦2794 trillion in the same period. The bearish performance reflected sustained profit taking and sell-off by investors rebalancing their portfolios in favour of higher yields in the fixed income market. The Committee noted the marginal increase of 039 per cent in the level of external reserves to US$3846 billion at end-August 2022 from US$3831 billion at end-July 2022 despite continued demand pressure. With crude oil price forecast to continue to moderate in the short to medium term. Members urged the Bank not to relent on the various policies put in place to support non-oil exports to shore up external reserves. CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall Under the Real Sector Facility, the Bank released the sum of ₦6699 billion to 12 additional projects in manufacturing and agriculture. Cumulative disbursements under the Real Sector Support Facility (RSSF) currently stood at ₦210 trillion disbursed to 426 projects across the country. Furthermore under the 100 for 100 Policy on Production and Productivity (PPP), the Bank disbursed the sum of ₦2017 billion to 14 projects in healthcare, manufacturing, and services, bringing the cumulative disbursement under the facility to ₦9339 billion to 62 projects. In the healthcare sector, ₦400 billion was disbursed to two healthcare projects under the Healthcare Sector Intervention Facility (HSIF), bringing the cumulative disbursement to ₦13054 billion for 131 projects, comprising of 32 pharmaceuticals, 60 hospitals and 39 other services. Under the Export Facilitation Initiative (EFI), the Bank funded several commodity projects in the non-oil export segment for value-addition and production to the tune of ₦324 billion, aside the ₦5000 billion disbursed through the Nigerian Export Import Bank (NEXIM). In the Micro. Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) sector, the Bank supported entrepreneurship development with the sum of ₦3926 million under the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES), bringing the total disbursement under this intervention to ₦33243 million. Under the Intervention Facility for the National Gas Expansion Programme (IFNGEP), the Bank disbursed ₦100 billion to support the adoption of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) as the preferred fuel for transportation and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) as the preferred cooking fuel. Outlook The broad outlook of the global and domestic economies in the medium-term remains clouded by uncertainties associated with lingering headwinds from the Russia-Ukraine war and the residual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Others include tightening global financial conditions with elevated shocks to foreign capital flows, as some Advanced Economies continue to pursue aggressive 5 CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall policy rate hikes; the high level of corporate and public debt with heightened risk of another global financial meltdown; and the high level of inflation across several economies. On the domestic front, available data on key macroeconomic variables indicate that output growth will continue for the rest of 2022, however, at a much-subdued pace. Some of these domestic shocks include: the high level of insecurity currently disrupting the free flow of economic activities; heightened sovereign risk as the 2023 general elections approach; continued upward pressure on inflation, driven by exchange rate pressures amongst other domestic factors. In addition, domestic price development is expected to maintain the current upward trend in light of the build-up of increased spending and demand for money, as the 2023 general elections approach. Accordingly the Nigerian economy is forecast to grow in 2022 by 352 per cent (CBN), 420 per cent (FGN) and 340 per cent (IMF). The Committee's Considerations At this meeting the focus of the MPC was on the aggressive acceleration of inflation globally and how this had begun to retard growth in both Advanced and Emerging Market Economies. Members noted that though the global economy was progressively weakening due to the various headwinds confronting the recovery. In Nigeria, output growth had been sustained as a result of the combination of development finance interventions by the Bank and fiscal stimulus by the Federal Government. Members noted that in the last 3 years, the CBN has injected over N9 trillion into the economy, in addition to offering 2- year moratorium for 10-year long-term loan facilities. The Committee believe that these interventions have significantly helped engendered growth. However in light of the persisting pressures on inflation, the Committee encouraged the Bank maintain a close watch on the inflationary implications of the interventions. CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall The MPC noted the moderate downturn in the equities market, attributing it to a continued outflow of portfolio capital as investors re-assign their portfolios to more attractive US dollar denominated fixed income securities. The Committee, however, also called on the Federal Government to continue to improve the ease of doing business in Nigeria to retain the current patronage of foreign investors through sustained investor confidence in the Nigerian economy. The MPC applauded the Bank for its continued stringent regulatory measures over the banking system, noting the progressive decline in the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio of the banking system despite the heightened macroeconomic uncertainties. The MPC was concerned that within a four-month period, inflation had accelerated aggressively by 280 basis point from 1771 per cent in May 2022 to 2052 per cent in August 2022. The Committee was thus, of the view that given the primacy of its price and monetary stability mandate, it was expedient that significant focus must be given to taming inflation. The Committee was therefore of the view that a hold or loosen option was not in consideration at this meeting. This is also because a loosening will further widen the negative real interest rate gap and worsen the financial market conditions, as savings mobilization and investment inflows would decline further. It was also of the view that with the aggressive policy normalization in Advance economies, loosening the stance of policy would result in a sharp depreciation of exchange rate, leading to further hike in capital outflows. As regards a hold decision, this would mean a continuous deterioration in real earnings of fixed income earners and the livelihood of middle- and low-income households. The MPC noted that a tight policy stance would help consolidate the impact of the last two policy rate hikes, which is already reflecting in the slowing growth rate of money supply in the economy. It also felt that an aggressive rate hike 7 CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall would slow capital outflows and likely attract capital inflows and appreciate the naira. The Committee's Decision Members deliberated on the impact of the widening margin between the current policy rate of 14 per cent and the inflation rate of 2052 per cent. At this Meeting, the option to loosen the policy rate was not considered as this would be gravely detrimental to reining-in inflation. The Committee thus, agreed unanimously to raise the policy rate to narrow the negative real interest rate gap and rein-in inflation. The Committee thus voted unanimously to raise the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) and the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR). Ten members voted to raise the MPR by 150 basis points, one member by 100 basis points, and another member by 50 basis points. Ten Members voted to increase the CRR by 500 basis points, while two Members voted to increase CRR by 750 basis points. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Raise the MPR to 155 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; III. Increase the CRR to a minimum of 325 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 300 per cent. Thank you.

Thailand,2022-09-28,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 5/2022 Mr. Piti Disyatat. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 28 September 2022 as follows. The Committee votes unanimously to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 075 to 100 percent, effective immediately. The Thai economic recovery has continued to gain traction, driven mainly by tourism and private consumption. Headline inflation remains at a high level as cost pass-through has increased in the recent period despite declining commodity prices. The overall growth and inflation outlook is consistent with the previous assessment. The Committee deems that a gradual policy normalization remains an appropriate course for monetary policy, and thus votes to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point at this meeting. The Thai economy is projected to continue growing at 33 percent in 2022 and 38 percent in 2023, driven mainly by tourism and private consumption. The tourism sector recovers faster than expected as the number of foreign tourists continues to rise. Moreover the economic recovery has become more broad-based, both in terms of business sectors, especially services, and in terms of income distribution. Meanwhile the slower-than- expected global economy has an impact on Thai exports but would not derail the overall economic recovery. Headline inflation is expected to be at 63 percent in 2022 before declining to 26 percent in 2023 due to falling global oil prices and gradual easing of supply chain bottlenecks. Core inflation is projected to be at 26 percent in 2022 and 24 percent in 2023, rising more than previously assessed mainly on the back of higher cost pass-through. Wages have increased in some sectors and areas with labor shortages, but there have not been signs of a broad-based wage increase. Furthermore demand-side inflationary pressures are limited as the Thai economy is still in a recovery stage. Meanwhile medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range. The Committee will continue to closely monitor risks to inflation, especially a potential increase in cost pass-through, should businesses face rising cost pressures from multiple sources simultaneously. Overall financial system remains resilient. Commercial banks have high levels of capital and loan loss provision. Debt serviceability of households and businesses has improved in line with the economic recovery. However SMEs in some sectors have yet to fully recover and some low-income households are still sensitive to the rising living costs. The Committee views that financial institutions should continue to press ahead with debt 2 restructuring and deems it important to have targeted measures and sustainable solutions in place for vulnerable groups. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative. Government bond yields have gradually increased, while overall funding costs remain conducive for business financing. The depreciation of the baht against the US dollar has been rapid and continuous due to the strengthening of the US dollar but is still in line with regional currencies. The Committee will continue to closely monitor developments in the financial and exchange rate markets, especially in the period of heightened volatilities. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee judges that the Thai economy will continue to recover but with increased inflation risks. The policy rate should be normalized in a gradual and measured manner to the level that is consistent with sustainable growth in the long term. The Committee is ready to adjust the size and timing of policy normalization should the growth and inflation outlook shift from the current assessment."
Colombia,2022-09-29,"This press release details the aspects considered by the Board of Directors in its meeting on 29 September 2022. Six Board Members voted in favor of this decision and one member voted for a 50-bp increase. In its policy discussion, the Board considered the following elements:p>. Headline inflation in August stood at 10.8%, above the 9.9% annual figure expected by the technical staff. Core inflation (excluding food and regulated items) maintained a higher-than-estimated upward trend, reaching 6.9% per year in that month. Medium-term inflation expectations increased, posting far from the 3.0% target. As for economic analysts. Banco de la Republica's monthly survey showed that between August and September, inflation expectations for the end of 2023 raised from 5.5% to 6.3%, according to the median of the sample. The pace of economic activity remained dynamic in the second quarter. Based on this, the technical staff increased the GDP growth forecast for 2022 from 6.9% to 7.8%. For the coming months, there are signs of a slowdown in the country's productive activity. The technical staff revised its growth forecast for 2023 from 1.1% to 0.7%. Monetary policy in developed countries has become more contractionary than expected, reflected in a deterioration of global financial conditions and a significant depreciation of the Colombian peso and other currencies. Fears of a global recession have increased, thus inducing reductions in commodity prices. With the decision adopted in today's session, the Board of Directors continues the monetary policy adjustment process that ensures a return to the 3.0% inflation target in the medium term. To this end, it will make the decisions it deems necessary, based on new information available. Fecha de publicacion."
Mexico,2022-09-29,"Timely indicators suggest that world economic activity has continued decelerating during the third quarter. Global inflation continued increasing in an environment where imbalances between demand and supply in several markets and high levels of food and energy prices persist. This continues generating expectations of an accelerated monetary tightening worldwide and of reference rates at elevated levels for an extended period. Financial conditions remained tight while the dollar continued gaining strength. In its latest monetary policy decision, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points for a third consecutive time and anticipated future adjustments. Job creation in that country remained strong, and although inflation continued decreasing moderately, it is still at high levels. In turn, a large number of other central banks have continued raising their reference rates, some of them by higher-than-foreseen magnitudes. Among key global risks are those associated with the pandemic, the persistence of inflationary pressures, the intensification of geopolitical turmoil, and greater adjustments in economic, monetary and financial conditions. In domestic financial markets, the peso remained stable, while interest rates of government bonds increased throughout the entire yield curve. The rate of growth of economic activity during the third quarter is expected to slow down relative to that observed during the first half of the year, although slack conditions are expected to continue decreasing. An environment of uncertainty prevails, while the balance of risks for economic activity remains biased to the downside. The accumulated inflationary pressures associated with both the pandemic and the military conflict continue affecting headline and core inflation, which in the first half of September registered annual rates of 8.76% and 8.27%, respectively, thus remaining at levels unseen in two decades. Their expectations for 2022 and 2023 rose again, while those for the medium term adjusted slightly upwards, and those for the long term remained stable, although above the target. In view of greater-than-anticipated inflationary shocks and an outlook that their effects will take longer to dissipate, forecasts for headline and core inflation were revised upwards for the entire forecast horizon. In this complex environment, inflation is projected to converge to the 3% target in the third quarter of 2024 (see Table). These projections are subject to risks. On the upside: persistence of core inflation at high levels; external inflationary pressures associated with the pandemic; greater pressures on agricultural and livestock product prices and on energy prices due to the ongoing geopolitical conflict; exchange rate depreciation; and cost-related pressures. On the downside: a greater-than-anticipated slowdown in world economic activity; a decline in the intensity of the geopolitical conflict; a better functioning of supply chains; a greater-than-expected effect from the negative output gap; and a larger-than-anticipated effect from the Policy Program to Fight Inflation and High Prices (PACIC, for its 1 Spanish acronym). The balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon remains biased significantly to the upside. The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the evolution of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process. It also considered the increasing challenges for monetary policy stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of significant uncertainty, the inflationary pressures accumulated as a result of the pandemic and the geopolitical conflict, as well as the possibility of greater effects on inflation. Based on these considerations, and with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 75 basis points to 9.25%. With this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon. The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations. This, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times, with both the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets. The Board will assess the magnitude of the upward adjustments in the reference rate for its next policy decisions based on the prevailing conditions. 2/ Forecast starting August 2022.

India,2022-09-30,"Monetary Policy Statement, 2022-23 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) September 28-30, 2022 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (September 30, 2022) decided to: Increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 50 basis points to 5.90 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 5.65 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.15 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Global economic activity is weakening under the impact of the protracted conflict in Ukraine and aggressive monetary policy actions and stances across the world. As financial conditions tighten, global financial markets are experiencing surges of volatility, with sporadic sell-offs in equity and bond markets, and the US dollar strengthening to a 20-year high. Emerging market economies (EMEs) are facing intensified pressures from retrenchment of portfolio flows, currency depreciations, reserve losses and financial stability risks, besides the global inflation shock. As external demand deteriorates, their macroeconomic outlook is becoming increasingly adverse. Domestic Economy 3. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew year-on-year (y-o-y) by 13.5 per cent in Q1:2022-23. While all constituents of domestic aggregate demand expanded y-o-y and exceeded their pre-pandemic levels, the drag from net exports provided an2 offset. On the supply side, gross value added (GVA) rose by 12.7 per cent in Q1:2022-23, with all constituents recording y-o-y growth and most notably, services. Aggregate supply conditions are improving. With the south-west monsoon rainfall 7 per cent above the long period average (LPA) as on September 29 and its spatial distribution spreading to some deficit areas, kharif sowing has been catching up. Acreage was 1.7 per cent above the normal sown area as on September 23 and only 1.2 per cent below last year's coverage. The production of kharif foodgrains as per first advance estimates (FAE) was 3.9 per cent below last year's fourth advance estimates (only 0.4 per cent below last year's FAE). Activity in industry and services sectors remains in expansion, especially the latter, as reflected in purchasing managers indices (PMIs) and other high frequency indicators. The index of industrial production growth, however, slowed to 2.4 per cent (y-o-y) in July. On the demand side, urban consumption is being lifted by discretionary spending ahead of the festival season and rural demand is gradually improving. Investment demand is also gaining traction, as reflected in rising imports and domestic production of capital goods, steel consumption and cement production. Merchandise exports posted a modest expansion in August. Non-oil non-gold imports remained buoyant. CPI inflation rose to 7.0 per cent (y-o-y) in August 2022 from 6.7 per cent in July as food inflation moved higher, driven by prices of cereals, vegetables, pulses, spices and milk. Fuel inflation moderated with reduction in kerosene (PDS) prices, though it remained in double digits. Core CPI (i.e. CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation remained sticky at heightened levels, with upside pressures across various constituent goods and services. Overall system liquidity remained in surplus, with the average daily absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) easing to ₹2.3 lakh crore during August- September (up to September 28, 2022) from ₹3.8 lakh crore in June-July. Money supply (M3) expanded y-o-y by 8.9 per cent, with aggregate deposits of commercial banks growing by 9.5 per cent and bank credit by 16.2 per cent as on September 9, 2022. India's foreign exchange reserves were placed at US$ 537.5 billion as on September 23, 2022. Outlook 8. High and protracted uncertainty surrounding the course of geopolitical conditions weighs heavily on the inflation outlook. Commodity prices, however, have softened and recession risks in advanced economies (AEs) are rising. On the domestic front, the late recovery in sowing augurs well for kharif output. The prospects for the rabi crop are buffered by comfortable reservoir levels. The risk of crop damage from excessive/unseasonal rains, however, remains. These factors have implications for the food price outlook. Elevated imported inflation pressures remain an upside risk for the future trajectory of inflation, amplified by the continuing appreciation of the US dollar. The outlook for crude oil prices is highly uncertain and tethered to geopolitical developments, with attendant concerns relating to both supply and demand. The Reserve Bank's enterprise surveys point to some easing of input cost and output price pressures across manufacturing, services and infrastructure firms; however, the pass-through of input costs to prices remains incomplete. Taking into account these factors and an average crude oil price (Indian basket) of US$ 100 per barrel, inflation is projected at 6.7 per cent in 2022-23, with Q2 at 7.1 per cent;3 Q3 at 6.5 per cent; and Q4 at 5.8 per cent, and risks are evenly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2023-24 is projected at 5.0 per cent (Chart 1). On growth, the improving outlook for agriculture and allied activities and rebound in services are boosting the prospects for aggregate supply. The Government's continued thrust on capex, improvement in capacity utilisation in manufacturing and pick-up in non-food credit should sustain the expansion in industrial activity that stalled in July. The outlook for aggregate demand is positive, with rural demand catching up and urban demand expected to strengthen further with the typical upturn in the second half of the year. According to the RBI's surveys, consumer outlook remains stable and firms in manufacturing, services and infrastructure sectors are optimistic about demand conditions and sales prospects. On the other hand, headwinds from geopolitical tensions, tightening global financial conditions and the slowing external demand pose downside risks to net exports and hence to India's GDP outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2022-23 is projected at 7.0 per cent with Q2 at 6.3 per cent; Q3 at 4.6 per cent; and Q4 at 4.6 per cent, and risks broadly balanced. For Q1:2023-24, it is projected at 7.2 per cent (Chart 2). In the MPC's view, inflation is likely to be above the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent through the first three quarters of 2022-23, with core inflation remaining high. The outlook is fraught with considerable uncertainty, given the volatile geopolitical situation, global financial market volatility and supply disruptions. Meanwhile, domestic economic activity is holding up well and is expected to be buoyant in H2:2022-23, supported by festive season demand amidst consumer and business optimism. The MPC is of the view that further calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to keep inflation expectations anchored, restrain the broadening of price pressures and pre-empt second round effects. The MPC feels that this action will support medium-term growth prospects. Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.90 per cent. Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma. Dr.Rajiv Ranjan. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points.

Israel,2022-10-03,"Inflation in Israel is above the upper bound of the target range, at 4.6 percent over the past 12 months. Inflation is being recorded in a wide range of CPI components. One-year inflation expectations are around the upper bound of the target range. Expectations from the capital market for the second year and onward are within the target range. Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel was particularly weak, dropping by 8 percent against the US dollar, by 6.2 percent against the euro, and by 5.9 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Economic activity in Israel remains strong. The labor market remains tight and is in a full employment environment. Indicators of economic activity also continue to point to increased activity and GDP that is higher than the trend that was forecast prior to the COVID-19 crisis. The Research Departmentrevised its forecast. Its assessment is that GDP will grow by 6 percent in 2022, and by 3 percent in 2023. The inflation rate is expected to be 4.6 percent in 2022, and to decline to 2.5 percent in 2023. Home prices increased by 17.9 percent in the past 12 months, significantly higher than the pace of recent years. The pace of the monthly increase in rental prices intensified, with prices increasing by 0.8 percent in August. The energy crisis in Europe and the continuing war in Ukraine, the high inflation and monetary tightening, and the slowdown in China are all leading to moderation in economic activity around the world. The Israeli economy is recording strong economic activity, accompanied by a tight labor market andan increase in the inflation environment. The Committee has therefore decided to continue the process of increasing the interest rate. The pace of raising the interest rate will be determined in accordance with activity data and the development of inflation, in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy goals. For the file figures accompanying this notice, click here Economic activity in Israel remains strong, and according to National Accounts data GDP has been above the trend line for the past three quarters. The labor market remains tight and in a full employment environment. However, the moderation of global activity is expected to lead to some slowdown in economic activity. Inflation in Israel is above the target range, and is being recorded in a wide range of CPI components. However, it is within the lowest decile among the OECD countries (Figure 30). Since the previous interest rate decision, the CPI declined by 0.3 percent in August.Inflation in the past 12 months is above the upper bound of the target range, at 4.6 percent (Figure 1). With that, inflation in Israel remains significantly lower than in most of the advanced economies (Figure 30). Net of energy and fruits and vegetables, inflation is 4.7 percent, unchanged from the previous month, and with the further neutralization of the effects of taxation and regulation, it is 4.4 percent (Figure 2). The pace of inflation of the nontradable components increased: partly in view of the increase in the housing services component: to 4.4 percent. In contrast, the annual pace of inflationof the tradable components moderated, to 5.1 percent, mainly due to the effect of declines in the price of oil and in the tax on fuel (Figure 3). ; In the Committee's assessment, the monetary tightening processes in Israel and abroad, alongside the easing of the supply chain difficulties and declines in the prices of oil and other commodities will act to moderate inflation. One-year inflation expectations are around the upper bound of the target range (Figure 5). Expectations for the second year and onward from the capital market are within the target range (Figure 6). Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel was particularly weak, falling by 8 percent against the US dollar, 6.2 percent against the euro, and by 5.9 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate (Figure 7). Economic activity is strong. The indicators of economic activity continue to point to increased activity and a GDP level that is higher than the trend line that was forecast prior to the COVID-19 crisis. The aggregate balance of the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey for August continues to reflect businesses' positive assessments of their situation (Figure 17). Due to the easing of pressure in the global supply chains, companies in the manufacturing and construction industries reported a continuing significant decline in the equipment and raw materials constraint. However, the level of the constraint remains higher than it was prior to the COVID-19 crisis. The tourism industryis also continuing its recovery, with the number of overnight hotel stays now close to its precrisis level, despite the relatively low level of incoming tourism. Goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds) remain higher than before the pandemic, and services exports remain very high (Figure 18). Goods imports are also high in all components (Figure 19). The labor market remains tight. The unemployment rate for those aged 15+ was 3.4 percent (seasonally adjusted), and the employment rate (61.5 percent) increased slightly, and is now higher than its average level in 2019. The employment rate among the prime working ages (25-64) reached a record high (Figure 22). In parallel, the demand for workers remains high. The number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate are very high, despite the continued moderate decline in August. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, there was some decline in businesses' expectations of expanding their employee numbers, but those expectations remain higher than they were prior to the crisis. Nominal wages are increasing, and are above their precrisis trend, but there is some wage erosion in real terms, with real wages now around the trend that was forecast based on the precrisis trend (Figure 25). The Bank of Israel Research Department revised its macroeconomic forecast. In itsassessment. GDP will grow by 6 percent in 2022, and by 3 percent in 2023, such that GDP at the end of 2023 is expected to be higher than what was estimated in the previous forecast (Figure 13). The level of economic activity derived from the forecast remains strong. The unemployment rate among the prime working ages (25-64) is expected to average 3.5 percent in 2023. The inflation rate is expected to be 4.6 percent in 2022 and to return to around the midpoint of the target range, falling to 2.5 percent in 2023. In addition, the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be lower than the assessment in the previous forecast, at 65 percent in 2022, and 63 percent in 2023. Home prices increased by 17.9 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 10), a significantly higher pace than in previous years. However, the numbers of building permits and of building starts increased, and are very high. In contrast, building completions have remained low thus far, in view of the extended duration of construction. The number of housing transactions continues to decline. The volume of new mortgages taken out in August declined to NIS 9.6 billion, but it remains higher than in previous years (Figure 12). The monthly pace of rent price increases climbed to 0.8 percent in August. In the domestic capital market there were declines in the equity indices, yields on long-term government bonds increased, and corporate bond spreads widened, similar to the worldwide trend (Figure 11). According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, financing constraints among businessesof various sizes remained relatively low in all sectors (Figure 17). Global economic activity continues to moderate, as a result of the combination of the energy crisis in Europe, high inflation and monetary tightening, the continuing war in Ukraine, and the slowdown in China. Supply chain difficulties also continue to weigh down on economic activity, although these have eased, including a decline in shipping costs. The OECD and investment houses revised their global growth forecasts for 2023 downward (Figure 26). The global purchasing managers' index of advanced economies declined in August, and indicates a continued slowdown in the pace of economic activity, while the index for the emerging markets declined, but continues to indicate expansion (Figure 27). The volume of activity in world trade recovered slightly in recent months, but the export orders component of the index, which is a leading indicator of the volume of tradein coming months, is at contraction level. There were sharp price declines in the main global equity markets, with high volatility (Figure 34). In parallel, there was a significant increase in government bond yields, in view of the continued interest rate increases and hawkish forward guidance of the main central banks. Likewise, corporate bond spreads widened, and indicate an increase in the risk of failure due to changes in the economic environment. Oil and other commodity prices declined in view of expectations of a continued slowdown in global economic activity (Figure 32). The global inflation environment continued to increase. In most countries, the inflation indices are significantly higher than the central bank targets (Figure 31), and monetary tightening aroundthe world therefore continues. In the US, growth forecasts for the coming months point to moderate growth. While the annual increase in the CPI declined to 8.3 percent in August, it was significantly higher than previously forecast. The Federal Reserve has significantly revised its interest rate forecast for the coming years, while lowering its growth forecast. It also increased the volume of its government bond sales. In the eurozone, despite the relatively high growth data in the second quarter, annual forecasts were revised downward in view of the effects of the energy crisis and the increasing monetary tightening. In parallel the increase in inflation continues, and the overall index is at 10.0 percent. The ECB accelerated its monetary tightening, and increased its interest rate by 75 basis points: the largest increase the ECB has ever made. In the UK, the Bank of England's monetary contraction policy continues, and the new government announced expansionary fiscal measures upon taking office, which led to a significant increase in government bond yields, and Bank of England intervention due to financial stability concerns. In a number of other countries where inflation is above the central bank target, there were increases in the interest rates (Figure 31). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on October 19, 2022. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday.

Poland,2022-10-05,"Warsaw, 5 October 2022 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 5 October 2022 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ▪ reference rate at 6.75%; ▪ lombard rate at 7.25%; ▪ deposit rate at 6.25%; ▪ rediscount rate at 6.80%; ▪ discount rate at 6.85%. Incoming data signal a deterioration of global economic conditions in 2022 Q3, accompanied, however, by continued favourable labour market situation in the largest economies. Activity in the global economy and its prospects are under the negative impact of high prices of commodities and production components, the repercussions of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine as well as the tightening of monetary policy around the world. Meanwhile, there persists uncertainty regarding further impact of these shocks on economic conditions, including the impact of the situation in energy commodity markets on activity in the European economy in the coming quarters. The weakening outlook for the global economy has been accompanied by a deterioration in sentiment and a rise of volatility across the global financial markets. Inflation in many economies is at the highest levels in decades. Significant source of high inflation continue to be high commodity prices, driven partly by the repercussions of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine, as well as persistent  despite their gradual easing  disruptions in global supply chains. In some economies, rising prices are also driven by demand factors and increasing labour costs. These factors, combined with the passing of earlier rises in production cost into the consumer goods prices, also lead to an increase in core inflation. Amidst high inflation, major central banks continued to tighten their monetary policy in the recent period. In September, the US Federal Reserve and the ECB increased interest rates once again. In Poland, available monthly data, including data on industrial production, construction and assembly output and retail sales, signal that in Q3 GDP growth, in year-on-year terms, 1/2 decelerated again. A further slowdown of GDP growth is forecast for the coming quarters, while the economic outlook is subject to significant uncertainty. Despite weakening of economic conditions, labour market situation remains very good, which is reflected in a record low unemployment rate. Inflation in Poland  according to Statistics Poland flash estimate  increased in September 2022 to 17.2% y/y. High inflation results mainly from an earlier strong rise in global energy and agricultural commodity prices  driven, to a large extent, by the repercussions of Russian military aggression against Ukraine  and earlier increases in regulated domestic tariffs on electricity, natural gas and thermal energy. Inflation is also boosted by enterprises passing rising costs on to the final goods prices and consequences of the earlier disruptions in global supply chains, simultaneously adding also to higher core inflation. In turn, a curbing impact on inflation has been exerted by a reduction in some tax rates as part of the Anti-inflationary Shield. The Council assessed, that the hitherto significant monetary policy tightening by NBP and the expected economic activity growth slowdown, which in part stems from external shocks, will contribute to curbing demand growth in the Polish economy, which will support a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target. At the same time, given strength and persistence of the current shocks that remain beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, a return of inflation towards the NBP inflation target will be gradual. The decrease in inflation would also be supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council's assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy. Further decisions of the Council will depend on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy. NBP will take all necessary actions in order to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability, including above all to reduce the risk of inflation remaining elevated. NBP may intervene in the foreign exchange market, in particular to limit fluctuations of the zloty exchange rate that are inconsistent with the direction of monetary policy."
Romania,2022-10-05,"In its meeting of 5 October 2022, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual inflation rate reached 15.32 percent in August, marginally above the forecast, after having fallen to 14.96 percent in July, from 15.05 percent in June. The increase was almost entirely driven by the continued hike in food prices, including the VFE component, however largely counterbalanced by the decline in fuel prices (amid motor fuel price compensation and lower oil prices), as well as by the base effects associated with developments in energy prices. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate continued to climb at a sustained pace in the first two months of 2022 Q3, albeit slower than in the previous quarters, going up to 10.4 percent in July, from 9.8 percent in June, and to 11.2 percent in August, slightly above the forecast, mainly owing to new rises in processed food prices. Thus, the evolution of this component continues to reflect the effects of large hikes in agri-food commodity prices and higher energy and transport costs, alongside the influences of bottlenecks in production chains. These were compounded by high short-term inflation expectations, the release of pent-up demand in certain segments, as well as by the significant share of food items and imported goods in the CPI basket. Annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP  inflation indicator for EU Member States) moved up to 13.3 percent in August, from 13.0 percent in June. Furthermore, average CPI inflation rate and average HICP inflation rate rose to 11.0 percent and 9.5 percent in August, from 9.3 percent and 7.9 percent respectively in June 2022. The inflationary effects of supply-side shocks continue to increase in Europe and other advanced countries, with the dynamics of core inflation being relevant in this respect. In the euro area, the annual CPI inflation rate reached 10 percent in September, while in Romania's neighbouring countries it ranges between 15 percent and 19 percent. Economic growth slowed down considerably in 2022 Q2 versus the previous quarter, to 2.1 percent from 5.1 percent in Q1, yet much more modestly than anticipated. This makes it likely for the excess aggregate demand to see a moderate rise in this period too, contrary to expectations. Annual GDP growth saw only a slight deceleration in 2022 Q2, to 5.3 percent, from 6.4 percent in Q1, thus remaining significantly above the forecasts. However, the largest contribution to economic growth came from the change in inventories (7.3 percentage points), while the contribution from private consumption  ranking second in terms of size  diminished considerably versus the previous quarter (to 4.7 percentage points) and that of gross fixed capital formation remained very modest, although on a slight increase. At the same time, the contribution of net exports saw a renewed strong contraction, given the slowdown in the annual dynamics of exports, concurrently with the significant re-acceleration in the annual dynamics of the imports of goods and services. The latest high-frequency indicators point to a strong deceleration in the economic growth in 2022 Q3 versus Q2, under the impact of the escalation of the war in Ukraine and the extension of the associated sanctions. However, this implies a significant step-up in the annual growth rate of GDP over this period on account of a base effect, but with decelerating private consumption increase. The slowdown in the annual dynamics of retail trade and motor vehicle and motorcycle trade, but especially of services to households in July is relevant from this perspective. At the same time, industrial output and the volume of new orders in manufacturing posted larger annual contractions, but the volume of construction works witnessed a significant step-up in annual terms. Furthermore, the annual change of exports of goods and services declined marginally in July, while that of imports picked up slightly, inter alia against the backdrop of unfavourable developments in external prices. This led to a renewed advance in the fast annual growth rate of trade deficit compared to the Q2 average, and especially in the annual dynamics of the current account deficit, which also reflected a deterioration in the secondary income balance during this month. The rise in the number of employees economy-wide lost pace in June-July, on the back of private sector developments, while the drop in the ILO unemployment rate to 5.1 percent in August was accompanied during 2022 Q2 by a slight contraction in labour demand. Moreover, the latest surveys indicate a slight decrease in the labour shortage reported by companies, after its continuous increase over the last six quarters, as well as a relative weakening of hiring intentions in the near run, in the context of the extremely high energy costs and the uncertainties generated by the war in Ukraine and the related increasingly strict sanctions. Looking at the financial market, the main interbank money market rates have recently stabilised marginally above the values reached towards end-July, after slight downward adjustments recorded in August, on the backdrop of the latest monetary policy decision and the central bank's forward guidance. In turn, yields on government securities partly recovered the decreases seen in July-August and followed a moderately upward path in September, similarly to developments in advanced economies and in the region, amid the firm monetary policy tightening by major central banks, associated with a worsening of global financial market sentiment. However, the average interest rate on new loans, but also that on new time deposits posted a markedly faster growth July through August, including in the household segment. Against this background, the leu fully corrected in September the significant appreciation versus the euro recorded July through August, which had been strongly driven by domestic seasonal developments as well. Against the US dollar, the leu depreciated following the movements on international financial markets. The double-digit annual dynamics of credit to the private sector embarked on a downward path at the beginning of H2, gradually shrinking to 15.9 percent in August (from 17.5 percent in June), amid the steeper drop in the high dynamics of the domestic currency component. As a result, the share of leu-denominated loans in credit to the private sector fell slightly to 71.8 percent in August (against 72.0 percent in June). According to current assessments, the annual inflation rate will probably stick to an upward path towards year-end, under the impact of supply-side shocks, yet at a visibly slower pace. Behind the additional worsening of the near-term inflation outlook stand the faster growth rates anticipated over the following months for the prices of natural gas and electricity  inter alia amid the changes made to the electricity price capping scheme , as well as for food prices. The latter is seen to be influenced by the hefty advance in agri-food commodity prices, owing to the war in Ukraine and the associated sanctions, but also to the protracted and widespread drought in Europe this summer. The impact of these factors will only partly be counterbalanced by the disinflationary base effects anticipated to occur in the near run inter alia for fuels. The escalation of the war in Ukraine and the related increasingly harsh sanctions generate, however, considerable uncertainties and risks to the outlook for economic activity, hence to medium-term inflation developments, through the possibly stronger effects exerted, via multiple channels, on consumer purchasing power and confidence, as well as on firms' activity, profits and investment plans, but also by potentially affecting more severely the European/global economy and the risk perception towards economies in the region, with an unfavourable impact on financing costs. Furthermore, the absorption of EU funds, especially those under the Next Generation EU programme, is conditional on fulfilling strict milestones and targets for implementing the approved projects. However, it is essential for carrying out the necessary structural reforms, energy transition included, but also for counterbalancing, at least in part, the contractionary impact of supply-side shocks, compounded by the war in Ukraine. Major uncertainties and risks are also associated with the fiscal policy stance, given the requirement for further budget consolidation amid the excessive deficit procedure and the overall tightening trend of financing conditions, yet in a challenging economic and social environment domestically and globally, which led to the implementation of several packages of measures to support households and firms, with potential adverse implications for budget parameters. Also relevant are the ECB's and the Fed's prospective monetary policy stances, as well as the behaviour of central banks in the region. In the meeting held today, 5 October 2022, based on the currently available data and assessments, as well as in light of the very elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 6.25 percent per annum from 5.50 percent per annum as of 6 October 2022. Moreover, it decided to raise the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 7.25 percent per annum from 6.50 percent per annum and the deposit facility rate to 5.25 percent per annum from 4.50 percent per annum, as well as to maintain firm control over money market liquidity. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to keep the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to anchor inflation expectations over the medium term, as well as to foster saving through higher bank rates, so as to bring back the annual inflation rate in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat target on a lasting basis, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. At the current juncture, a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms inter alia by using EU funds to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand adverse developments. The NBR closely monitors developments in the domestic and international environment and will continue to use the tools at its disposal to achieve the fundamental objective of price stability in the medium term. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 19 October 2022 at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board will be held on 8 November 2022."
Peru,2022-10-06,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT OCTOBER 2022 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 7.00% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 25 bps to 7.00 percent, thus continuing to adjust its monetary policy stance. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation increased from 8.40 percent in August to 8.53 percent in September, above the target range, due to significant increases in international food and fuel prices. Core inflation increased from 5,39 percent in August to 5.51 percent in September, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The significant increase in international food and fuel prices since the second half of last year, accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in global inflation in magnitudes not seen in many years and towards levels significantly higher than the inflation targets of central banks, both in advanced and other economies in the region. A downward trend in year-on-year inflation is forecast with a return to the target range in the second half of next year, due to a moderation of the impact of international food and fuel prices, and to a reduction in inflation expectations. One-year-ahead expected inflation decreased from 5.10 to 4.89 percent between August and September, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Several leading indicators and expectations for economic activity recovered in September, but most remain pessimistic. The outlook for global economic activity this year and the next has deteriorated due to expected policy interest rate hikes in advanced economies, lower growth in China, and international conflicts. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants, including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, to consider changes in the monetary stance. The Board reaffirms its commitment to adopt necessary actions to ensure the return of inflation to the target range over the forecast horizon. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 5.00 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 7.50 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months and the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months. In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates based on the amount of the operations. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on November 10, 2022."
Pakistan,2022-10-10,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement October 10, 2022. At today's meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the policy rate at 15 percent. The MPC noted the continued deceleration in economic activity as well as the decline in headline inflation and the current account deficit since the last meeting. It also noted that the recent floods have altered the macroeconomic outlook and fuller assessment of their impact is underway. Based on currently available information, the MPC was of the view that the existing monetary policy stance strikes an appropriate balance between managing inflation and maintaining growth in the wake of the floods. On the one hand, inflation could be higher and more persistent due to the supply shock to food prices, and it is important to ensure that this additional impetus does not spillover into broader prices in the economy. On the other, growth prospects have weakened, which should reduce demand-side pressures and suppress underlying inflation. In light of these offsetting considerations, the MPC considered it prudent to leave monetary policy settings unchanged at this stage. Since the last meeting, the MPC noted several key developments. First the desired moderation in economic activity has become more visible and entrenched, signaling that the tightening measures implemented over the last year are gaining traction. With growth likely to slow further in the aftermath of the floods, this tightening will need to be carefully calibrated going forward. Second after peaking in August as expected, headline inflation fell last month due to an administrative cut in electricity prices. However core inflation continued to drift upwards in both rural and urban areas. Third the current account and trade deficits narrowed significantly in August and September, respectively, and the Rupee has recouped some of its losses following the recent depreciation. Fourth the combined 7th and 8th review under the on-going IMF program was successfully completed on August 29th, releasing tranche of $1. billion. The MPC discussed the post-flood macroeconomic outlook, noting that projections are still preliminary and would become firmer after the flood damage assessment being conducted by the government is finalized. Based on currently available information. GDP growth could fall to around percent in FY23, compared to the previous forecast of 3-4 percent before the floods. Meanwhile higher food prices could raise average headline inflation in FY23 somewhat above the pre-flood projection of 18-20 percent. The impact on the current account deficit is likely to be muted, with pressures from higher food and cotton imports and lower textile exports largely offset by slower domestic demand and lower global commodity prices. As result, any deterioration in the current account deficit is expected to be contained, still leaving it in the vicinity of the previously forecast percent of GDP. Real sector. The economy has slowed considerably since the last MPC meeting. Most demand indicators were lower in both July and August than in the same period last year—including sales of cement. POL, and automobiles. On the supply side, electricity generation declined for the third consecutive month in August, falling by 12. percent (y/y). In July. LSM declined by. percent (y/y), its first contraction in two years, largely driven by broad-based deterioration in domestically-oriented sectors. Looking ahead, the recent floods are likely to adversely affect the output of cotton and rice as well as the livestock sector this year. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN External sector. The current account deficit shrank for the second consecutive month in August to only $0. billion, almost half the level in July. In September. PBS data shows that the trade deficit contracted sharply by 19. percent (m/m) and 30. percent (y/y) to reach $2. billion, reflecting decline in both energy and non-energy imports amid stable exports. During the first quarter of FY23, imports have declined by 12. percent (y/y) to $16. billion while exports have grown by. percent (y/y) to $7 billion. Looking ahead, the floods are likely to result in greater need for some agricultural imports such as cotton and few perishable food items. At the same time, exports of rice and textiles are likely to be negatively affected. However these adverse impacts could to large extent be offset by downward pressures on the import bill from lower domestic growth and falling global commodity prices and shipping costs. In addition, as experienced after previous natural disasters in Pakistan, the impact on the current account could be further cushioned by international assistance in the form of current transfers. Given secured external financing and additional commitments in the wake of the floods. FX reserves should improve through the course of the year. Fiscal sector. In July, fiscal outcomes were better than in the same period last year. The fiscal deficit fell to. percent of GDP while the primary balance recorded surplus of. percent of GDP. This improvement was largely due to higher FBR tax revenues as well as decline in government spending. During the first quarter. FBR tax collection rose to Rs.635 trillion, surpassing the target by Rs 27 billion. While the floods could make it challenging to achieve the planned fiscal consolidation this year, the government has so far been able to meet urgent spending needs through re-allocation and re-appropriations of budgeted funds. Looking ahead, additional foreign inflows, including in the form of grants, should help fund any fiscal slippages. Beyond the current year, reconstruction and rehabilitation will necessitate additional spending over the medium-term, with assistance from the international community. Monetary and inflation outlook. In line with slowing economic activity, private sector credit has seen net retirement of Rs. billion so far this fiscal year, compared to an expansion of Rs 62. billion during the same period last year. This decline in credit mainly reflects retirement of working capital loans and sharp fall in consumer finance. After peaking in August, headline inflation fell by more than percentage points in September to 23. percent (y/y), driven by reduction in electricity prices due to an administrative intervention. At the same time, the momentum of inflation also slowed by more than expected, declining by. percent (m/m). On the other hand, both core and food inflation picked up further. Looking ahead, the supply-shock to food prices from the floods is expected to put additional pressure on headline inflation in the coming months. Nevertheless headline inflation is still projected to gradually decline through the rest of the fiscal year, particularly in the second half. Thereafter it should fall towards the upper range of the 5-7 percent medium- term target by the end of FY24. continuation of prudent monetary policy and orderly movements in the Rupee should help contain core inflation going forward. At the same time, curbing food inflation through administrative measures to resolve supply-chain bottlenecks and any necessary imports should be high priority. The MPC will continue to carefully monitor developments affecting medium-term prospects for inflation, financial stability, and growth. Page."
Chile,2022-10-12,"NoPtrae sds eR epleraesne s*a Wednesday, 12 October 2022 Monetary Policy Meeting  October 2022 At its monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 11.25%. The decision was adopted with the unanimous vote of its members. The outlook for global growth and international financial conditions has deteriorated. World inflation has continued to show signs of increased persistence, central banks have continued to raise their benchmark rates and market expectations point to a protracted monetary tightening in developed economies. Global financial markets maintain high levels of volatility. The dollar has further strengthened around the world, stock prices have fallen and long-term interest rates have risen. Commodity prices have fluctuated. In the days preceding this Meeting, the barrel of oil was trading at around US$90 while copper was close to US$3.5, per pound. The domestic financial market has mirrored the recent global trends. Compared to the previous meeting, the exchange rate depreciated by around 5%, long-term interest rates rose -especially the UF-indexed and the IPSA stock index posted losses. Bank credit continues to decelerate, amid still tight supply conditions and demand that is perceived to have weakened for all segments. Last August, the non-mining component of the Imacec (+1.3% annualized; +0.7% monthly seasonally adjusted) was somewhat higher than expected in the September Monetary Policy Report, mainly due to increased activity in some services. However, sectors like trade, manufacturing and construction fell significantly, in line with expectations. On the expenditure side, indicators related to private consumption show further declines. Those linked to investment have remained weak, although with some resilience in some sectors that have boosted imports of machinery and equipment. In the labor market, job creation is stagnant and vacancies continue to decline. The unemployment and participation rates show no big changes. The annual change in real wages continues to be negative. The consumer and business confidence indices remain in the pessimistic zone, although with some recovery most recently. In September, headline inflation was 13.7% annually, a slight decline from August. Core inflation, meanwhile, rose to 11.1% annually. Compared with the MP Report, cumulative inflation in the last two months has been higher than estimated, mainly due to sharper increases in the prices of some foods. Two-year inflation expectations continue to be above 3%. The Board estimates that the monetary policy rate has reached its maximum level of the cycle that began in July 2021, and that it will remain there for as long as necessary to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target over the two-year policy horizon. The macroeconomic scenario presents high risks whose short- and medium-term implications must be evaluated carefully. The Board will monitor closely the unfolding of these events, and hereby reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, in order for projected inflation to stand at 3% annually in the policy horizon. Nota de prensa The minutes of this monetary policy meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Thursday, 27 October 2022. The next monetary policy meeting will take place on Tuesday, 6 December 2022 and the statement thereof will be released at 18:00 hours the same day. The Spanish original prevails.

South Korea,2022-10-12,"The bank of korea. Monetary Policy Decision. (Statement). The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 50 basis points, from 2.50% to 3.00%. The Board judges that the policy response should be strengthened, as additional inflationary pressures and the risks to the foreign exchange sector have increased affected by the rising Korean won to US dollar exchange rate, while inflation has remained high. Currently available information suggests that the global economic slowdown has continued, affected by the ongoing high inflation, further tightening of the US Federal Reserve's policy stance and the prolonged Ukraine crisis. In global financial markets, long-term market interest rates have risen significantly and stock prices have fallen, and financial unrest has emerged in some countries, while major currencies have depreciated due to the reinforced trend of US dollar strength. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the movements of international commodity prices and global inflation, monetary policy changes in major countries and US dollar trends, and geopolitical risks. Domestic economic growth has slowed due to lower export growth, while private consumption has maintained its recovery trend. Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed remaining high. Going forward, domestic economic growth is expected to slow gradually, affected by the global economic slowdown and the increase in interest rates. GDP growth for this year will be generally consistent with the August forecast of 2.6%, but that for next year is projected to be below the August forecast of 2.1%. Consumer price inflation has remained high in the mid- to upper-5% range due to the accelerating price increases in personal services and processed food products, although increases in the prices of petroleum products have moderated. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) and the inflation expectations of the general public have stayed high in the 4% range. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain high in the 5-6% range for a considerable time as the impact of the rising Korean won to US dollar exchange rate acts as additional inflationary pressure. Consumer price inflation will be generally consistent with the August forecast of 5.2% in 2022 and 3.7% in 2023, but upside risks are judged to be high due to the rising Korean won to US dollar exchange rate and production cuts by major oil-producing countries, despite downward pressures from the economic slowdown. Volatility in domestic financial markets has increased, especially in the foreign exchange sector, as the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has risen significantly and foreigners' securities investment funds have shown net outflows, influenced by the strong US dollar and the weak yen and yuan. Long-term market interest rates have risen considerably and stock prices have fallen sharply. Household loans have decreased slightly and housing prices have further decreased. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon as it monitors economic growth, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board sees continued rate hikes as warranted, as inflation is expected to remain high, substantially above the target level, although domestic economic activity has slowed. In this process the Board will determine the size and pace of further increases of the Base Rate while thoroughly assessing the degree of persistence of high inflation, the pace of growth, monetary policy changes in major countries, financial stability conditions such as capital flows, and geopolitical risks. Opening Remarks to the Press Conference. The Monetary Policy Board (MPB) of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 50 basis points from 2.50% to 3.00%. I will now explain the detailed background to today's Base Rate decision, after briefly going over global and domestic financial and economic conditions. First, looking at the changes in external conditions since the August MPB meeting, projections for the US Federal Reserve's policy rate destination have increased quite considerably from around 4% to the upper-4% level, adding to concerns about the global economic slowdown and intensifying global financial market volatility. Major advanced economies have been seeing slowing growth driven by high inflation of 8 to 10% and the resultant further tightening by their central banks. The Chinese economy also remains sluggish due to slumps in its property market and exports. In the global financial markets, long-term market interest rates have risen sharply and stock prices have plunged. Major currencies have depreciated as the US dollar strengthened further, resulting in financial strains in some countries. Turning to domestic conditions, our growth has been slowing. Although consumption has maintained its recovery momentum, export growth has been on a gradual downturn, affected by the global economic slowdown. We expect this slowing trend to continue going forward. GDP growth for this year is likely to be generally in line with the August projection (2.6%), but for next year it is forecast to stand below that level (2.1%). Consumer price inflation continues to be high at the mid- to upper-5% level. The rise in oil prices has slowed, but prices of personal services and processed food have climbed faster. Core inflation and the inflation expectations of the general public remain elevated at the 4% level. Consumer price inflation is expected to run high in the 5-6% range for a considerable time, as the Korean won depreciation adds further upward pressures to prices. Although the consumer price inflation for this year and next will be generally in line with the August projections (5.2% and 3.7%, respectively), we see the upside risk from the weak Korean won and production cuts by major oil-producing countries as outweighing downside pressures from the slowing economy. In the domestic financial markets, volatility has greatly increased, led by the foreign exchange sector. The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has risen to well above 1,400 won, and securities investment funds of foreigners switched to a net outflow during September, reflecting strengthening of the US dollar and depreciation of the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan, combined with the continued trade deficit. Long-term market interest rates have moved up significantly, affected by an increase in government bond yields in major countries, and stock prices have fallen. Looking at household debt and the housing market, household loans decreased slightly, as the sustained net redemption of unsecured loans more than offset a rise in housing-related lending. Housing prices have further decreased. The Board decided today to raise the Base Rate by 50 basis points in consideration of the need to strengthen its policy response. Although GDP growth for next year is projected to be below the August forecast, we judged that upside risk to consumer price inflation, which is expected to persist in the high range of 5-6% for a considerable time, has increased as a result of the depreciation of the Korean won. In addition, market expectations for Korean won depreciation have acted in part as a financial instability factor by increasing capital outflow pressure and causing herd behavior in the foreign exchange market. Two members―Joo. Sangyong and Shin. Sung Hwan―voted against the decision to raise the Base Rate by 50 basis points, proposing to raise it by 25 basis points. Looking ahead, the Board deems it warranted to maintain its stance of Base Rate hikes going forward, as inflation is projected to run above the target level for a considerable time. This stance is expected to help stabilize the foreign exchange market by alleviating concerns over the negative policy rate gap between the Bank of Korea and the US Federal Reserve. Regarding the size of the policy rate hike in November, there are different views among the Board members and the uncertainties surrounding the policy decision are very high. The Board will determine the size of the next rate hike and the path of further increases after closely monitoring external conditions, such as results of the November FOMC meeting and movements in international commodity prices, and evaluating how these conditions may affect domestic inflation and growth as well as financial and foreign exchange markets. I would like to make one last remark. The Board is well aware that the public is suffering a heavier burden as the Base Rate is hiked. However, increasing the Base Rate for price stability in the current high-inflation environment will be necessary for some time to prevent the economy as a whole from suffering from a greater loss. The Bank of Korea will do its best to stabilize the economy as quickly as possible."
Turkiye,2022-10-20,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 12 percent to 10.5 percent. The weakening effects of geopolitical risks on global economic activity continue to increase. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards and recession is increasingly assessed as an inevitable risk factor. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the upward trend in producer and consumer prices continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to rising energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and rigidities in labor markets. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue to increase due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. A strong growth was observed in the first half of 2022. Leading indicators for the second half of the year continue pointing to a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand. Pressures on the manufacturing industry due to foreign demand and their currently limited impact on domestic demand and supply capacity are being monitored closely. Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues. On the other hand, high course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. In addition, the spread between policy rate and the loan interest rates driven by the announced macroprudential measures is closely monitored. The Committee will continue to further strengthen the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism. Increase in inflation is driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. The effects of slowing foreign demand on aggregate demand conditions and production are closely monitored. It is critically important that financial conditions remain supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as further escalation of geopolitical risks. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to reduce the policy rate by 150 basis points. The Committee evaluated taking a similar step in the following meeting and ending the rate cut cycle. To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2022-10-20,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 25% per annum. With exchange rate stability supported by the key policy rate and the NBU's additional measures, inflation processes will remain under control. As expected, inflation has been rising during the war but remains controllable. Consumer inflation in Ukraine was 24.6% yoy in September, and core inflation exceeded 20% yoy. Inflation continued to accelerate in October, according to the NBU's preliminary estimates. Consequences of russia's full-scale war against Ukraine remain the main price driver. This includes supply chain disruptions, destruction of production facilities, reduced supply of goods and services, and higher costs incurred by businesses. Another inflation driver has been the pass-through effect that the adjustment of the official hryvnia-to-dollar exchange rate had on prices. A further rise in global inflation also influenced prices in Ukraine. At the same time, the actual price dynamics were in line with the expectations and even somewhat below the NBU's July forecast. Fixing utility rates and the saturation of the domestic fuel market while keeping the preferential tax regime for fuel curbed price growth. The planned reduction in monetary financing of the budget and the NBU's additional measures to calibrate FX restrictions helped ease pressures on the FX market, restraining the deterioration in expectations. Inflation will reach around 30% this year, but it should slow in the next years provided that security risks subside as expected and monetary and fiscal policies are well coordinated. Due to the adverse impact of the full-scale war on supply of goods and economic agents' expectations, inflation will accelerate to 30% at the end of this year. However, such price growth is rather moderate considering the challenges of the largest war in Europe since World War II and inflation reaching its highest levels over many years in many countries. Price pressures and expectations will remain under control, laying the groundwork for a gradual slowdown in inflation. The NBU expects that price growth will slow next year thanks to a gradual setup of logistics and production, lower global inflation, and moderately tight monetary conditions. This process will accelerate in the middle of the year in view of the high base effect and expected easing of security risks, which is a key assumption of the new forecast of the NBU. The latter factor will lead to a sizeable decline in inflation expectations and risks to business activities, a decrease in production costs, setup of logistics, including through Black Sea ports, and a recovery in production capacity. All of this will result in further growth in supply and a stabilization of consumer prices. Prudent debt policy of the government and refusal from monetary financing of the budget deficit will be an additional factor for an improvement in inflation expectations. The relevant factors will drive inflation down to 20.8% next year and to below 10% in 2024. A faster decrease in inflation in the next years will be restrained mainly by high energy prices, which will require to gradually bring utility tariffs to market levels. After a deep fall at the start of the war, the economy of Ukraine has been picking up. The gradual recovery will continue in 20232024. Economic activity recovered gradually in Q2Q3 2022 on the back of further liberation of Ukrainian territories, businesses adapting to new conditions, and opening the “grain corridor”. The latter factor made a positive contribution to GDP compared to the July forecast. However, the existing logistical problems (especially in the metals industry), destruction of production facilities (in the energy sector in particular), and a decline in real household income are restraining economic recovery. A large negative contribution to real GDP change expectedly came from agriculture  due to both this year's lower yields and considerably smaller sown areas. As a result, the NBU upgraded its estimate of a decrease in GDP for this year only slightly, to around 32%. A decline in security risks from the middle of 2023 assumed by the forecast will be the key factor in the future economic recovery. In particular, the full recovery in operations of Black Sea ports will enable a significant increase in Ukrainian exports. Large budget support will boost consumer demand and investment in the reconstruction of the country. At the same time, huge losses of labor force and production capacity, high global energy prices, and large import needs in the period of post-war reconstruction will be a drag on economic recovery. Under such conditions, growth in Ukraine's GDP will be moderate in the next years, at around 4%5%. Exports being limited due to the war, strong migration, and the economy's large needs for imports to carry out the reconstruction will cause the current account to return to deficit in the coming years. International financial support and revived exports contributed to an increase in FX inflows to Ukraine. Official financing has reached around USD 23 billion since the start of the full-scale invasion. The lion's share of the financing came as grants in several past months. In autumn, exports of goods peaked from the start of the war thanks to the launch of the “grain corridor” and record-high growth in electricity supply to the EU. A correction of the official exchange rate of the hryvnia and the cancellation of the preferential tax regime slowed the recovery in imports of goods. This resulted in a large surplus in the current account. The current account will return to deficit next year. On the one hand, international financial assistance in 20232024 is expected to be large, in particular in the form of grants. The improvement in security assumed in the forecast will favor further growth in exports, and remittances from labor migrants will not be lower than before the war. On the other hand, the country will need large volumes of imports. Moreover, as security risks remain high, migration will continue to be strong, reflecting in large volumes of imports of travel services. Continued cooperation with international partners remains an important factor in maintaining the Ukrainian economy during the full-scale war and post-war recovery. International financial aid has become the main source of meeting significant budgetary needs during the full-scale war. The budget deficit will decrease in the coming years, but will still be substantial due to the need to maintain the country's defense capabilities, and to ensure the smooth functioning of the economy. That is why Ukraine's cooperation with its international partners remains a critically important source for replenishing the budget. International support will also enable the NBU to maintain its international reserves at a sufficient level, keep expectations under control, and to safeguard financial stability. The key assumption of the forecast is that security risks will start to decline significantly from mid-2023. Therefore, a more extended full-scale war against Ukraine by russia remains the key risk for Ukraine's economic development. The NBU has revised its key assumption of the security situation forecast. The baseline scenario of the new macro forecast envisages a noticeable reduction in security risks only from the middle of 2023. Therefore, the full unblocking of sea ports, reductions in Ukraine's risk premiums, and an increase of investment in the restoration of the country have been delayed. If the full-scale war lasts longer than is envisaged in the baseline scenario of the current forecast, depressed demand, low investment and logistical constraints on exports will persist longer. Under such conditions, the recovery of the Ukrainian economy will be weaker, and inflation will be higher than currently expected. Other risks are also relevant for the forecast. When realized, most of these risks will worsen inflation dynamics and hold back economic recovery. despite a certain easing, the risk of state finances becoming unbalanced persists on the back of the unpredictable nature of the war, possible problems with the regularity of international aid provision, and the emergence of additional budgetary needs. Another problem could arise from the formation of large quasi-fiscal deficits in the energy sector, taking into account high energy prices.russia's terrorist attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure facilities are increasing the risk to Ukraine's ability to go through the coming winter smoothly. The lack of capacities would create the need to save energy, through temporarily disconnecting power supply for both household consumers and companies. This would decrease production.the duration and intensity of hostilities, together with energy terror attacks, are increasing the risk that a large part of Ukrainians who had gone abroad, will not return, and that some more Ukrainian may decide to leave Ukraine. A potential demographic crisis would slow the post-war recovery due to a decline in consumer demand and aggravated structural problems on the labor market.There is still a risk that the “grain corridor” may be terminated and that russia may block Ukraine's seaports. Should it materialize, it would greatly complicate food exports, reduce FX inflows to Ukraine, diminish the farmers' financial capability to carry out the sowing campaign, and have an adverse impact on the country's economy, both at the end of this year and throughout next year.Instead, the rapid implementation of a recovery plan for Ukraine, generating foreign investment inflows and substantial funding for reconstruction projects could accelerate economic growth to two-digit figures and facilitate faster return of inflation to its target of 5% set by the NBU. As the inflation dynamics are close to the forecast and the balance of risks is skewed upward over the policy horizon, the NBU Board decided to keep the key policy rate at 25%. Supporting the exchange rate stability and protecting international reserves require ensuring that yields on hryvnia assets stay attractive in the long run. Among other things, keeping the key policy rate unchanged will be a favorable factor for this. Interest rates on hryvnia deposits continue to rise closely following the expected trajectory in response to the key policy rate hike in June. The NBU also welcomes the decision of the Ministry of Finance to raise interest rates on hryvnia domestic government debt securities at the latest auction. First, such step enables a sizeable increase in volumes of borrowing compared to previous auctions, which reduces the need of monetary financing of the budget. Second, it gave an additional impetus to other interest rates on the financial market, which is important for ensuring attractive yields on hryvnia assets. In order to stabilize exchange rate expectations and reduce pressures on international reserves, the NBU developed a new mechanism that will provide households with more options to protect their savings from the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and will help dampen demand for FX cash. Such an instrument will create economic incentives for banks to introduce a corresponding product for private clients, enhance the effect of monetary transmission, and improve resilience of the fixed official exchange rate regime. Moreover, the NBU has developed a set of potential measures for reinforcing monetary transmission and optimizing the structural surplus of hryvnia liquidity. The detailed design of these measures is being discussed as part of current consultations of the NBU and the Ministry of Finance with the International Monetary Fund. The updated forecast, like the previous one, envisages that the key policy rate will be maintained at 25% at least until Q2 2024. If required, the NBU stands ready to raise the key policy rate above its forecast and will further deploy additional measures to protect international reserves, as well as and to maintain control over inflation. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 25% per annum was approved by NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No. 505, dated 20 October 2022. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the central bank's Inflation Report on 27 October 2022. A summary of the discussion between Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of the NBU Board's decision will be published on 31 October 2022. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 8 December 2022, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
Hungary,2022-10-25,"At its meeting on 25 October 2022, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 26 October 2022:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. The risk of recession in the global economy has increased further due to the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war, the European energy crisis and the generally rising interest rate environment. The effects of the exceptional drought in Europe are expected to push inflation rates up further over the short term; however, signs of an impending turnaround in commodity markets have clearly appeared. Growing recession risks, alongside falling global energy and commodity prices and international freight costs, point to a moderation in global inflation from 2023. International investor sentiment remains unfavourable. Expectations for interest rate hikes by the world's leading central banks, fears of recession, the European energy crisis and concerns about the Russian-Ukrainian war have generally led to an increase in risk aversion. Global prices of most commodities have fallen in recent months but remained at high levels. Gas futures prices in European markets have declined significantly following summer peaks. As for the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, market pricing and decision makers' communications also suggest further interest rate increases. In the CEE region, the Czech and the Polish central banks did not continue to raise their policy rates. The Romanian central bank raised its policy rate by 75 basis points, exceeding expectations. High-frequency data show that the Hungarian economic growth has been clearly slowing since early June. Industrial production increased in August, with construction output remaining unchanged on a year-on-year basis. A slowdown has been seen in the annual growth rate of retail sales since the spring. The labour market continues to be tight, and the unemployment rate is low. The economic slowdown and the effects of high energy prices are increasingly reflected in a general deterioration in sentiment indicators. The components of domestic demand are expected to be the main contributors to growth throughout this year. In 2023, growing precaution and a higher level of energy prices than before will cause household consumption to decrease. Rising costs and more uncertain demand prospects induce companies to postpone investments, while the rescheduling of public development projects will also restrain investment activity. Net exports are expected to make a positive contribution to GDP growth again from the end of 2023 as external markets and supply chains recover. In September 2022, annual inflation was 20.1 percent and core inflation stood at 20.7 percent. Nearly 85 percent of the 4.5 percentage point increase in inflation was due to rises in the prices of regulated products and services and of food. The monthly change in demand-sensitive inflation, which better reflects developments in the demand environment, has slowed down. Inflation expectations remain elevated, while expectations of increases in retail prices have fallen as demand weakened. In the autumn months, inflation in Hungary has mainly been fuelled by items outside the scope of monetary policy. As a result of the exceptional drought and the pass-through of high energy prices, inflation will rise further at a declining pace in the coming months. The easing of external inflationary pressures, the slowdown in global economic growth and the downward pressure on prices, resulting from shrinking domestic demand, are expected to become more pronounced in domestic inflation from early 2023, leading to a gradual turnaround in price growth. Tight monetary conditions contribute to avoiding second-round inflationary effects and anchoring inflation expectations. There are symmetric risks to the outlook for inflation. The consumer price index may average between 13.514.5 percent in 2022. Domestic inflation will decrease slowly in the first half of 2023, and then more significantly from the middle of the year. The consumer price index will return to the central bank tolerance band in the first half of 2024. The measures announced by the Government and their implementation are expected to ensure the achievement of this year's budget deficit target indicated by the Ministry of Finance. Thus, the government debt-to-GDP ratio will decrease to close to 76 percent of GDP by the end of 2022. The current account deficit is expected to continue rising temporarily in 2022 due to the import-increasing effect of high energy prices. Nevertheless, the increasing surplus in items of the current account excluding the energy balance, falling energy prices and growing adjustment in the energy market might lead to a rapid improvement. By 2024, with the normalisation of the global economic environment and the pick-up of the production of significant new export capacities built in recent years, the external balance position is expected to improve significantly. In line with its previous communication, the Monetary Council kept the base rate at 13.00 percent at its meeting today. In addition, the O/N deposit rate and the O/N collateralised borrowing rate were left unchanged at 12.50 percent and 25.00 percent, respectively. The current 13 percent level of the base rate, resulting from the Bank's cycle of base rate hikes, is adequate to manage fundamental inflation risks. With the real interest rate turning positive, slowing domestic demand in 2023 is expected to reduce inflation. By raising the required reserve ratio, holding central bank discount bond auctions and launching a longer-term deposit instrument from 1 October, the MNB has significantly reduced interbank forint liquidity in order to further increase the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. Over half of this liquidity is now tied up in permanently sterilised assets. In the current turbulent environment in financial markets, ensuring market stability is key to achieving the primary objective of price stability. The targeted and temporary measures taken by the Bank in mid-October support the management of market risks and promote a balance between supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. By raising the upper bound of the interest rate corridor by 950 basis points, the tighter interest rate conditions on overnight quick deposit tenders and foreign exchange swaps are raising short-term rates and properly influencing interest-sensitive capital flows. The impact of non-interest-sensitive market developments is offset by the Bank's commitment to directly meeting major foreign currency liquidity needs arising from covering net energy imports in the coming months. The MNB continues to take into account considerations regarding the adequacy of foreign currency reserves. In recent months, domestic economic agents have begun to adjust in the energy market through a decline in energy consumption. This, along with a fall in energy prices, allows to maintain balance in the foreign exchange market by providing less foreign currency liquidity than earlier expected. In the Monetary Council's assessment, maintaining the current level of the base rate for a prolonged period is consistent with the achievement of the price stability objective over the monetary policy horizon. The instruments applied over the past month, designed to drain interbank liquidity, are effective in strengthening monetary policy transmission. Additionally, maintaining market stability in a rapidly changing risk environment is also crucial to achieve price stability. The MNB continuously assesses economic and financial market developments and will continue to use the instruments introduced in mid-October as long as it is warranted by the maintenance of market stability and developments in risk perceptions. Tight monetary conditions will be maintained over a prolonged period, which will ensure that inflation expectations are anchored and the inflation target is achieved in a sustainable manner."
Brazil,2022-10-26,"In its 250th meeting, the Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's scenario:. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; the uncertainty about the country's future fiscal framework and additional fiscal stimuli that support aggregate demand, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset prices; and an output gap tighter than the one currently adopted by the Committee in its reference scenario, especially in the labor market. Among the downside risks, it should be noted an additional reduction in the prices of international commodities measured in local currency; a greater than projected deceleration of global economic activity; and the continuity of tax cuts assumed to be reversed in 2023. The Committee assesses that the still uncertain and volatile current scenario requires serenity when evaluating risks. Considering the assessed scenarios, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and 2024. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing economic fluctuations and fostering full employment. The Committee will remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets. The Committee reinforces that future monetary policy steps can be adjusted and will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto de Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Diogo Abry Guillen. Fernanda Magalhaes Rumenos Guardado. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza and Renato Dias de Brito Gomes. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Kazakhstan,2022-10-26,"The base rate was raised to 16% October 26, 2022 Astana The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to raise the base rate at 16% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1.0 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities set on 17% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 15%. The decision adjusts the trajectory of the rate, maintaining the direction and pace set by previous decisions and communications. The rate hike is due to a combination of factors pointing to rising inflationary pressures. The surpass of inflation over forecasts in September became quite significant. The key factors behind the decision were high inflation expectations, steady demand, fiscal impulse, rising production costs due to a shift to a more sustainable supply chain, the continued pass- through of external inflation, including the continued strength of the Russian ruble. Increased inflationary expectations are putting pressure on prices and consumer behavior. All of this requires tighter monetary conditions to keep inflation under control in 2023. The effect of an increase in the base rate will be seen with a lag of 1-2 years, supporting the savings activity of economic entities and contributing to the balance on the domestic foreign exchange market. In September 2022, annual inflation was 17.7%, significantly deviating from the projected trajectory. A steady rise in prices across all components of inflation has been observed. After a slowdown in July, the seasonally adjusted consumer price growth accelerated significantly in recent months. The annulated rate in September was 26.8% (17.7% in July 2022). Core inflation is forming at elevated levels, reaching 19.7% in annual terms. This indicates the risk of formation of a prolonged high inflationary background in the economy. Inflationary expectations of the population and professional macroeconomists have increased significantly. The median estimate of expected inflation by the public for the year ahead rose to 16.9% in September 2022. Estimates of future price growth on the part of the population are mainly due to expected changes in food prices, external events and changes in the exchange rate. The growth of inflationary expectations occurs amid migration shock, which is of short-term nature. Nevertheless, this created risks of secondary effects due to the direct impact on inflationary expectations. The September 2022 survey also shows a significant increase in inflation expected by professional macroeconomists to 18.5% in 2022 and 11% in 2023 (up from 15.1% and 8.8%, respectively, in the previous August 2022 survey). Stronger fiscal stimulus is a significant source of pro-inflationary pressure in the economy. This is expressed through the impact of fiscal policy on the growth of money supply (M3), which since the beginning of the year grew by 7.9% or 2.4 trillion tenge. In 2022, the state budget expenditures are formed significantly higher than last year. The growth for 9 months of 2022 amounted to 18.9% in annual terms. The overwhelming growth of budget expenditures in the current year requires a compensating reaction from the monetary policy of the National Bank. The dynamics of economic activity is formed in accordance with the forecasts of the National Bank. In January-September 2022 GDP growth was 2.8%. The slowdown in business activity is mainly due to weak dynamics in the mining industry. Non-oil sectors make a positive contribution to GDP dynamics: manufacturing, construction, trade, information and communication, transport and agriculture. Consumer demand maintains a positive trend amid rising inflation. The volume of nominal retail turnover in the first nine months of 2022 increased by 15.7% compared to the previous year. Additional pro-inflationary pressure on the demand side is created by the growth of consumer lending to individuals (by 21.4% in January-September 2022 compared with the same period of 2021). External factors are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty. Prices on global food markets continue to decline, as evidenced by the FAO index. In September 2022, the index decreased by 1.1% (in annual terms - an increase of 5.5%). At the same time, an increase in wheat prices is observed due to the risks of grain export from the Ukrainian Black Sea ports and weather conditions in Argentina and the United States. Consumer inflation continues to accelerate in many countries. In the EU, inflation was 10.9% in September 2022. In Germany in particular, inflation accelerated from 8.8% to 10.9%. In the U.S., inflation has remained almost unchanged in spite of more aggressive U.S. Federal Reserve policy. In this environment, the monetary policy of most central banks continues to tighten, prioritizing the inflation target. For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate has been consistently raised from 0.25% to 3.25% since the beginning of this year. The outlook for further development of the global economy has been worsened again. The IMF forecasts for global economic growth in 2022 remained unchanged at 3.2%. At the same time, estimates for 2023 were lowered from 2.9% to 2.7%. High geopolitical risks, increased inflationary pressure and decline in economic activity in China remain the main constraints to global economic growth. The global oil market is characterized by multidirectional factors affecting prices. In the last month Brent oil prices have been fluctuating at the level of $8296 per barrel. Prices were declining against worsening of demand forecasts, as well as growth of reserves in the USA. Supply disruptions from Russia and some countries of the Middle East supported the growth in prices. The prices were also supported by reduction of the total production quota of OPEC+ by 2m barrels per day starting from November 2022. The EIA predicts the Brent price will average $93 per barrel in Q4 2022 and $95 per barrel in 2023. Important conditions for subsequent decisions will be the alignment of actual inflation with the forecasted trajectory, the dynamics of inflationary expectations of economic entities, as well as the balance of the above-mentioned risks in the external and internal environment. Taking into account the current situation, the potential for an increase in the base rate at the next meetings remains, and the National Bank intends to continue tightening monetary conditions, guided by the state of pro-inflation risks. The next scheduled decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on December 5, 2022 at 14:00 Astana time."
Euroarea,2022-10-27,"Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. The Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points. With this third major policy rate increase in a row, we have made substantial progress in withdrawing monetary policy accommodation. We took today's decision, and expect to raise interest rates further, to ensure the timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term inflation target. We will base the future policy rate path on the evolving outlook for inflation and the economy, following our meeting-by-meeting approach. Inflation remains far too high and will stay above our target for an extended period. In recent months, soaring energy and food prices, supply bottlenecks and the post-pandemic recovery in demand have led to a broadening of price pressures and an increase in inflation. Our monetary policy is aimed at reducing support for demand and guarding against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. The Governing Council also decided to change the terms and conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO . During the acute phase of the pandemic, this instrument played a key role in countering downside risks to price stability. Today, in view of the unexpected and extraordinary rise in inflation, it needs to be recalibrated to ensure that it is consistent with the broader monetary policy normalisation process and to reinforce the transmission of our policy rate increases to bank lending conditions. We therefore decided to adjust the interest rates applicable to TLTRO III from 23 November 2022 and to offer banks additional voluntary early repayment dates. Finally, in order to align the remuneration of minimum reserves held by credit institutions with the Eurosystem more closely with money market conditions, we decided to set the remuneration of minimum reserves at the ECB's deposit facility rate. The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website. The details of the changes to the TLTRO III terms and conditions are described in a separate press release to be published at 15:45 CET. Another technical press release, detailing the change to the remuneration of minimum reserves, will also be published at 15:45 CET. I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. Economic activity in the euro area is likely to have slowed significantly in the third quarter of the year, and we expect a further weakening in the remainder of this year and the beginning of next year. By reducing people's real incomes and pushing up costs for firms, high inflation continues to dampen spending and production. Severe disruptions in the supply of gas have worsened the situation further, and both consumer and business confidence have fallen rapidly, which is also weighing on the economy. Demand for services is slowing, after a strong performance in previous quarters when those sectors most affected by the pandemic-related restrictions reopened, and survey-based indicators for new orders in the manufacturing sector are falling. Moreover, global economic activity is growing more slowly, in a context of persistent geopolitical uncertainty, especially owing to Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine, and tighter financing conditions. Worsening terms of trade, as the prices paid for imports rise faster than those received for exports, are weighing on incomes in the euro area. The labour market continued to perform well in the third quarter, and the unemployment rate remained at the historically low level of 6.6 per cent in August. While short-term indicators suggest that jobs were still being created in the third quarter, the weakening of the economy could lead to somewhat higher unemployment in the future. To limit the risk of fuelling inflation, fiscal support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should be temporary and targeted at the most vulnerable. Policymakers should provide incentives to lower energy consumption and bolster energy supply. At the same time, governments should pursue fiscal policies that show they are committed to gradually bringing down high public debt ratios. Structural policies should be designed to increase the euro area's growth potential and supply capacity and to boost its resilience, thereby contributing to a reduction in medium-term price pressures. The swift implementation of the investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme will make an important contribution to these objectives. Inflation rose to 9.9 per cent in September, reflecting further increases in all components. Energy price inflation, at 40.7 per cent, remained the main driver of overall inflation, with an increasing contribution from gas and electricity prices. Food price inflation also rose further, to 11.8 per cent, as high input costs made food production more expensive. Supply bottlenecks are gradually easing, though their lagged impact is still contributing to inflation. The impact of pent-up demand, while weakening, is still driving up prices in the services sector. The depreciation of the euro has added to the build-up of inflationary pressures. Price pressures are evident in more and more sectors, in part owing to the impact of high energy costs feeding through to the whole economy. Measures of underlying inflation have thus remained at elevated levels. Among those measures, inflation excluding energy and food rose further to 4.8 per cent in September. Strong labour markets are likely to support higher wages, as is some catch-up in wages to compensate for higher inflation. Incoming wage data and recent wage agreements indicate that the growth of wages may be picking up. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent, although further above-target revisions to some indicators warrant continued monitoring. The incoming data confirm that risks to the economic growth outlook are clearly on the downside, especially in the near term. Confidence could deteriorate further and supply-side constraints could worsen again. Energy and food costs could also remain persistently higher than expected. A weakening world economy could be an additional drag on growth in the euro area. The risks to the inflation outlook are primarily on the upside. The major risk in the short term is a further rise in retail energy prices. Over the medium term, inflation may turn out to be higher than expected if there are increases in the prices of energy and food commodities and a stronger pass-through to consumer prices, a persistent worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy, a persistent rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than anticipated wage rises. By contrast, a decline in energy costs and a further weakening of demand would lower price pressures. Bank funding costs are increasing in response to the rise in market interest rates. Borrowing has also become more expensive for firms and households. Bank lending to firms remains robust, as they need to finance high production costs and build up inventories. At the same time, demand for loans to finance investment has continued to decline. Lending to households is moderating, as credit standards have tightened and demand for loans has decreased in a context of rising interest rates and low consumer confidence. Our most recent bank lending survey reports that credit standards tightened for all loan categories in the third quarter of the year, as banks are becoming more concerned about the deteriorating outlook for the economy and the risks faced by their customers in the current environment. Banks expect to continue tightening their credit standards in the fourth quarter. Summing up, today we have raised the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points, and expect to raise interest rates further, to ensure the timely return of inflation to our medium-term target. With this third major policy rate increase in a row, we have made substantial progress in withdrawing monetary policy accommodation. The changes to the terms and conditions of our targeted longer-term refinancing operations will also contribute to the ongoing policy normalisation process. Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term inflation target."
Egypt,2022-10-27,"October 27th, 2022 Press Release The global economy faced multiple shocks and challenges, the likes of which have not been seen in year. Recently global markets have been subject to the COVID- 19 pandemic that put the world on lockdown, followed by the Russo-Ukraine conflict, which had dire economic ramification. Consequently Egypt weathered large capital outflows and rising commodity price. Against this backdrop. Egypt is intent on intensifying its reform agenda to secure macroeconomic stability and achieve strong, sustainable and inclusive growt. To this end, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) moved to a durably flexible exchange rate regime, leaving the forces of supply and demand to determine the value of the EGP against other foreign currencies, while prioritizing the primary goal of achieving price stability, and building up sustainable, adequate levels of Foreign Exchange Reserve. To that end, the CBE will begin the process of gradually repealing Letter No. 49 of February 13th, 2022 that mandated the use of Letters of Credit for import finance, and the CBE will ensure the completion of removal by December 202. This will serve as a catalyst for the rejuvenation of economic activity in the medium ter. Additionally the CBE will work towards building the foundation for a derivatives market to further deepen the foreign exchange market and enhance its liquidit. Furthermore in order to uphold the CBE's mandate of ensuring price stability over the medium term, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided in its special meeting to raise the overnight deposit rate, the overnight lending rate and the rate of the main operation by 200 basis points to 1325 percent, 1425 percent, and 1375 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also raised by 200 basis points to 1375 percen. Elevated global and domestic prices are expected to keep headline inflation above the MPC's preannounced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4. The objective of raising policy rates is to anchor inflation expectations and contain demand side pressures, higher broad money growth and second round effects of supply shock. To further anchor inflation expectations, the MPC will continue to announce inflation targets along the predetermined disinflation path that began in 2017, which was on track until the emergence of the recent global shock. Achieving low and stable inflation over the medium term supports real incomes and sustains the achieved competitive gains of the Egyptian econom. The CBE will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to act in order to ensure price stabilit."
Colombia,2022-10-28,"In the discussion on monetary policy, the following elements were considered. During the previous month, adverse financial conditions worsened, brought on by global and idiosyncratic factors. These conditions caused =94among other effects=94 a higher monthly depreciation than that of other emerging economies. Total annual inflation rose from 10.8% to 11.4% from August to September. The increase in inflation is explained by additional pressure in food production costs, higher electricity prices, the exchange rate pass-through to tradable-goods, strong demand, and indexation processes for rising inflation rates. Basic inflation=94excluding food and regulated items=94went from 6.9% to 7.5% between August and September. Expected inflation measures continued to increase during the last month, steering away from the target. Banco de la Republica's monthly survey of economic analysts indicates an expected annual inflation rate of 6.7% for 2023, above last months' expected rate. Through to the economic tracking indicator (ISE), the annual growth for economic activity during August was 8.7%, driven by consumption growth as well as by investment in machinery and equipment. Technical staff's annual GDP growth forecast is 7.9% for 2022 and 0.5% for 2023. Despite the expected deceleration, the GDP forecast sets values 12% higher than those observed in 2019, prior to the pandemic. With the decision adopted in today's session, the Board of Directors continues the monetary policy adjustment process. This adjustment is consistent with the convergence of inflation in the medium term at its 3% target and with sustainable economic growth. The Board will make further decisions as deemed necessary based on new available information. Fecha de publicacion."
Russia,2022-10-28,"On 28 October 2022, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 7.50% per annum. Current growth rates of consumer prices as a whole remain low, contributing to a further slowdown in annual inflation. Inflation expectations of households and businesses are high and have slightly grown relative to the summer months. The updated forecast assumes inflation for the end of 2022 to total 12.013.0% and takes into account the preponed indexation of utility prices among other factors. The Bank of Russia assesses that the partial mobilisation will serve as a deterrent to consumer demand and inflation over the horizon of coming months. However, its subsequent effects will be pro-inflationary as it adds to supply-side restrictions. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as the risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will drop to 5.07.0% in 2023 to return to 4% in 2024. Inflation movements. Annual inflation continues to slow down gradually. In September, growth in consumer prices decelerated to 13.7% in annual terms (after 14.3% in August) and declined, as of 21 October, to 12.9%. In September, monthly prices increased their growth pace on a seasonally adjusted basis. That came in part on the back of a one-off rise in insurance and mobile tariffs. Stripping out the impact of one-off factors, the monthly growth pace of prices was also up but remained low. Flash estimates in October point to overall low current inflationary pressures. Despite the progressing decline in annual inflation, inflation expectations of households and businesses are high and have slightly grown relative to the summer months. Analysts' medium-term inflation expectations are anchored close to 4%. Under the Bank of Russia's baseline scenario, annual inflation is forecast to run at 12.013.0% by the end of 2022. The updated forecast of the Bank of Russia takes into account, among other factors, the preponed indexation of utility prices from July 2023 to December 2022. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will decline to 5.07.0% in 2023, return to 4% in 2024 and stabilise close to 4% further on. Monetary conditions remained overall neutral with a slight tightening despite the cut in the key rate in September. This comes largely as a result of growing geopolitical tensions. Against this backdrop. OFZ yields were up, the decline in credit rates came to a halt, and non-price conditions of bank lending tightened. Banks concurrently raised deposit rates in response to the flow of household funds from bank deposits to cash rubles. Despite elevated inflation expectations and an increased share of the most liquid assets (current accounts and cash rubles) in the structure of savings, households maintained a high propensity to save. Overall lending grew at a high pace. Lending gained support from both the key rate reduction since spring and government-subsidised lending programmes. However, signs emerged in October of a slowdown in credit activity including in the context of the tightening in non-price bank lending conditions, particularly in the retail segment. Economic activity. High-frequency indicators point to stronger dynamics of business activity in the third quarter than the Bank of Russia expected. A growing number of enterprises are adjusting to operate under external trade and financial restrictions. This is facilitated by a gradual diversification of suppliers of finished products, raw material and components, as well as by import substitution processes and forays into new markets including a refocus on domestic consumers. At the same time, surveys show that a significant proportion of enterprises are still confronted with difficulties in production and logistics. Also growing are restrictions in the labour market, driven in part by the partial mobilisation. While the partial mobilisation may mainly create disinflationary pressure in the coming months due to subdued consumer demand, its subsequent effects will be pro-inflationary as it adds to supply-side restrictions in the broader economy. In September, business and consumer sentiment slightly worsened due to a rise in overall uncertainty. In these conditions, the recovery of consumer activity, which remains restrained, slowed down. Concurrently, domestic demand was supported by fiscal policy measures, in particular by increased demand from the public sector. In its baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia forecasts a GDP contraction of 3.03.5% in 2022. In 2023, the GDP growth rate will remain negative at (-4.0)—(-1.0)%. However, the Bank of Russia expects that the Russian economy will start growing in the second half of 2023. Inflation risks. There is a balance between proinflationary and disinflationary risks over a short-term horizon. As to a medium-term horizon, proinflationary risks still dominate and have grown slightly since mid-September. A further escalation of external trade and financial restrictions, fragmentation of the global economy and the financial system could lead to a sharper decline in the Russian economy's potential than expected in the baseline scenario. Specifically, supply-side constraints may increase due to problems with the supply of equipment, slowly replenishing stocks of finished products, raw materials and components in the event of an escalation of negative trends in import dynamics. In turn, the materialisation of growing risks of a global recession may further weaken external demand for Russian exports and provoke a weaker ruble as a result. As for domestic conditions, proinflationary effects may be more serious than in the baseline scenario due to changes in the size of the labour force and the employment structure, including amid the partial mobilisation. Short-term proinflationary risks are also caused by high and unanchored inflation expectations, which are particularly sensitive to the ruble's exchange rate fluctuations. Under these conditions, the growth of the most liquid assets in the structure of household savings may spur increased consumer demand in the future. The most significant disinflationary risk for the baseline scenario is the continued high propensity of households to save amid increased general uncertainty, as well as the duration of households' adaptation to the new supply structure in consumer markets. A more rapid adaptation of the economy, accompanied by an active recovery of imports among other things may also have a disinflationary effect. Disinflationary effects of the record harvest in 2022 could also be more noticeable in the coming months. The movements of the economy and inflation largely depend on fiscal policy decisions. The Bank of Russia takes into account the decisions already made regarding the mid-term expenditure path of the federal budget and the fiscal system as a whole. In case of a further budget deficit expansion, tighter monetary policy may be required to return inflation to target in 2024 and keep it close to 4% further on. The Bank of Russia will make its further decisions on the key rate, taking into account actual and expected inflation movements relative to the target, the process of the structural transformation of the economy, as well as assessing risks from internal and external conditions and financial markets' response to these risks. Following the meeting of the Board of Directors regarding the key rate on 28 October 2022, the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 16 December 2022. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

United States,2022-11-02,"EDT November 2, 2022 Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Russia's war against Ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3-3/4 to 4 percent. The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. (more)In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C Williams. Vice Chair; Michael S Barr; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Susan M. Collins; Lisa D Cook; Esther L George; Philip N Jefferson; Loretta J Mester; and Christopher J Waller. -0- For media inquiries, please email media@frb.gov or call 202-452-2955."
Malaysia,2022-11-03,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to increase the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 2.75 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly increased to 3.00 percent and 2.50 percent, respectively. The global economy continues to be weighed down by rising cost pressures, tighter global financial conditions, and strict containment measures in China. These factors more than offset the support from positive labour market conditions, and the full reopening of most economies and international borders. Inflationary pressures were more persistent than expected due to strong demand, tight labour markets, and elevated commodity prices, despite improvements in global supply chain conditions. Consequently, many central banks are expected to continue raising interest rates to manage inflationary pressures. In particular, continued aggressive adjustments in US interest rates and expectations of a higher terminal rate in the US, have contributed to a persistently strong US dollar environment. This has resulted in higher volatility in financial markets, affecting other major and emerging market currencies, including the ringgit. Going forward, the global growth outlook will continue to face headwinds from tighter financial conditions amid elevated inflation in major economies and the domestic challenges in China. The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, including escalation of geopolitical tensions, worsening of domestic headwinds in China and potential energy rationing in Europe. For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators show that economic activity strengthened further in the third quarter, driven primarily by robust domestic demand. Going forward, despite the challenging global environment, domestic demand will remain the key driver of growth. Household spending will continue to be underpinned by improvements in labour market conditions and income prospects. Tourist arrivals have increased following the reopening of international borders and will further lift tourism-related sectors. Investment activity and prospects will be supported by the realisation of multi-year projects. Nevertheless, external demand is expected to moderate following softening global growth. Despite bouts of heightened volatility in the global financial and foreign exchange markets, these developments are not expected to derail Malaysia's growth. Domestic liquidity remains sufficient, with continued orderly functioning of the financial and foreign exchange markets. Financial institutions also continue to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers. These will ensure financial intermediation remains supportive of the economy. Downside risks to the domestic economy continue to stem from a weaker-than-expected global growth, higher risk aversion in global financial markets amid more aggressive monetary policy tightening in major economies, further escalation of geopolitical conflicts, and worsening supply chain disruptions. In line with earlier assessments, headline inflation is likely to have peaked in 3Q 2022 and is expected to moderate thereafter, albeit remaining elevated. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is projected to average closer to the upper end of the 2.0% - 3.0% forecast range in 2022, having averaged 2.7% year-to-date, given some demand-driven price pressures amid the high-cost environment. Moving into 2023, headline and core inflation are expected to remain elevated amid both demand and cost pressures, as well as any changes to domestic policy measures. The extent of upward pressures to inflation will remain partly contained by existing price controls, subsidies, and the remaining spare capacity in the economy. The balance of risk to the inflation outlook in 2023 is tilted to the upside and continues to be subject to domestic policy measures on subsidies, as well as global commodity price developments arising mainly from the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and prolonged supply-related disruptions. Against the backdrop of continued positive growth prospects for the Malaysian economy, the MPC decided to further adjust the degree of monetary accommodation. The adjustment would also pre-emptively manage the risk of excessive demand on price pressures consistent with the recalibration of monetary policy settings that balances the risks to domestic inflation and sustainable growth. At the current OPR level, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic growth. The MPC is not on any pre-set course, which means that monetary policy decisions will continue to depend on evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook to domestic inflation and growth. Any adjustments to the monetary policy settings going forward would continue to be done in a measured and gradual manner, ensuring that monetary policy remains accommodative to support sustainable economic growth in an environment of price stability. The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2023. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times during the year. The Monetary Policy Statement will be released at 3 p.m. on the final day of each MPC meeting. Schedule of Monetary Policy Committee Meetings for 2023. 18 and 19 January 2023 (Wednesday and Thursday). 8 and 9 March 2023 (Wednesday and Thursday). 2 and 3 May 2023 (Tuesday and Wednesday). 5 and 6 July 2023 (Wednesday and Thursday). 6 and 7 September 2023 (Wednesday and Thursday). 1 and 2 November 2023 (Wednesday and Thursday).

Romania,2022-11-08,"In its meeting of 8 November 2022, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual inflation rate went up in September to 15.88 percent, i.e. above the forecast, from 15.32 percent in August, mainly under the impact of continued hikes in processed food and electricity prices, only partly offset by lower fuel prices, amid declining oil prices. Thus, the 12-month inflation rate saw an increase in 2022 Q3 too, albeit much more subdued than in the previous quarters (from 15.05 percent in June), in the context of the deceleration in the aggregate dynamics of the exogenous CPI components during this period as a whole, primarily as a result of the drop in fuel prices, inter alia following the motor fuel price compensation. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate continued to climb at a sustained, faster-than-expected pace in Q3, albeit slower than in the first part of the year, going up to 11.9 percent in September, from 9.8 percent in June, owing almost entirely to the new rises in processed food prices. Thus, the evolution of this component continues to reflect the effects of large hikes in agri-food commodity prices and elevated energy and transport costs, alongside the influences of bottlenecks in production chains. These were further compounded in Q3 too by high short-term inflation expectations and the resilience of demand in certain segments, as well as by the significant share of food items and imported goods in the CPI basket. Annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP  inflation indicator for EU Member States) moved up to 13.4 percent in September, from 13.0 percent in June. Furthermore, average annual CPI inflation rate and average HICP inflation rate went up to 11.8 percent and 10.2 percent respectively in September, from 9.3 percent and 7.9 percent respectively in June 2022, remaining however below the levels prevailing in the region and the Baltic countries. The new statistical data reconfirm the significantly stronger-than-expected economic growth in 2022 Q2, albeit considerably slower than in the previous quarter, down to 1.8 percent from 5.3 percent in the first three months of the year, implying a moderate pick-up in the aggregate demand surplus during this period too. The slight deceleration in annual GDP growth in Q2 is also reconfirmed, to 5.1 percent, from 6.4 percent in Q1, yet amid a change in the structure of aggregate demand. Thus, during this period, the largest contribution to economic growth came from household consumption, with a modest one, albeit on the increase, stemming from gross fixed capital formation, while the contribution of the change in inventories turned negative again. In turn, net exports made a marginally larger expansionary contribution in Q2, given the further positive differential between the dynamics of exports of goods and services, in terms of volume, and those of imports thereof, both of which saw a slight decrease against Q1. Consequently, the fast annual pace of increase of the negative trade balance posted a mild slowing, inter alia in the context of the relative narrowing of the unfavourable differential between the upward change in import prices and that in export prices, while the annual growth of the current account deficit halved compared to the previous quarter's average, given also the improvement in the evolution of the primary income balance. The latest data and analyses point to a quasi-standstill of economic activity in 2022 Q3 and Q4, under the impact of the escalating war in Ukraine and the extension of the associated sanctions. Compared to the same year-earlier period, however. GDP will likely see a significant advance in Q3, on account of a base effect, but with a decelerating increase in private consumption. Relevant from this perspective is the notable slowdown in the annual dynamics. July through August, of retail trade and especially of services to households, counterbalanced only to a small extent by the slight recovery of motor vehicle and motorcycle trade. At the same time, industrial output saw a wider annual contraction in the first two months of Q3 overall, while construction works rebounded strongly against the same year-earlier period, mainly on account of those in the non-residential and civil engineering segments. However, imports of goods and services saw a significantly faster rise in annual terms in July-August, inter alia against the backdrop of adverse developments in external prices; their pace of increase was stronger than that of exports, which led to a renewed considerable step-up in the annual dynamics of trade deficit compared to the previous quarter's average, and a somewhat more modest re-acceleration of the annual dynamics of the current account deficit, given the substantial improvement in the primary income balance for the period as a whole. This deterioration in the terms of trade is common to many EU countries amid the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine. The number of employees in the economy stopped its increase in August, given the cut in the number of personnel in the private sector, while the ILO unemployment rate saw a renewed marginal advance at the end of Q3, after its decrease to 5.1 percent in August. At the same time, at the beginning of Q4, the labour shortage reported by companies remained flat at the lower level reached in the previous months, while hiring intentions for the near-term horizon recovered slightly, but in the context of mixed sectoral developments, probably explained by the very high energy costs, as well as by the uncertainties generated by the war in Ukraine and the related increasingly strict sanctions. The main interbank money market rates resumed growth in October under the influence of the increase in the monetary policy rate, yet at a slower pace. In turn, yields on government securities advanced more steeply during the first two 10-day periods of the month, before witnessing sizeable downward adjustments, similarly to developments in advanced economies and in the region, amid the improvement in global financial market sentiment and in the risk perception towards the region. Moreover, the average remuneration of new time deposits climbed further in September, albeit more mildly than in July-August, including for households. Against this background, reflecting also a relatively high attractiveness of investments in domestic currency, the leu posted again an appreciation trend versus the euro in October, only partly and temporarily reversed towards the end of the month. The annual dynamics of credit to the private sector saw its decrease come to a halt in September, staying at 16 percent (15.9 percent in August), as the renewed deceleration in the growth rate of the domestic currency component was counterbalanced by the sharper uptrend in the dynamics of foreign currency-denominated loans. As a result, the share of leu-denominated loans in credit to the private sector fell to 70.6 percent in September from 71.8 percent in August. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the November 2022 Inflation Report, which incorporates the latest available data and information. According to the updated forecast, the annual inflation rate is expected to grow mildly some more towards end-2022 and then to embark on a gradual downward path, which is seen declining to one-digit levels in 2024 H1 and steepening afterwards, although remaining slightly above the variation band of the target at the end of the projection horizon. The outlook for a reversal in the annual inflation rate path after reaching a plateau in 2022 Q4 relies on the softening impact of global supply-side shocks  inter alia in the context of energy price capping schemes implemented until August 2023 , as well as on increasingly manifest disinflationary base effects. To these add the influences from the likely contraction and rapid closing of the positive output gap, followed by the output gap widening into negative territory at a relatively faster pace starting in 2023 Q4. Uncertainties are, nevertheless, associated with the presumed impact, but also the duration of energy and fuel price capping and compensation schemes. At the same time, the supply-side risks to the current inflation outlook are tending to balance overall, amid the recent developments in key energy and agri-food commodity prices, as well the major determinants thereof. The escalation of the war in Ukraine and the related increasingly harsh sanctions generate, however, considerable uncertainties and risks to the outlook for economic activity, hence to medium-term inflation developments, through the possibly stronger effects exerted on consumer purchasing power and confidence, as well as on firms' activity, profits and investment plans, but also by potentially affecting more severely the European/global economy and the risk perception towards economies in the region, with an unfavourable impact on financing costs. Furthermore, the absorption of EU funds, especially those under the Next Generation EU programme, is conditional on fulfilling strict milestones and targets for implementing the approved projects. However, it is essential for carrying out the necessary structural reforms, energy transition included, but also for counterbalancing, at least in part, the contractionary impact of supply-side shocks, compounded by the war in Ukraine and by the tightening of economic and financial conditions worldwide. Major uncertainties and risks are associated, nonetheless, with the fiscal policy stance as well, given the requirement for further budget consolidation amid the excessive deficit procedure and the overall uptrend in the cost of financing, yet in a challenging economic and social environment domestically and globally, which led to the implementation of several packages of measures to support households and firms, with an impact on budget parameters. The characteristics of the upcoming budget revision in 2022 and the coordinates of the 2023 draft budget are important from this perspective. Also relevant are the ECB's and the Fed's monetary policy stances, as well as the behaviour of central banks in the region. In the meeting held today, 8 November 2022, based on the currently available data and assessments, as well as in light of the very elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 6.75 percent per annum from 6.25 percent per annum as of 9 November 2022. Moreover, it decided to raise the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 7.75 percent per annum from 7.25 percent per annum and the deposit facility rate to 5.75 percent per annum from 5.25 percent, as well as to maintain firm control over money market liquidity. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to keep the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to anchor inflation expectations over the medium term, as well as to foster saving through higher bank rates, so as to bring the annual inflation rate back in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat target on a lasting basis, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. At the current juncture, a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms inter alia by using EU funds to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand adverse developments. The NBR closely monitors developments in the domestic and international environment and will continue to use the tools at its disposal to achieve the fundamental objective of price stability in the medium term. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 14 November 2022 at 11:00 a.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 22 November 2022 at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board will be held on 10 January 2023."
Poland,2022-11-09,"Warsaw, 9 November 2022 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 9 November 2022 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ▪ reference rate at 6.75%; ▪ lombard rate at 7.25%; ▪ deposit rate at 6.25%; ▪ rediscount rate at 6.80%; ▪ discount rate at 6.85%. Incoming data indicate a deterioration of economic conditions abroad. 2022 Q3 saw a marked lowering of the annual GDP growth in the euro area and its stabilisation in the United States. At the same time, despite a favourable labour market situation in the largest economies, in October business condition indices deteriorated further. Activity in the global economy and its prospects are primarily negatively affected by the impact of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine, including high prices of commodities, food and production components, as well as by the tightening of monetary policy around the world. Meanwhile, there persists uncertainty regarding further impact of these shocks on economic conditions, and in particular  despite some lowering of gas prices in Europe over the recent period  there persists uncertainty regarding the impact of the situation in energy commodity markets on activity in the European economy in the coming quarters. Inflation in many economies is at the highest levels in decades, and in the euro area and in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe it is still on the rise. Significant source of high inflation continue to be high commodity prices, resulting partly from the repercussions of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine, as well as persistent  despite their easing  disruptions in global supply chains. Rising prices are also driven by demand factors and increasing labour costs. These factors, combined with the passing earlier rises in production cost on to the consumer goods prices, lead also to an increase in core inflation. Amidst high inflation, major central banks continued to tighten their monetary policy in the recent period. In particular, the US Federal Reserve and the ECB increased interest rates once again. 1/3 In Poland, available monthly data for 2022 Q3, including data on industrial production, construction and assembly output and retail sales, as well as business condition indices, signal that the annual GDP growth decelerated again. A further slowdown of GDP growth is forecast for the coming quarters, while the economic outlook is subject to significant uncertainty. Despite the decelerating GDP growth, labour market situation remains very good, which is reflected i.a. in a low unemployment rate. Inflation in Poland  according to Statistics Poland flash estimate  increased in October 2022 to 17.9% y/y. The increase in inflation in recent months has been mainly due to a gradual pass-through of high commodity prices to consumer prices. High commodity prices were reflected in rising food and energy prices. At the same time, they boosted operating costs of enterprises, which  given the still relatively high demand  inclined firms to raise prices of consumer goods, contributing to higher core inflation. Core inflation was also driven by the effects of the persisting  though gradually easing  disruptions to global supply chains. At the same time, the Anti-inflationary Shield continued to curb CPI inflation. The Council became acquainted with the results of the November projection of inflation and GDP based on the NECMOD model. In line with the projection prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 21 October 2022 and information on planned legislative changes announced until 7 November 2022, there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of 14.4  14.5% in 2022 (against 13.2  15.4% in the July 2022 projection), 11.1  15.3% in 2023 (compared to 9.8  15.1%), 4.1  7.6% in 2024 (compared to 2.2  6.0%) and 2.1  4.9% in 2025. At the same time, the annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 4.3  4.9% in 2022 (against 3.9  5.5% in the July 2022 projection), -0.3  1.6% in 2023 (compared to 0.2  2.3%), 1.0  3.1% in 2024 (compared to 1.0  3.5%) and 1.8  4.4% in 2025. The Council assessed, that the expected weakening of the external economic conditions, together with monetary policy tightening by major central banks, will curb global inflation and commodity prices. The weakening of the global economic conditions will also hamper GDP growth in Poland. Under such circumstances, the hitherto significant monetary policy tightening by NBP will support a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target. At the same time, given strength and persistence of the current shocks that remain beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, in the short term inflation will remain high, and its return to the NBP inflation target will be gradual. A decrease in 2/3 inflation would be faster if supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council's assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy. Further decisions of the Council will depend on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy. NBP will take all necessary actions in order to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability, including above all to reduce the risk of inflation remaining elevated. NBP may intervene in the foreign exchange market, in particular to limit fluctuations of the zloty exchange rate that are inconsistent with the direction of monetary policy."
Mexico,2022-11-10,"Available indicators anticipate a moderate expansion of world economic activity during the third quarter, although the outlook for 2023 has continued to deteriorate. Global inflation remains high and risks to the upside persist, although there are signs that pressures on primary goods and disruptions in supply chains have started to mitigate. Financial conditions remained tight. A large number of central banks continued raising their reference rates, some of them in a lesser-than-expected magnitude. These reference rates are foreseen to remain at high levels for an extended period. In its latest monetary policy decision, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points for a fourth consecutive time and anticipated additional increases. Among key global risks are those associated with the pandemic, the persistence of inflationary pressures, the intensification of geopolitical turmoil, and tighter monetary and financial conditions. The Mexican peso appreciated, thus showing greater resilience than other currencies. Short-term interest rates increased while medium- and long-term ones registered limited adjustments. The Mexican economy continued recovering during the third quarter. It exhibited a rate of expansion similar to that of the previous two quarters, higher than expected, reaching a level close to that registered prior to the onset of the pandemic. Slack conditions have continued decreasing. In October, headline inflation declined slightly to 8.41%, due to a reduction in its non-core component. Core inflation, however, continued trending upwards, reaching 8.42%. The accumulated pressures associated with both the pandemic and the military conflict have continued to affect headline and core inflation. Their expectations for 2022, 2023, and for the medium term rose again, while those for the long term remained stable, although above the target. For the short term, forecasts for headline inflation were revised marginally downwards, while those for core inflation were revised slightly upwards. Inflation is still projected to converge to the 3% target in the third quarter of 2024 (see Table). These projections are subject to risks. On the upside: persistence of core inflation at high levels; external inflationary pressures associated with the pandemic; greater pressures on agricultural and livestock product prices and on energy prices due to the ongoing geopolitical conflict; exchange rate depreciation; and cost-related pressures. On the downside: a greater-than-anticipated slowdown of the world economy; a decline in the intensity of the geopolitical conflict; a better functioning of supply chains; a lower pass-through effect from some cost-related pressures; and a larger-than-anticipated effect from the Federal Government's measures to fight elevated prices. Although some shocks show signs of subsiding, the balance of risks that might have an incidence on the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon remains biased to the upside. 1 The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the evolution of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process. It also considered the increasing challenges for monetary policy stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of significant uncertainty, the inflationary pressures accumulated as a result of the pandemic and the geopolitical conflict, the possibility of greater effects on inflation, and the monetary policy stance already attained in this hiking cycle. Based on these considerations, the Board decided by majority to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 75 basis points to 10.00%. With this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon. The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations. This, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times, with both the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets. In its next meetings, the Board will assess the magnitude of the upward adjustments to the reference rate based on the prevailing conditions. Voting in favor of the decision were Victoria Rodríguez. Galia Borja. Irene Espinosa, and Jonathan Heath. Gerardo Esquivel voted in favor of raising the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 9.75%. 2/ Forecast starting September 2022.

Peru,2022-11-10,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT OCTOBER 2022 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 7.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 25 bps to 7.25 percent, thus continuing to adjust its monetary policy stance. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation decreased from 8.53 percent in September to 8.28 percent in October, while core inflation increased from 5.51 percent in September to 5.72 percent in October, both above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The significant increase in international food and fuel prices since the second half of last year, accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in global inflation in magnitudes not seen in many years and towards levels significantly higher than the inflation targets of central banks, both in advanced and other economies in the region. A downward trend in year-on-year inflation is forecast, with a return to the target range in the second half of next year, due to a moderation of the impact of international food and fuel prices, and to a reduction in inflation expectations. One-year-ahead expected inflation decreased from 4.89 percent in September to 4.78 percent in October; and inflation in 2023 is expected at 4.19 percent, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most leading and expectations indicators for economic activity remain in pessimistic territory. The outlook for global economic activity this year and the next has deteriorated due to expected policy interest rate hikes in advanced economies, lower growth in China, and international conflicts. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants, including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, to consider changes in the monetary stance. The Board reaffirms its commitment to adopt necessary actions to ensure the return of inflation to the target range over the forecast horizon. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 5.25 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 7.75 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months and the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months. In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates based on the amount of the operations. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on December 7, 2022."
Philippines,2022-11-16,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to raise the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility by 75 basis points to 5.0 percent, effective tomorrow, 18 November 2022. Accordingly, the interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities will be set to 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. The BSP's latest baseline forecasts indicate a higher inflation path over the policy horizon, with average inflation breaching the upper end of the 2-4 percent target range in both 2022 and 2023 at 5.8 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. The forecast for 2024 has also risen slightly to 3.1 percent. In deciding to raise the policy interest rate anew, the Monetary Board noted that core inflation has risen sharply in October, indicating stronger pass- through of elevated food and energy prices as well as demand-side impulses on inflation. At the same time, the risks to the inflation outlook lean strongly toward the upside until 2023 while remaining broadly balanced in 2024. Upside risks are associated with elevated international food prices owing to higher fertilizer costs, trade restrictions, and adverse weather conditions. On the domestic front, the impact of weather disturbances on the prices of fruits and vegetables, supply disruptions in key food commodities such as sugar and meat, as well as pending petitions for transport fare hikes could also exert upward pressures on inflation. Meanwhile, the impact of a weaker-than-expected global economic recovery continues to be the main downside risk to the outlook. Given the increased likelihood of further second-round effects, persistent inflationary pressures, and the predominance of upside risks to the inflation outlook, the Monetary Board recognized the need for aggressive monetary policy action to safeguard price stability. With the strong growth of the economy in the third quarter of 2022, domestic demand is seen to hold firm owing to improved employment outturns, investment activity, and consumer spending. On the other hand, a sizeable adjustment in the policy interest rate will help insulate the economy from external headwinds and exchange rate fluctuations that could further entrench price pressures and potentially dislodge inflation expectations. The Monetary Board is also reassured by the timely non-monetary government interventions to mitigate the impact of persistent supply-side pressures on commodity prices, including those aimed at alleviating supply shortages and strengthening farm productivity. Looking ahead, the BSP will continue to take all necessary action to bring inflation back within the target band over the medium term, in keeping with its primary mandate to sustain price and financial stability."
Israel,2022-11-21,"Inflation in Israel is above the upper bound of the target range, at 5.1 percent over the past 12 months. Inflation can be seen across the board in a wide range of CPI components. One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market are within the target range, while one-year expectations from other sourcesare around the upper bound of the target range. Expectations from the capital market for the second year and onward are within the target range. Economic activity in Israel remains strong. The labor market remains tight, and the GDP level remains higher than the long-term trend. However, monetary policy tightening and moderation of activity abroad are expected to lead to some slowdown in economic activity in Israel as well, and a number of indicators are showing signs of the beginning of such a process. Home prices increased in the past 12 months by a rate significantly higher than the pace of recent years. However, the number of home purchases continues to decline, and the volume of new mortgages taken out in recent months declined significantly. Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel strengthened by 3 percent against the US dollar, and by 0.7 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. In contrast, the shekel weakened by 2.8 percent against the euro. Economic activity abroad is moderating, and the risk of a recession is increasing, mainly in Europe, in view of the continuing war in Ukraine and the energy crisis in Europe, high inflation and monetary tightening, and the slowdown in China. In contrast, the easing in the supply chains is continuing, with a decline in shipping costs. The Israeli economy is recording strong economic activity, accompanied by a tight labor market andan increase in the inflation environment. The Committee has therefore decided to continue the process of increasing the interest rate. The pace of raising the interest rate will be determined in accordance with activity data and the development of inflation, in order to continue supporting the attainment ofthe policy goals. For the file figures accompanying this notice, click here.pptx. Economic activity in Israel remains strong, and according to National Accounts data. GDP has been above the long-term trend line for the past four quarters (Figure 18). The labor market remains tight and in a full employment environment, although the most recent data indicate some moderation. Inflation in Israel is above the target range, and is being recorded in a wide range of CPI components. Since the previous interest rate decision, the CPI increased by 0.2 percent in September and by 0.6 percent in October. Inflation in the past 12 months is above the upper bound of the target range, at 5.1 percent (Figure 1). With that, inflation in Israel remains significantly lower than in most of the advanced economies (Figure 34). Net of energy and fruits and vegetables, inflation is 5 percent, and with the further neutralization of the effects of taxation and regulation, it is 4.7 percent (Figure 2). The pace of inflation of the nontradable components increased to 4.8 percent: partly in view of the increase in the housing services component. The annual pace of inflation of the tradable components also increased, to 5.4 percent, influenced by the contribution of travel abroad by Israelis. (Figure 3). In the Committee's assessment, the monetary tightening processes in Israeland abroad, and the moderation of demand alongside the easing of the supply chain difficulties and the decline in commodity prices, will act to moderate inflation. One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market are within the target range, and one-year expectations from the other sources are around the upper bound of the target range (Figure 5). Expectations for the second year and onward from the capital market are within the target range (Figure 6). In contrast, the shekel weakened by 2.8 percent against the euro (Figure 7). Economic activity is strong. National Accounts data show that in the third quarter. GDP grew by 5.8 percent compared with the third quarter last year, and by 2.1 percent in annual terms compared with the second quarter of this year (Figure 14). An analysis of the data shows that the GDP level remains higher than the precrisis trend for the fourth consecutive quarter. However, following the high growth recorded in the second quarter, the pace of growth slowed in the third quarter, with a decline in private consumption that mainly reflects a decline in the consumption of durable goods (Figure 15). Goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds) declined slightly in recent months, but remain higher than before the pandemic, and services exports remain very high (Figure 20). Goods imports are also high in all components (Figure 21). The indicators of economic activity continue to point to strong activity. The aggregate balance of the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey for October continues to reflect businesses' positive assessments of their situation (Figure 19). Companies in the manufacturing and construction industries continue to report an easing of the equipment and raw materials constraint, in view of the moderation of pressure in the global supply chains. However, this is also apparently due to a decline in global demand. The level of equipment and raw materials constraint remains higher than it was prior to the COVID-19 crisis (Figure 23). Alongside this, in recent months companies have been reporting an increase in the intensity ofthe lack of orders constraint, mainly a lack of export orders in the services and high-tech industries. The labor market remains tight, but in recent months, particularly in October, there has been a slight moderation in employment data. The unemployment rate for those aged 15+ increased to 4.1 percent (seasonally adjusted), and has been in an upward trend since June (Figure 25). The employment rate (60.9 percent) declined slightly, and is similar to its average level in 2019, prior to the crisis. The employment rate among the prime working ages (25-64) remains high, but the most recent data show some decline (Figure 24). In parallel, the demand for workers remains high. The number of job vacancies remains historically high, but the job vacancy rate continues to decline moderately (Figure 26). According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, there is a decline in businesses' expectations of expanding their employee numbers, with a significant decline in the high-teach manufacturing and hotels industries (Figure 16). In parallel, the intensity of the employee hiring constraint declined in most industries in recent months (Figure 17). According to data from August, wages increased and are above the precrisis trend, but in real terms, they are around the trend projected based on the precrisis trend (Figure 27). Home prices increased by 19.8 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 10), a significantly higher pace than in previous years. However, the number of housing transactions continues to decline, and the volume of new mortgages taken out in October declined significantly to NIS 6.1 billion (Figure 12). Rents increased by 0.5 percent in October. The annual pace of increase in the housing component of the Consumer Price Index continued to rise, to 6.2 percent in October. In the domestic capital market there were increases in the equity indices, and yields on long-term government bonds, as well as corporate bond spreads, remained virtually unchanged, with a decline in the balance of tradable debt. The balance of business credit from banks declined slightly in October, while the interest rate continued to increase. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, there was some increase in the financing constraints reported by small and medium businesses since August. However, on a historical level, the financing constraint remains relatively low in all segments. (Figure 13). Global economic activity continues to moderate, and the risk of a recession is increasing, particularly in Europe. A number of indicators continue to point to a slowdown of economic activity influenced by a number of factors. These include the continuing war in Ukraine and the energy crisis in Europe, high inflation and monetary tightening, and the slowdown in China due to the prolonged lockdowns. In contrast, the easing of the supply chain difficulties continues, with a decline in shipping costs. The investment houses revised their global growth forecasts for 2023 downward (Figure 28). The global purchasing managers' indices of both advanced economies and emerging markets indicate a slowdown in the pace of economic activity (Figure 29). The volume of activity in world tradeincreased in August, but the orders for export component of the Purchasing Managers Index, which is a leading indicator of the volume of trade in the coming months, remains at a level that reflects contraction. There were increases in the main global equity indices (Figure 37). Government bond yields remained virtually unchanged, after trading with high volatility throughoutthe recent period. Oil prices remained virtually unchanged. (Figure 31). The global inflation environment remains high. However, in most countries, particularly the US, there has been marked moderation. In most countries, the inflation indices are significantly higher than the central bank targets (Figure 32), and monetary tightening around the world therefore continues. However, some central banks are slowing their pace of monetary tightening, or signaling a more moderate pace of monetary tightening in the future. In the US, the annual increase in the CPI declined to 7.7 percent in October, lower than previousforecasts. The Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, and noted that it may slow the pace of interest rate increases at its next meeting or the one after it. However, it was emphasized that the interest rate would increase to levels higher than predicted in the September forecast. In the eurozone, the rapid increase in inflation continues, and the overall index was at 10.6 percent in October. The ECB increased its interest rate by 75 basis points for the second consecutive time. In the UK, inflation continues to increase sharply, and reached 11.1 percent in October. The Bank of England's monetary contraction policy continues."
Hungary,2022-11-22,"At its meeting on 22 November 2022, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 23 November 2022:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. The risk of recession in the global economy has increased further due to the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war, the European energy crisis and the generally rising interest rate environment. The effects of the exceptional drought in Europe are expected to push inflation rates up further over the short term; however, signs of an impending turnaround have clearly appeared in commodity markets. Growing recession risks, alongside falling global energy and commodity prices and international freight costs, point to a moderation in global inflation from 2023. There has been significant volatility in risk appetite over the past month. At the beginning of the period, risk aversion increased in response to monetary policy decisions by the world's leading central banks and incoming macroeconomic data from Europe and the US, followed by an improvement in risk appetite; however, developments in the war continue to be a source of significant uncertainty in the CEE region. Global prices of most commodities have fallen in recent months but remained at high levels. Oil prices have fallen slightly, while gas prices in European markets have not changed significantly since the previous interest rate decision. The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank raised interest rates in line with expectations. In the CEE region, the Czech and the Polish central banks left interest rate conditions unchanged. The Romanian central bank continued its cycle of interest rate hikes. Hungarian economic growth slowed in 2022 Q3. The country's GDP grew by 4 percent relative to a year earlier, with industry and market services being the main contributing sectors. By contrast, the significant decline in agricultural output acted as a brake on growth. In September, both industrial production and construction output increased on a year-on-year basis. Retail sales have been expanding at a declining pace since March, while sales excluding fuels have been weakening since July. The labour market continues to be tight, and the unemployment rate is low. The economic slowdown and the effects of high energy prices are increasingly reflected in a general deterioration in sentiment indicators. The components of domestic demand are expected to be the main contributors to growth throughout this year. In 2023, growing precaution and a higher level of energy and food prices than before will cause household consumption to decrease. Rising costs and more uncertain demand prospects may induce companies to postpone investments, while the rescheduling of public development projects will also restrain investment activity. Net exports are expected to make a positive contribution to GDP growth again from the end of 2023 as external markets and supply chains recover. In October 2022, annual inflation was 21.1 percent and core inflation stood at 22.3 percent. The increase in inflation was mainly explained by a pick-up in food price inflation. The rate of core inflation excluding processed food prices rose relative to September but continued to be below the excessively high levels of the summer months. Inflation expectations continue to be elevated; however, companies' expectations for retail and services prices have remained below their peak levels seen in the summer. In recent months, inflation in Hungary was mainly driven by items outside the scope of monetary policy. As a result of the exceptional drought and the pass-through of high energy prices, inflation will rise further at a declining pace in the coming months. The easing in external inflationary pressures and in the cost shocks from freight costs and commodity prices, the slowdown in global economic growth and the downward pressure on prices, resulting from shrinking domestic demand, are expected to become more pronounced in the development of domestic prices from early 2023, leading to a gradual turnaround in inflation. Tight monetary conditions contribute to avoiding second-round inflationary effects and anchoring inflation expectations. There are symmetric risks to the outlook for inflation. The consumer price index may average between 13.514.5 percent in 2022. Domestic inflation will decrease slowly in the first half of 2023, and then more significantly from the middle of the year. The consumer price index will return to the central bank tolerance band in the first half of 2024. The measures announced by the Government and their implementation are expected to ensure the achievement of this year's budget deficit target indicated by the Ministry of Finance. Thus, the government debt-to-GDP ratio will decrease to close to 76 percent of GDP by the end of 2022. The current account deficit started to decline in the autumn months, in parallel with the decline in gas prices and the adjustment in domestic demand; however, it is expected to continue rising temporarily in 2022, due to the import-increasing effect of high energy prices. Subsequently, the increasing surplus in items of the current account excluding the energy balance and growing adjustment in the energy market might lead to a rapid improvement supported by the decrease in energy prices. By 2024, with the normalisation of the global economic environment and the pick-up of the production of significant new export capacities built in recent years, the external balance position is expected to improve significantly. In line with its previous communication, the Monetary Council kept the base rate at 13.00 percent at its meeting today. In addition, the O/N deposit rate and the O/N collateralised borrowing rate were left unchanged at 12.50 percent and 25.00 percent, respectively. The current level of the base rate is adequate to manage fundamental inflation risks, while monetary policy tightening continues with the reduction of interbank liquidity. The MNB will hold a two-month deposit tender at the end of November to tie up banking sector liquidity over a longer term. Furthermore, from the beginning of December the Bank will again hold FX swap tenders providing euro liquidity and discount bill auctions with maturities extending beyond the end of the year. With its active market presence, the MNB will further increase the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. The targeted measures taken by the Bank in mid-October led to an improvement in financial market stability in a rapidly changing risk environment. The one-day deposit quick tenders and FX swap transactions result in tighter interest rate conditions at the short end of the yield curve. The MNB meets directly major foreign currency liquidity needs arising from covering net energy imports over the period to the end of the year, while the Bank continuously takes into account considerations regarding the adequacy of foreign currency reserves, looking ahead as well. In recent months, domestic economic agents have begun to adjust to the energy market through a decline in energy consumption. This, along with a fall in energy prices, allows to maintain balance in the foreign exchange market by providing less foreign currency liquidity than earlier expected. In the Monetary Council's assessment, maintaining the current level of the base rate for a prolonged period is consistent with the achievement of the price stability objective over the monetary policy horizon. The instruments absorbing forint liquidity, announced for the end of the year, improve further the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. Maintaining market stability in a rapidly changing risk environment continues to be crucial to achieving price stability. The MNB focuses on sustained shifts in financial market conditions, and it will use its instruments introduced in mid-October until a trend improvement in risk perceptions occurs. Tight monetary conditions will be maintained over a prolonged period, which will ensure that inflation expectations are anchored, and the inflation target is achieved in a sustainable manner."
Nigeria,2022-11-22,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 145 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON MONDAY 21st AND TUESDAY 22nd NOVEMBER 2022 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 21st and 22nd of November 2022, confronted with the continued weakening of the global economy due primarily to the persistent increase in energy prices, supply chain bottlenecks, rising inflation, looming food crisis, and sharp increase in interest rates leading to tightening external financial conditions. The volatility of the oil market, driven by policy stance by OPEC+ and the US Government, is also creating considerable uncertainty in the market, thus making the overall direction relatively unclear. Moreover global trade has dwindled significantly in 2022, with the outlook for 2023 looking rather weak. Global private and public debt portfolios remain high and, in some cases, expanding as several countries around the globe acquire debt to stay afloat. The Committee appraised these and other developments in the global and domestic economies, as well as the outlook for the rest of the year and into the first quarter of 2023. Eleven (11) members of the Committee attended this meeting. Global Economic Developments Global output growth remained weighed down by familiar headwinds arising from the war in Ukraine. China's zero-COVID policy and the ongoing normalization of monetary policy in the advanced economies. These have collectively resulted in an energy price shock, historically high levels of price development across several economies and dwindling investment in capital markets of emerging market economies. With the war in Ukraine showing no signs of abating in the near-term, the disruptions to energy and commodity markets associated with it are more than likely to persist well into 2023. CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall While the pandemic has mostly dissipated in most parts of the world. China's zero-COVID policy is keeping its impact very significant as the frequent lockdowns in major industrial cities, continue to derail the smooth functioning of the global supply chain. Consequently the resulting macroeconomic uncertainties and associated shock spillovers, remain heightened, thus increasing the risk of a global recession which would severely retard the recovery of several fragile economies. Those to be most affected would be Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) still confronted with the lag impact of the 2020 recession. The ongoing capital flow reversal from perceived higher risk emerging market securities to US dollar denominated securities with improved yields, is also further hindering orderly global recovery to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), having downgraded for 2022 and 2023 several times, retained global output growth at 32 per cent for 2022, but further downgraded the 2023 forecast to 27 per cent compared with 29 per cent in its July 2022 forecast. Inflation across several Advanced Economies is expected to remain elevated in 2022, despite progressive rate hikes by several central banks in these economies. This is predicated on sustained high energy prices associated with the Ukraine war and continued disruptions to the global supply chain. In the Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDES), inflation is expected to remain high for other reasons including, the persistence of exchange rate pressures, dwindling capital inflows and a host of legacy structural issues. In the global financial markets, activities in several equity markets have gradually declined as investors take advantage of improved fixed-income yields in the Advanced Economies, with the progressive hike of policy rates. Global financial conditions are thus, expected to continue to tighten in the near term, as risk-averse investors reassign their portfolios. CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall In general, therefore, the global economy and financial markets, are confronted with significant risks in the short to medium-term. The huge build-up of both private and public debt and the rising risk of default associated with the current trend of rising interest rates, disruptions to the energy market and poorly functioning supply chains may tip several fragile economies into a new era of recession. Domestic Economic Developments Data from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) showed that it grew by 354 per cent (year-on-year) in the second quarter of 2022 and 501 per cent in the corresponding period of 2021. The economy has thus, sustained positive output growth for seven consecutive quarters, following the exit from recession in 2020. The consistent positive performance recorded was driven largely by the positive growth in the non-oil sector, particularly in the services and agricultural sub-sectors, complemented by continued policy support by the Bank. CBN Staff projections showed that the economy is expected to remain on a path of sustained positive growth, given the expected strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2022 and steady rebound in economic activities. Members noted with concern, the persisting uptick in inflation for the ninth consecutive month with headline inflation (year-on-year) rising to 2109 per cent in October 2022 from 2077 per cent in September 2022, an increase of 032 percentage point. On month-on-month basis, however, headline inflation decelerated to 124 per cent in October 2022 from 136 per cent in the preceding month, an indication that price development is responding to the Bank's recent policy rate hikes. The persisting uptrend in energy prices and the prolonged period of scarcity of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), contributed to a sharp rise in transportation, logistics and manufacturing costs, which fed through to consumer prices. Other contributory legacy factors include the lingering insecurity across the country; 3 CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall perennial flooding in major food producing states; critical deficit of infrastructure in the country; and poor road networks amongst others. The Committee noted that broad money supply (M3) grew further by 1380 per cent in October 2022, (year-to-date) compared with 1100 per cent in September, 2022. This growth was driven by increased claims on ‘Other Sectors' (other financial corporations, public non-financial corporations, and private sector). In the financial markets, money market rates oscillated below and within the asymmetric corridor of the discount window facilities, in tandem with fluctuating liquidity conditions in the banking system. Consequently the monthly weighted average Open Buy Back (OBB) rate increased to 1591 per cent in October 2022 from 1149 per cent in September 2022. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of the banking system declined in October 2022 to 134 but remained within its prudential limit of 100 -150 per cent. At 401 per cent, the Liquidity Ratio (LR) was above its prudential limit of 300 per cent. The Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio also improved to 48 per cent in October 2022 from 49 per cent in the previous month, staying below its prudential benchmark of 50 per cent. The MPC thus, called on the Bank to continue to maintain its tight surveillance over the banking system to ensure that the NPLs ratio remains below the prudential benchmark. The MPC noted with concern the continuing bearish performance of the equities market in the review period. The All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalization (MC) decreased to 43,,83908 and N2388 trillion on October 31, 2022, from 49,,83651 and N2688 trillion respectively, on August 31, 2022. This decrease reflected the sustained sell-off and profit taking by investors rebalancing their portfolios to benefit from higher yields in the fixed income market. Other contributory factors include inflationary and exchange rate pressures, and tightening external financial conditions. CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall The Committee observed the decline in the external reserves position, as gross external reserves decreased by 134 per cent at end-October 2022 to US$3687 billion, from US$3739 billion at end-September 2022. With indications of lower crude oil prices in the futures market. Members urged the Bank to sustain its current policies to boost non-oil exports in order to shore up the external reserves. Between September and October 2022, under the Anchor Borrowers' Programme (ABP), the Bank disbursed N4102 billion to several agricultural projects, bringing the cumulative disbursement under the Programme to ₦1,,06729 billion to over 46 million smallholder farmers cultivating 21 commodities across the country. The Bank also disbursed N030 billion to finance large-scale agricultural projects under the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme (CACS). Consequently, the total disbursement under the Scheme for agro-production and agro-processing stands at ₦74531 billion for 680 projects. In addition, the Bank released the sum of ₦4830 billion under the ₦10 trillion Real Sector Facility to seven new real sector projects in agriculture, manufacturing, and services. Cumulative disbursement under this Facility currently stands at ₦215 trillion to 437 projects across the country, comprising projects in manufacturing (240), agriculture (91), services (93) and mining sector (13). Furthermore under the 100 for 100 Policy on Production and Productivity (PPP), the Bank disbursed the sum of ₦2078 billion to nine projects in healthcare, manufacturing, and services. The cumulative disbursement under the Facility therefore, amounted to ₦11417 billion in 71 projects. Moreover the Bank disbursed ₦400 billion under the Intervention Facility for the National Gas Expansion Programme (IFNGEP) to promote the adoption of compressed natural gas (CNG) for transportation and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking. In support of the resilience of the healthcare sector, the Bank also disbursed ₦502 billion to four healthcare projects under the Healthcare Sector Intervention Facility (HSIF), bringing the cumulative disbursement to ₦13556 billion for 135 projects in pharmaceuticals (33), hospitals (60) and other services (42). CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall Under the Micro. Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector, the Bank provided support for entrepreneurship development with the disbursement of N133 billion and N1000 million under the Agribusiness/Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme (AgSMEIS) and Micro. Small, and Medium Enterprise Development Fund (MSMEDF), respectively. Hence the total disbursement under these interventions amounted to N15022 billion and N9608 billion, respectively. Under the Export Facilitation Initiative (EFI), the Bank provided support for export-oriented projects to the tune of N534 billion, such that the cumulative disbursement under this intervention stands at N4458 billion. Outlook The overall medium-term outlook for both the global and domestic economies remain clouded by uncertainties associated with the Russia-Ukraine war, lingering COVID-19 pandemic and continued lockdown of major industrial cities in China. The persistent tightening of global financial conditions and slowing global trade are also significant pointers to a weakening global economy. On the domestic front, available data on key macroeconomic indicators suggest rebound in output growth for the rest of 2022, which may occur at a much-slower pace than earlier anticipated, in the light of unfolding domestic and external shocks to the economy. The domestic shocks originate from the persisting insecurity inhibiting economic agents; rising cost of debt and debt servicing; deteriorating fiscal balances; increased spending as the 2023 general elections approach; and continued uptrend in inflationary pressure. Accordingly the Nigerian economy is forecast to grow in 2022 by 330 per cent (CBN), 320 per cent (IMF) and 420 per cent (FGN). The Committee's Considerations At this meeting, the MPC was concerned that the global inflationary pressures have continued to trend higher and financial markets were also facing challenges. It observed that this was indeed the trend in Nigeria, with inflation attaining 2109 per cent in October, 2022. The Committee, however, seized the opportunity to appraise the efficacy of its decisions at the last couple of 6 CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall meetings, and came up with the conclusion that the decisions were beginning to yield the desired results, given that the rate of increase in inflation was beginning to moderate , in view of the month-on-month deceleration in prices presented by the Consumer Price Index. Members noted that though the global economy was progressively weakening due to the various headwinds derailing the recovery, domestic output growth remained positive as a result of the combined support from fiscal and monetary policy. The MPC, therefore, urged both authorities to continue to harmonize their various policies to achieve the desired objectives of stable prices and steady growth. In reaching the decision of whether to loosen, hold or tighten the stance of policy. Committee felt that, given that all the causative factors, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, supply chain disruptions, slowdown in China, rising inflation in advanced economies and other headwinds were still dominant, a loosen option was not desirable at this meeting. The Committee also felt that, with the rising inflation, loosening the stance of policy would lead to a more aggressive rise in inflation and erode the gains already achieved through tightening. As regards whether to hold. MPC was of the view that a hold stance at a period close to December festive season and expected heavy spending during the 2023 general election at a time of high inflation would greatly jeopadise the gains of the previous policy rates hikes and plunge the economy deeper into the inflation trap. The MPC therefore decided to continue to tighten, but at a somewhat lower rate, noting that tightening the stance of policy would narrow the negative real effective interest margin and thus improve market sentiment and further restore investor confidence. MPC also felt that recent developments in terms of observed month-on-month deceleration in the rate of increase in inflation, suggests that the previous tightening policies were yielding the expected outcome. It therefore felt that sustaining the tightening would further consolidate the decline in inflation, albeit more significantly. CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall The Committee's Decision The MPC noted that inflation has continued an uptrend, even though at a decelerating rate, despite its last three consecutive sizeable policy rate hikes. The Committee's choices were on whether to further hike rates or pause for the impact of the last three rate hikes to continue to feed through the economy. At this MPC, therefore, the options considered were primarily to hold or further tighten the policy rate. The option to loosen was not considered as this would gravely undermine the gains of the last three rate hikes. The Committee thus voted unanimous to raise the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR). Nine members voted to raise the MPR by 100 basis points and 2 members voted to raise the MPR by 50 basis points. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Raise the MPR to 165 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 325 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor.

South Korea,2022-11-24,"The bank of korea. Monetary Policy Decision. (Statement). The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 3.00% to 3.25%. The Board judges that the policy response to ensure price stability should be continued as inflation has remained high. The size of the Base Rate hike was judged to be appropriate at 25bp, in overall consideration of the easing of risks in the foreign exchange sector and the contraction of short-term financial markets, while the economic slowdown is expected to be greater than forecast in August. Currently available information suggests that the global economic slowdown has continued, affected by the high inflation, ongoing policy rate hikes in major countries and the prolonged Ukraine crisis. In global financial markets, the US dollar has weakened and long-term market interest rates have fallen, as risk aversion has partly subsided on the expectations of an adjustment to the pace of the US Federal Reserve's policy rate hikes. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the movements of international commodity prices and global inflation, monetary policy changes in major countries and US dollar trends, and geopolitical risks. Domestic economic growth has continued to slow with exports shifting to a decrease, although private consumption has maintained its recovery trend. Labor market conditions have continued to be favorable with a low unemployment rate, despite a slowing increase in the number of persons employed. Going forward, domestic economic growth is expected to weaken, affected by the global economic slowdown and the increase in interest rates. GDP growth for this year will be consistent with the August forecast of 2.6%, but that for next year is projected to be 1.7%, considerably lower than the August forecast of 2.1%. Consumer price inflation has remained high at 5.7% in October due to increases in electricity and gas fees and the accelerating price increases in processed food products, although increases in the prices of petroleum products have moderated. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) and the inflation expectations of the general public have stayed high at the lower-4% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will somewhat decrease due to the base effect and the economic slowdown, but will remain high at the 5% level for some time. Consumer price inflation is projected to be 5.1% in 2022 and 3.6% in 2023, slightly below the August forecast of 5.2% in 2022 and 3.7% in 2023, but uncertainties are judged to be high related to the movements of exchange rates and global oil prices, the degree of economic slowdown at home and abroad, and the size of increases of electricity and gas fees. In the financial and foreign exchange markets, the long-term Korean Treasury bond yield and Korean won to US dollar exchange rate have decreased and stock prices have risen due to expectations of an adjustment to the pace of monetary tightening in major countries. However, in the short-term financial markets, yields on project financing asset-backed commercial paper (PF-ABCP) have risen significantly and their transactions have shrunk. Household loans have increased only slightly and housing prices have further decreased in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon as it monitors economic growth, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board sees continued rate hikes as warranted for some time, as inflation is expected to remain high, substantially above the target level, although the domestic economic growth rate has slowed. In this process the Board will determine the size and pace of further increases of the Base Rate while thoroughly assessing the degree of persistence of high inflation, the pace of growth, monetary policy changes in major countries, financial stability conditions, and geopolitical risks. Opening Remarks to the Press Conference (November 24, 2022). Today, the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) of the Bank of Korea decided to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 3.00% to 3.25%. I'll first go over financial and economic conditions both at home and abroad, and then explain the background to today's Base Rate decision in detail. First, looking at the changes in external conditions since the October MPB meeting, the global economic slowdown continued, due to high inflation and the resultant policy rate hikes in major countries. Specifically, the US economy has seen slowing growth, led by domestic demand. There has been growing concern about economic recession in the euro area, due to energy supply disruptions and heightened price level. The Chinese economy remains sluggish due to declines in property investment and exports. As for the global financial markets, the US Federal Reserve suggested in its November FOMC meeting that it could adjust the pace of its policy rate hikes, although the terminal federal funds rate could be higher than previously expected, and US price indicators also came in below market expectations. Accordingly, risk aversion, which had been greatly heightened, has partially eased. Consequently, the US dollar has weakened significantly, long-term market interest rates in major countries have fallen, and stock prices have risen. Our domestic economic growth has continued to slow. Although consumption has maintained its recovery momentum, export growth has been slowing rapidly, with exports shifting to a decline in October due to weakening growth in major countries. Turning to inflation conditions, consumer price inflation remained high at 5.7% in October. Although the rise in the prices of petroleum products has slowed, electricity and gas fees have increased further, and prices of processed food have climbed faster. Core inflation and the inflation expectations of the general public are running at 4.2-4.3%. In the domestic financial markets, long-term Treasury bond yields have declined and stock prices have risen, as the foreign exchange rate stabilized. However, in the money market, interest rates such as those on project financing asset-backed commercial paper have risen sharply, and transactions have shrunk. Such transactions are partially resuming, assisted by market stabilization measures by the Bank of Korea and the government. However, funding in the CP market is still constrained due to credit risk aversion, which has heightened sharply since the Legoland incident, and year-end demand for funds by financial institutions. In the foreign exchange market, strains have been partially eased with the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate falling to mid-1,300 won from the mid-1,400 won level. However, the exchange rate is expected to remain highly volatile for some time, as there are still high uncertainties related to the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy. China's Zero-COVID policy, and the resultant movements of the yuan. Looking at household debt and the housing market, household loans have increased slightly, as the sustained net redemption of unsecured loans offset a rise in housing-related lending. Housing prices have further decreased in both the Seoul metropolitan area and other regions. In reflection of changes in domestic and external conditions since the August economic outlook, the Bank of Korea has revisited its inflation and growth forecasts. Domestic growth is expected to be lower than previously projected, affected by the global economic slowdown and interest rate increases. The GDP growth rate for this year is projected to be in line with the August forecast of 2.6%, but the growth rate for next year is forecast to be 1.7%, substantially lower than the previous forecast of 2.1%, as exports and investment are likely to be more sluggish than expected along with a moderate recovery in consumption. The lowering of the growth rate for next year is attributed mostly to external factors such as an accelerated slowdown of the global economy, and partially to internal factors such as interest rate increases. Consumer price inflation is expected to be 5.1% for this year and 3.6% for next year, slightly lower than the August forecasts (5.2% and 3.7%). Despite the projection that the economy would slow further, the downward adjustment to the price forecasts has not been large. This is because the accumulated cost pressure, which has been gradually reflected in electricity and gas fees, processed food, and core items, is expected to largely offset the weakening of the demand pressure from the economic slowdown. With regard to the price forecasts, there are high uncertainties surrounding movements in the exchange rate and oil prices, the degree of economic slowdown at home and abroad, and the size of hikes in electricity and gas fees. Particularly in November. Consumer price inflation could be considerably lower than in October due to the base effects of agricultural and petroleum prices, however the high upward trend at the 5% level is projected to continue through early next year, reflecting the expectation of further increases in electricity and gas fees. The Director General of our Research Department will provide more details about the economic outlook this afternoon. The Board decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points. The Board sees it warranted to continue its policy response for price stability as inflation is projected to remain high at the 5% level for some time. Regarding the size of the rate hike, the Board judged that today's 25 basis-point increase is appropriate, given that the degree of economic slowdown is expected to increase in the future, while the risks in the foreign exchange sector have subsided and funding conditions in short-term financial markets have become constrained. All the Board members supported the decision unanimously. Looking ahead, the Bank of Korea deems it warranted to maintain its stance of Base Rate hikes going forward for some time, as inflation is projected to run well above the target level for a considerable time. There are different views among the Board members regarding the level and the timing of the policy rate destination due to high uncertainties surrounding the policy decision. Therefore, the Board will determine the Base Rate in the meetings next January and beyond after closely monitoring policy decisions of the US Federal Reserve, including in the December FOMC meeting, their influence on the foreign exchange market, changes in external conditions such as movements in international commodity prices, the pace of domestic inflation and growth, and financial stability conditions."
Turkiye,2022-11-24,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 10.5 percent to 9 percent. The weakening effects of geopolitical risks on global economic activity continue to increase. Global growth forecasts for the upcoming period are being revised downwards and recession is increasingly assessed as an inevitable risk factor. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the upward trend in producer and consumer prices continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. Moreover, central banks in advanced economies emphasize that the rise in inflation may last longer than previously anticipated due to high level of energy prices, imbalances between supply and demand, and rigidities in labor markets. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue to increase due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. A strong growth was observed in the first half of 2022. Leading indicators for the second half of the year continue pointing to a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand. Pressures on the manufacturing industry due to foreign demand and their currently limited impact on domestic demand and supply capacity have been more pronounced. Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues. On the other hand, high course of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. In addition, the spread between policy rate and the loan interest rates driven by the announced macroprudential measures is closely monitored. The Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and implement additional measures. The comprehensive set of policies to be implemented will be published in the 2023 Monetary and Exchange Rate document in December. Increase in inflation is driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. The effects of slowing foreign demand on aggregate demand conditions and production are closely monitored. It is critically important that financial conditions remain supportive for the sustainability of structural gains in supply and investment capacity by preserving the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as further escalation of geopolitical risks. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to reduce the policy rate by 150 basis points. Considering the increasing risks regarding global demand, the Committee evaluated that the current policy rate is adequate and decided to end the rate cut cycle that started in August. To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Pakistan,2022-11-25,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement November 25, 2022. At today's meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the policy rate by 100 basis points to 16 percent. This decision reflects the MPC's view that inflationary pressures have proven to be stronger and more persistent than expected. It is aimed at ensuring that elevated inflation does not become entrenched and that risks to financial stability are contained, thus paving the way for higher growth on more sustainable basis. Amid the on-going economic slowdown, inflation is increasingly being driven by persistent global and domestic supply shocks that are raising costs. In turn, these shocks are spilling over into broader prices and wages, which could de-anchor inflation expectations and undermine medium-term growth. As result, the rise in cost-push inflation cannot be overlooked and necessitates monetary policy response. The MPC noted that the short-term costs of bringing inflation down are lower than the long-term costs of allowing it to become entrenched. At the same time, curbing food inflation through administrative measures to resolve supply-chain bottlenecks and any necessary imports remains high priority. Since the last meeting, the MPC noted three key domestic developments. First headline inflation increased sharply in October, as the previous month's administrative cut to electricity prices was unwound. Food prices have also accelerated significantly due to crop damage from the recent floods, and core inflation has risen further. Second sharp decline in imports led to significant moderation in the current account deficit in both September and October. Despite this moderation and fresh funding from the ADB, external account challenges persist. Third after incorporating the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment of the floods and latest developments, the FY23 projections for growth of around percent and current account deficit of around percent of GDP shared in the last monetary policy statement are re-affirmed. However higher food prices and core inflation are now expected to push average FY23 inflation up to 21-23 percent. Real sector. Economic activity has continued to moderate since the last MPC meeting on account of transient disruptions from floods and on-going policy and administrative measures. In October, most demand indicators showed double-digit contraction on yearly basis—including sales of cement. POL, and automobiles. On the supply side, electricity generation declined for the fifth consecutive month, falling by. percent (y/y). In the first quarter of FY23. LSM production was flat relative to last year, with only export- oriented sectors contributing positively. In agriculture, latest estimates suggest sizeable output losses to rice and cotton crops from the floods which, together with tepid growth in manufacturing and construction, will weigh on growth this year. External sector. The current account deficit continued to moderate during both September and October, reaching $0. and $0. billion, respectively. Cumulatively the current account deficit during the first four months of FY23 fell to $2. billion, almost half the level during the same period last year. This improvement was mainly driven by broad-based 1. percent fall in imports to $20. billion, with exports increasing by. percent to $9. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN billion. On the other hand, remittances fell by. percent to $9. billion, reflecting widening gap between the interbank and open market exchange rate, normalization of travel and US dollar strengthening. On the financing side, inflows are being negatively affected by domestic uncertainty and tightening global financial conditions as major central banks continue to raise policy rates. The financial account recorded net inflow of $1. billion during the first four months of FY23, compared to $5. billion during the same period last year. Looking ahead, higher imports of cotton and lower exports of rice and textiles in the aftermath of the floods should be broadly offset by continued moderation in overall imports due to the economic slowdown and softer global commodity prices. As result, the current account deficit is expected to remain moderate in FY23, with FX reserves gradually improving as anticipated external inflows from bilateral and multilateral sources materialize. If the recent decline in global oil prices intensifies or the pace of rate hikes by major central banks slows, pressures on the external account could diminish further. Fiscal sector. Despite the budgeted consolidation for FY23, fiscal outcomes deteriorated in Q1 relative to the same period last year. The fiscal deficit increased from. to percent of GDP, with the primary surplus declining from. to. percent of GDP. This deterioration was largely due to decline in non-tax revenues and higher interest payments. At the same time, growth in FBR tax revenues more than halved to 16. percent during the first four months of FY23. In response to the floods, the government has implemented number of relief measures for the agriculture sector, including mark-up subsidies for farmers and the provision of subsidized inputs. The floods could make it challenging to achieve the aggressive fiscal consolidation budgeted for this year, but it is important to minimize slippages by meeting additional spending needs largely through expenditure re-allocation and foreign grants, while limiting transfers only to the most vulnerable. Maintaining fiscal discipline is needed to complement monetary tightening, which would together help prevent an entrenchment of inflation and lower external vulnerabilities. Monetary and inflation outlook. In line with the slowdown in economic activity, private sector credit continued to moderate, increasing only by Rs86. billion during Q1 compared to Rs226. billion during the same period last year. This deceleration was mainly due to significant decline in working capital loans to wholesale and retail trade services as well as to the textile sector in the wake of lower domestic cotton output, and slowdown in consumer finance. Headline inflation rose by almost 3½ percentage points in October to 26. percent (y/y), driven by normalization of fuel cost adjustments in electricity tariffs and rising prices of food items. Energy and food prices rose by 35. and 35. percent (y/y), respectively. Meanwhile core inflation increased further to 18. and 14. percent (y/y) in rural and urban areas respectively, as rising food and energy inflation seeped into broader prices, wages and inflation expectations. The momentum of inflation also picked up sharply, rising by. percent (m/m). As result of these developments, inflation projections for FY23 have been revised upwards. While inflation is likely to be more persistent than previously anticipated, it is still expected to fall toward the upper range of the 5-7 percent medium-term target by the end of FY24, supported by prudent macroeconomic policies, orderly Rupee movement, normalizing global commodity prices and beneficial base effects. The MPC will continue to carefully monitor developments affecting medium-term prospects for inflation, financial stability, and growth. Page."
Thailand,2022-11-30,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 6/2022 Mr. Piti Disyatat. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 30 November 2022 as follows. The Committee votes unanimously to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 100 to 125 percent, effective immediately. The Thai economic recovery has continued to gain traction. Tourism and private consumption will continue to be key economic drivers going forward and help alleviate the impact of global slowdown on the Thai economy. Headline inflation is expected to be higher than the previous projection for 2023 due to domestic energy prices. However it is still expected to decline and return to the target range within 2023. The Committee deems that a gradual policy normalization remains an appropriate course for monetary policy given the growth and inflation outlook, and thus votes to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point at this meeting. The Thai economy is projected to continue growing at 32 percent in 2022, 37 percent in 2023, and 39 percent in 2024. The tourism sector continues to strengthen as the number of foreign tourists continues to rise. Additionally private consumption is supported by improving economic activities, as well as a more broad-based recovery in employment and labor income. The trajectory of Thai economic growth remains largely unchanged in 2023 and 2024 as the strength of the tourism sector and private consumption will help lessen the impact of the global slowdown on the Thai export sector. Nonetheless the Committee will monitor the downside risks to the highly uncertain global economic outlook as well as the momentum of the tourism sector. Headline inflation is expected to be at 63 percent in 2022, peaking in the third quarter, before declining to 30 percent in 2023 and 21 percent in 2024. Headline inflation is expected to be higher than previously assessed for 2023 on the back of the upward adjustment of electricity charges, but it is expected to return to the target range by the end of 2023. Core inflation projection is close to the previous assessment at 26 percent in 2022, 25 percent in 2023, and 20 percent in 2024. Meanwhile medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range. However the Committee will continue to closely monitor risks to inflation, especially a potential increase in cost pass-through as well as domestic energy prices which remain uncertain. Overall financial system remains resilient. Commercial banks maintain high levels of capital and loan loss provision. Debt serviceability of households and businesses has improved in line with the economic recovery. However the financial positions of some SMEs 2 and households remain fragile and sensitive to the rising living costs and debt burden as incomes have yet to fully recover. The Committee views that financial institutions should continue to press ahead with debt restructuring and deems it important to have targeted measures and sustainable solutions in place for vulnerable groups. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative. Funding costs in the private sector gradually rise in tandem with the policy rate but remain conducive for business financing, with credit and funding in the bond market still seeing growth. The baht against the US dollar has been highly volatile owing mainly to expectations surrounding the monetary and macroeconomic policy in major economies. The Committee will continue to closely monitor developments in the financial market and volatilities in the foreign exchange market. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee judges that the Thai economic recovery will be on track, albeit with risks to inflation. The policy rate should be normalized to the level that is consistent with sustainable growth in the long term in a gradual and measured manner. Given the heightened uncertainties surrounding the global economy, the Committee is ready to adjust the size and timing of policy normalization should the growth and inflation outlook shift from the current assessment."
Kazakhstan,2022-12-05,"The base rate was raised to 16.75% December 5, 2022 Astana The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to raise the base rate to 16.75% with a band of +/- 1 p.p. The current decision was based on forecasts and analysis of actual data. It was based on external factors in the form of uncertainty of the geopolitical situation and its consequences, as well as continuing high food prices in the world. On the side of the domestic economy there are historically maximum inflationary expectations, imbalance of supply and demand, as well as restructuring of trade with the accelerated growth of imports. The National Bank has approached the completion of the monetary policy tightening cycle. The achieved level of a base rate is assessed as a sufficiently high. Maintaining the base rate at the current values for a long period of time will stabilize inflation and gradually reduce it in the medium term. The probability of further tightening of monetary policy in the absence of new pro-inflationary shocks is assessed as low. Inflation is formed at high levels. In November, the annual inflation rate amounted to 19.6%, demonstrating growth in all components. Monthly inflation slowed somewhat in November, but still remained high, significantly exceeding multi-year averages. This was due to high external inflation with steady domestic demand and the ongoing reorientation of supply chains of consumer goods imports to new trade routes. In this environment, inflationary expectations of households and businesses, which remain near historic highs, and rising consumer lending serve as reinforcing pro- inflationary factors. In an environment of supply chain disruptions, unanchored inflationary expectations stimulate consumption of both nondurable and durable goods. On the external side, the pro-inflationary factors of the external environment are expected to soften in the medium term as a result of suppressed global demand due to the widespread tightening of monetary conditions. An additional factor of gradual reduction of inflationary pressure is a good grain harvest. At the same time, the level of food prices in general will remain high. The ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is a risk factor. Taking into account the above-mentioned factors, the inflation forecast was revised. In the baseline scenario, annual inflation in the current year is projected to be in the range of 20-21%. According to estimates, annual inflation is projected to peak in Q1 2023. As a result of the ongoing structural adjustment of trade with high inflationary expectations and a disinflationary external environment, the inflation forecast for 2023 is raised to 11-13%. In 2024, as a result of growing domestic demand and a slower decline in expectations, inflation is projected to be in the 7-9% range. This inflation trajectory is expected, given that as the inflationary backdrop softens and grain prices remain stable, inflation expectations will decline and consolidate at a historically average level. This will allow inflation to reach the target in the future. In the dynamics of economic growth, despite the overall slowdown, the main sectors of the economy, with the exception of the mining sector, have grown faster this year. The decline in output in the mining sector is due to repairs at the fields, as well as logistics disruptions. GDP growth this year is expected to be in the range of 2-3%, with a further acceleration to 3-4% in 2023. This is due to weaker external demand, more moderate oil production than previously expected, and occasional problems with the delivery of Kazakh exports to world markets. Going forward. GDP growth is projected to stabilize near potential. The main drivers will be growth in exports due to increased oil production, as well as increased investment with moderate demand from households. Fiscal policy will still be in the stimulative zone next year, but the momentum will weaken as a result of the budget rule over the medium term. This will support government consumption and domestic demand. Further economic growth will be constrained by rising imports. Risks to the inflation outlook are associated with uncertainty about the effects of geopolitical tensions and the development of these tensions, the duration of the trade restructuring period, high and volatile inflation expectations, and the persistence of high food inflation. Taking into account the inflation forecast, the National Bank has approached the end of the monetary policy tightening cycle. The achieved level of the base rate is assessed as rather high. Maintaining the base rate at the current values for a long period of time will stabilize inflation and gradually reduce it in the medium term. The probability of further tightening of monetary policy in the absence of new pro-inflationary shocks is assessed as low. The key parameters of the forecast are given in the appendix to the press release. More complete information about the factors of the decision and the forecast will be published in the Report on Monetary Policy on the official website of the National Bank on December 12, 2022. The next scheduled decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on January 13, 2023 at 14:00 Astana time.

Chile,2022-12-06,"NoPtrae sds eR epleraesne s*a Tuesday, 6 December 2022 Monetary Policy Meeting  December 2022 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile agreed to hold the monetary policy interest rate at 11.25%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of its members. Despite the recent downturn in some economies, global inflationary pressures remain high. Central banks in developed economies have continued to raise their benchmark rates and market expectations anticipate that their monetary tightening will be long-lasting. In this scenario, the world growth outlook for 2023 has further adjusted downwards. Global financial markets have reflected an increase in appetite for risk, despite with still high volatility. Accordingly, some of the trends of recent months have been reversed. Most recently, long-term interest rates have fallen, stock markets have risen and the dollar has depreciated around the world. Commodity prices have shown mixed movements. The copper price has approached US$3.8 per pound (+7% since the last Meeting) and that of a barrel of oil is close to US$80 (-9% since the last Meeting for the WTI-Brent average). In general, the domestic financial market has matched the global trends. With respect to the last Meeting, the exchange rate appreciated close to 5% and the IPSA accumulated gains. Meanwhile, nominal long-term interest rates have fallen by around 140 basis points, reflecting a lower risk premium. The domestic credit market remains slow in all its portfolios, as both supply and demand are still weak. The context is one in which lending interest rates continue to be high in nominal terms. The Chilean economy has continued to adjust after the massive increase in spending in 2021. In the third quarter, the de-seasonalized non-mining GDP series fell 0.8% with respect to the previous quarter. In October, the non-mining Imacec followed this trend, decreasing 0.4% monthly in its seasonally adjusted series. On the demand side, gross fixed capital formation surprised on the upside in the third quarter, driven by specific factors, such as investments in renewable energies. Most fundamentals continue to point to weaker investment going forward. Consumption continued to adjust downward, in line with the normalization of liquidity, slow job creation, falling real wages, and consumers' pessimism. In October, headline and core inflation stood at 12.8% and 10.8%, respectively, both down from the previous month. In the October figure, the deceleration of core goods stood out, as they showed negative variation in the month. Two-year inflation expectations continue to exceed the 3% target. Monetary policy has made a significant adjustment and is facilitating the resolution of the imbalances present in the economy. However, inflation remains very high and its convergence to the 3% target is still subject to risks. The Board will maintain the MPR at 11.25% until the state of the macroeconomy indicates that this process has been consolidated. Nota de prensa The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Thursday 22 December 2022. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will be held on Wednesday 25 and Thursday 26 January 2023, and the statement thereof will be released at 18:00 hours of the second day. The Spanish original prevails.

Brazil,2022-12-07,"In its 251st meeting. Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. The following observations provide an update of Copom's scenario:. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; the heightened uncertainty about the country's future fiscal framework and additional fiscal stimuli that support aggregate demand, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset prices; and an output gap tighter than the one currently adopted by the Committee in its reference scenario, especially in the labor market. Among the downside risks, it should be noted an additional reduction in the prices of international commodities measured in local currency; a greater than projected deceleration of global economic activity; and the continuity of tax cuts assumed to be reversed in 2023. The current scenario, particularly uncertain on the fiscal side, requires serenity when evaluating risks. The Committee will closely monitor future developments in fiscal policy and, in particular, its effects on asset prices and inflation expectations, with potential impacts on the dynamics of future inflation. Considering the assessed scenarios, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information. Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and 2024. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing economic fluctuations and fostering full employment. The Committee will remain vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a sufficiently long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets. The Committee reinforces that future monetary policy steps can be adjusted and will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto de Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Diogo Abry Guillen. Fernanda Magalhaes Rumenos Guardado. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza and Renato Dias de Brito Gomes. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
India,2022-12-07,"Monetary Policy Statement, 2022-23 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) December 5-7, 2022 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (December 7, 2022) decided to: Increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 35 basis points to 6.25 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 6.00 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.50 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. The global economic outlook is skewed to the downside. Global growth is set to lose momentum as monetary policy actions tighten financial conditions and as consumer confidence weakens with the rising cost of livelihood. Inflation remains elevated and persistent across countries as they grapple with food and energy price shocks and shortages. More recently, however, there are some signs of moderation in price pressures, which have raised expectations of an easing in the pace of monetary tightening. Alongside easing in sovereign bond yields, the US dollar has come off its highs. Capital flows to emerging market economies (EMEs) remain volatile and global spillovers pose risks to growth prospects. Domestic Economy 3. On the domestic front, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 6.3 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q2:2022-23 after an increase of 13.5 per cent in Q1. On the supply side, gross value added (GVA) rose by 5.6 per cent in Q2.2 4. In Q3, economic activity is exhibiting resilience. In the agricultural sector, a pick-up in rabi sowing (6.4 per cent higher than a year ago on December 2) is supported by the good progress of the north-east monsoon and above average reservoir levels. Activity in the industry and services sectors is in expansion mode, as reflected in purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) and other high frequency indicators. Aggregate demand conditions have been supported by pent-up spending and discretionary expenditures during the festival season, although their evolution is somewhat uneven across sectors. Urban demand has remained buoyant, and rural demand is recovering. Investment activity is in modest expansion. Merchandise exports contracted in October after an expansion for 19 consecutive months. Growth in non-oil non-gold imports decelerated. CPI inflation moderated to 6.8 per cent (y-o-y) in October 2022 from 7.4 per cent in September, with favourable base effects mitigating the impact of pick-up in price momentum in October. Food inflation softened, aided by easing inflation in vegetables and edible oils, despite sustained pressures from prices of cereals, milk and spices. Fuel inflation registered some easing in October, driven by softening of price inflation in LPG, kerosene (PDS) and firewood and chips. Core CPI (i.e. CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation persisted at elevated levels at 6 per cent, with price pressures across most of its constituent sub-groups. The overall liquidity remains in surplus, with average daily absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) at ₹1.4 lakh crore during October-November as compared with ₹2.2 lakh crore in August-September. On a y-o-y basis, money supply (M3) expanded by 8.9 per cent as on November 18, 2022 while bank credit rose by 17.2 per cent. India's foreign exchange reserves were placed at US$ 561.2 billion as on December 2, 2022. Outlook 8. The inflation trajectory going ahead would be shaped by both global and domestic factors. In case of food, while vegetable prices are likely to see seasonal winter correction, prices of cereals and spices may stay elevated in the near-term on supply concerns. High feed costs could also keep inflation elevated in respect of milk. Adverse climate events  both domestic and global  are increasingly becoming a significant source of upside risk to food prices. Global demand is weakening. Unabating geopolitical tensions continue to impart uncertainty to the food and energy prices outlook. The correction in industrial input prices and supply chain pressures, if sustained, could help ease pressures on output prices; but the pending pass-through of input costs could keep core inflation firm. Imported inflation risks from the US dollar movements need to be watched closely. Taking into account these factors and assuming an average crude oil price (Indian basket) of US$ 100 per barrel, inflation is projected at 6.7 per cent in 2022-23, with Q3 at 6.6 per cent and Q4 at 5.9 per cent, and risks evenly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2023-24 is projected at 5.0 per cent and for Q2 at 5.4 per cent, on the assumption of a normal monsoon (Chart 1). On growth, the agricultural outlook has brightened, with the prospects of a good rabi harvest. The sustained rebound in contact-intensive sectors is supporting urban consumption. Robust and broad-based credit growth and government's thrust on capital spending and infrastructure should bolster investment activity. According to the RBI's survey, consumer confidence is improving. The economy, however, faces accentuated headwinds from protracted geopolitical tensions, tightening global financial conditions and slowing external demand. Taking all these factors into3 consideration, the real GDP growth for 2022-23 is projected at 6.8 per cent with Q3 at 4.4 per cent and Q4 at 4.2 per cent, with risks evenly balanced. Real GDP growth is projected at 7.1 per cent for Q1:2023-24 and at 5.9 per cent for Q2 (Chart 2). Inflation has ruled at or above the upper tolerance band since January 2022 and core inflation is persisting around 6 per cent. Headline inflation is expected to remain above or close to the upper threshold in Q3 and Q4:2022-23. It is likely to moderate in H1:2023-24 but will still remain well above the target. Meanwhile, economic activity has held up well and is expected to be resilient, supported by domestic demand. Net exports would remain subdued due to the drag from evolving external demand conditions. Further, the impact of monetary policy measures undertaken needs to be watched. On balance, the MPC is of the view that, further calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to keep inflation expectations anchored, break the core inflation persistence and contain second round effects, so as to strengthen medium-term growth prospects. Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 35 basis points to 6.25 per cent. Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Dr.Rajiv Ranjan. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to increase the policy repo rate by 35 basis points. Jayanth R. Varma voted against the repo rate hike. Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Rajiv Ranjan. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted against this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published on December 21, 2022. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during February 6-8, 2023. (Yogesh Dayal) Press Release: 2022-2023/1320 Chief General Manager."
Peru,2022-12-07,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT DECEMBER 2022 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 7.50% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 25 bps to 7.50 percent, thus continuing to adjust its monetary policy stance. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation increased from 8.28 percent in October to 8.45 percent in November, while core inflation decreased from 5.72 percent in October to 5.71 percent in November, both above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The significant increase in international food and fuel prices since the second half of last year, accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in global inflation in magnitudes not seen in many years and towards levels significantly higher than the inflation targets of central banks, both in advanced and other economies in the region. A downward trend in year-on-year inflation is forecast, with a return to the target range in the fourth quarter of next year, due to a moderation of the impact of international food and fuel prices, and to a reduction in inflation expectations. One-year-ahead expected inflation decreased from 4.78 percent in October to 4.68 percent in November; and inflation in 2023 is expected at 4.40 percent, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most leading and expectations indicators for economic activity remain in pessimistic territory. The outlook for global economic activity has deteriorated due to monetary tightening in advanced economies, the impact of inflation on consumption, lower growth in China, and international conflicts. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants, including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, to consider changes in the monetary stance. The Board reaffirms its commitment to adopt necessary actions to ensure the return of inflation to the target range over the forecast horizon. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 5.25 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 8.00 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months and the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months. In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates based on the amount of the operations. The schedule of monetary policy meetings for the next twelve months is the following: January 12 February 9 March 9 April 13 May 11 June 8 July 13 August 10 September 14 October 5 November 9 December 14."
Poland,2022-12-07,"Warsaw, 7 December 2022 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 7 December 2022 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ▪ reference rate at 6.75%; ▪ lombard rate at 7.25%; ▪ deposit rate at 6.25%; ▪ rediscount rate at 6.80%; ▪ discount rate at 6.85%. Incoming data indicate that growth of economic activity in major economies slows down. In the euro area  after a decline in GDP growth in 2020 Q3  business condition indicators signal further weakening of activity at the beginning of Q4. Despite still favourable labour market situation in the largest economies, activity in the global economy and its prospects continue to be negatively affected primarily by the impact of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine, including high prices of commodities, as well as by the tightening of monetary policy around the world. Meanwhile, there persists uncertainty regarding further impact of these shocks on economic conditions, and in particular in the European economy. Inflation in many economies remains at the highest levels in decades, which  apart from still high commodity prices and protracted effects of strong disruptions in global supply chains  is also driven by demand factors and increasing labour costs. Under such conditions, core inflation in most countries likewise remains high. Recently, however, certain economies have recorded some decline in inflation. At the same time, against a recent fall in prices of some commodities in the international markets and a gradual easing of the supply chain disruptions, there are signs of global price pressures diminishing, especially as in many economies growth in producer prices declined. Many central banks have continued to tighten their monetary policy. In turn, in the Central-Eastern Europe region some central banks  after earlier significant interest rate increases  in recent period have kept interest rates unchanged. In Poland. GDP growth in 2022 Q3  according to Statistics Poland preliminary data  slowed down to 3.6% y/y, compared to 5.8% in Q2. The slowdown resulted from a strong 1/3 decline in the growth of consumption and investment. The opposite effect stemmed from a higher contribution of net exports and the increase in inventories to GDP growth. Monthly data, including data on industrial production, construction and assembly output and retail sales in October, as well as business condition indices for November, signal a further slowdown of GDP growth, whereas the economic outlook is subject to significant uncertainty. Despite the decelerating GDP growth, labour market situation remains good, which is reflected i.a. in a low unemployment rate. At the same time, however. LFS data for 2022 Q3 indicate a fall in the Polish LFS total employment. Inflation in Poland  according to Statistics Poland flash estimate  decreased in November 2022 to 17.4% y/y. The decrease in CPI in year-on-year terms compared to October was driven by lower growth in prices of energy carriers and fuels. Inflation remains at a high level, which  to a great extent  stems from a gradual pass-through of high commodity prices to consumer prices. High commodity prices have been reflected in rising food and energy prices, and, at the same time, they have boosted operating costs of enterprises, which  given the still relatively strong demand  inclined firms to raise prices of goods, contributing to higher core inflation. Core inflation has been also driven by the persisting effects of the disruptions to global supply chains, although they are gradually easing. In turn, the Anti-inflationary Shield continued to limit CPI inflation. The Council assessed, that the expected weakening of the external economic conditions, together with monetary policy tightening by major central banks, will curb global inflation and commodity prices. The weakening of the global economic conditions will also hamper GDP growth in Poland. Under such circumstances, the hitherto significant monetary policy tightening by NBP will support a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target. At the same time, given strength and persistence of the current shocks that remain beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, in the short term inflation will remain high, and its return to the NBP inflation target will be gradual. A decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council's assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy. Further decisions of the Council will depend on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy. NBP will take all necessary actions in order to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability, including above all to reduce the risk of inflation remaining elevated. NBP may 2/3 intervene in the foreign exchange market, in particular to limit fluctuations of the zloty exchange rate that are inconsistent with the direction of monetary policy."
Ukraine,2022-12-08,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 25% per annum and to raise reserve requirements for banks. This will enhance monetary transmission, support exchange rate stability, and gradually slow inflation in 2023. Inflation continues to grow, but the growth is somewhat slower than forecast by the NBU. The rise in consumer prices in Ukraine accelerated to 26.6% yoy as of end-October. According to the NBU's preliminary estimates, inflation continued to increase in November, albeit slower than envisaged in the October forecast (October 2022 Inflation Report). The rise in inflation continues to be driven mainly by consequences of hostilities and occupation of some regions of Ukraine, which primarily pushes up production costs and causes shortages of some products. A surge of russia's terrorist attacks against Ukraine's critical infrastructure, particularly targeting power supply facilities, is affecting economic activity in various sectors  from metals industry to food industry, animal farming, and the services sector. In particular, businesses' expenses on maintaining uninterrupted operations amid regular power outages have grown considerably over past several months. In addition, the shortage of electric power causes production cuts, leading to a decrease in supply of goods. Households' higher demand for fuel on the back of regular power outages creates additional pressure on energy prices. All the above factors are driving an increase in prices for a wide range of goods and services, with prices for some items surging. Nevertheless, the overall dynamics of inflation remain under control and are even slightly below the trajectory of the macroeconomic forecast the NBU made in October. The gradual tightening of monetary conditions following the key policy rate hike to 25% in June and fixing the official hryvnia exchange rate are playing a major role in stabilizing inflation expectations. Thanks to FX market regulation and the introduction of new savings protection instruments, the spread between the hryvnia exchange rate on the cash market and the official exchange rate narrowed markedly. Coupled with strict adherence by the NBU and the government to their joint plan to reduce monetary financing of the budget deficit, this eased pressures on the FX market and resulted in a decrease in net FX sales by the NBU. In addition, large inflows of financial assistance drove an increase in international reserves, strengthening the NBU's capability to maintain exchange rate stability. Unchanged utility tariffs also remain important for restraining inflation. Moreover, in November, increased supply put the brakes on the growth in prices for some food products that had been growing rapidly in previous months. The cycle of annual inflation deceleration is expected to start in Q2 2023. After this year's inflation surge caused by the full-scale war, the growth in consumer prices will slow as of the end of next year. This should be primarily driven by security risks subsiding thanks to the success of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Liberation of occupied territories, setting up production and logistics, and increased capability of maritime logistics will play an important role in curbing inflation processes. Well-coordinated fiscal and monetary policies will remain essential for steady disinflation next year. In particular, monetary financing of the budget is expected to cease from the start of 2023. The optimization of budget expenditures, international support, and a recovery in domestic debt market will enable the government to secure planned revenues and finance all critical expenditures. At the same time, the NBU keeping monetary conditions relatively tight will help increase the attractiveness of hryvnia assets and prevent the development of an inflation and depreciation spiral. This year's low base and a gradual decline in global energy prices will also contribute to slower inflation. However, as before, the NBU does not expect rapid disinflation during the war. The Ukrainian economy will continue facing limited logistics and electricity shortages in the long run. Weaker consumer demand can only partially offset the inflationary effect from higher production costs. Therefore, inflation will decelerate slowly and will significantly exceed the NBU's 5% target in 20232024. Under such conditions, the NBU will focus on maintaining control of inflation expectations and reining in inflation processes. Sufficient and regular inflows of international financing and cooperation with the IMF remain an important precondition for the stable functioning of the economy in wartime. In H2 2022, international partners considerably increased their financial assistance to Ukraine, which played an important role in maintaining macrofinancial stability. International assistance is expected to exceed USD 31 billion as of the end of this year. International financial assistance needed to finance the budget deficit and restore the economy will continue to arrive into 2023. More specifically, the European Union and the Unites States have already announced their preliminary intentions to provide Ukraine with EUR 18 billion and about USD 10 billion respectively. As in 2022, a considerable portion of these funds is expected to be given as grants, which will not push up Ukraine's debt burden in the post-war period. What is more. Ukraine has made some progress in negotiating with the IMF a new monitoring program involving the IMF Executive Board. Once finalized, this program will help Ukraine obtain financing from other international donors in 2023. The NBU expects that an Extended Fund Facility will be approved for Ukraine after the monitoring program expires. Ukraine is also negotiating over obtaining financing from other partner countries and international financial organizations. An extended full-scale war by russia and escalating terrorist attacks on the country's critical infrastructure are the key risks for Ukraine's economic development. Risks for the economy remain elevated. On the one hand, the threat that the ""grain corridor"" will cease operating and risks that Ukraine will not obtain enough external financing have declined. The reduction in the risks resulted, among other things, from Ukraine's international partners reiterating their commitments, and from successful talks with the IMF. The smaller extent of the NBU's interventions to sell FX and larger international reserves than expected in October have decreased risks to exchange rate stability and control over price growth. On the other hand, russia has scaled up its terrorist attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The risk of continued terrorist attacks on Ukraine's critical infrastructure persists. The NBU's October macroeconomic forecast contained assumptions that power transmitting and generating facilities will be temporarily unavailable in winter. However, the scale and duration of blackouts could be greater than expected. This could dampen economic activity and increase inflationary pressures. Other risks also remain relevant. If realized, these risks will worsen inflation dynamics and hold back economic recovery. despite a certain easing, the risk of state finances becoming unbalanced persists on the back of the unpredictable nature of the war and the emergence of additional budgetary needs. Taking into account high energy prices, a separate problem could arise from the formation of large quasi-fiscal deficits in the energy sector.the duration and intensity of hostilities, together with energy terror attacks, are increasing the risk that a large part of the Ukrainians who have gone abroad will not return, and that some more Ukrainians may decide to leave Ukraine, at least during the heating season. In the short term, this will depress consumer demand, while in the longer term, it threatens to create a demographic crisis and to aggravate structural problems on the labor market.In view of the expected price movements, persistently high inflation expectations and the upward shift of the balance of risks, the NBU Board decided to keep the key policy rate at 25%, while also tightening reserve requirements for banks in order to strengthen monetary transmission. The banking system's liquidity surplus hit a record high in late 2022, slowing the monetary transmission from the June hike in the key policy rate. In particular, the rise in interest rates on hryvnia deposits did not meet expectations, considering an enduring large spread between the cost of the banks' liabilities and their return on assets. Given heightened inflation and exchange rate expectations, the lack of attractive instruments for household hryvnia deposits is making the financial system more sensitive to situational factors. This is posing risks to macrofinancial stability, requiring the NBU to take additional steps to sterilize the surfeit of the supply of hryvnias. In view of the above, the NBU has increased the required reserve ratios for hryvnia and FX current accounts by 5 pp. At the same time, the NBU will allow the banks to use benchmark domestic government debt securities to meet up to 50% of their total required reserve ratios. The NBU will decide separately on a list of securities eligible for meeting the required reserve ratios, on the basis of proposals made by the Finance Ministry. The banks must start complying with new reserve requirements from 11 January 2023, using domestic government debt securities to meet a portion of their required reserve ratios if they chose to do so. This mechanism will encourage the banks to expand their portfolios of domestic government bonds, lowering the risk of returning to the monetary financing of the budget deficit in 2023. After assessing the effectiveness of the above measures and changes in the banking system's liquidity, the NBU will decide whether or not it should increase the required reserve ratios any further. If pro-inflationary risks materialize, the NBU stands ready to tighten monetary conditions in order to keep the exchange rate and inflation in check. Among other things, the NBU will evaluate the results of the measures taken and their impact on the FX and domestic debt market. The central bank will also consider the prospects of Ukraine's receiving sufficient amounts of international financial aid in good time, price and inflation expectations dynamics, and produce a revised macroeconomic forecast, which will be presented in late January 2023. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 25% per annum was approved by an NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No. 576, dated 8 December 2022. A summary of the discussion between the members of the Monetary Policy Committee that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 19 December 2022. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 26 January 2023, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
Armenia,2022-12-13,"PRESS RELEASE 13.12.2022 Refinancing Rate Set at 10.75% At the December 13, 2022 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) decided to raise the refinancing rate by 0.25 pp to 10.75%. In November 2022, the 12-month inflation decreased to 8.8%. The 12-month core inflation reduced as well, reaching 9.9%. Global economic activity continue slowing. However, the inflationary environment in Armenia's main partner countries still persists driven by expanded demand and high inflation expectations. Therefore, the central banks of developed countries will continue to tighten monetary conditions in the near future. Consistent tightening of monetary conditions in partner countries will contribute to the weakening of global demand and some downward price adjustment in international commodity markets. Subsequently, the inflationary effects on the Armenian economy from the external sector are expected to weaken. In the fourth quarter of 2022, high activity in the Armenian economy persists. Elevated external demand continues to contribute the higher growth in the services sector. At the same time, an increase in export and GDP potential is observable in the services and industry sectors. The growth of prices of imported food products is somewhat slowing down as a result of the contractionary monetary policy, the dram appreciation, as well as the effects spilled over from the external environment. This helps to mitigate the overall inflationary environment. Nevertheless, the impact of sustained high demand and high inflation expectations still plays a significant role in the behavior of inflation. The Board of the CBA finds it reasonable to raise the policy rate. The Board of the CBA will be committed to taking adequate actions to stabilize inflation and offset any risk of deanchoring inflation expectations. According to the outlined monetary policy scenario, the 12-month inflation will gradually decline and stabilize around the 4% target in the medium run. The Board of the CBA estimates that the risks of inflation deviation from the projected path are mainly balanced; should the risks materialize in any direction, the Board stands ready to respond accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective. Detailed information on the basis for determining the interest rate can be found in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program. Q4, 2022) to be published by December 27, 2022."
Philippines,2022-12-14,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to raise the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility by 50 basis points to 5.5 percent, effective tomorrow, 16 December 2022. Accordingly, the interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities will be set to 5.0 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively. The BSP's latest baseline forecasts show that average inflation is still projected to breach the upper end of the 2-4 percent target range for 2022 and 2023 at 5.8 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively. However, the forecast for 2024 fell to 2.8 percent owing mainly to the further easing in oil prices, peso appreciation, and the slightly lower domestic growth outlook resulting in part from the BSP's cumulative policy rate adjustments. The Monetary Board arrived at its decision after noting the further uptick in headline and the sharp rise in core inflation in November amid pent-up demand. Moreover, upside risks continue to dominate the inflation outlook up to 2023 while remaining broadly balanced in 2024. The expected upside risks to inflation over the policy horizon stem mainly from elevated international food prices due to high fertilizer prices and supply chain constraints. On the domestic front, trade restrictions, increased prices of fruits and vegetables due to weather disturbances, higher sugar prices, pending petitions for transport fare hikes, as well as potential wage adjustments in 2023 could push inflation upwards. Meanwhile, the impact of a weaker-than-expected global economic recovery continues to be the primary downside risk to the outlook. Amid broad-based inflation pressures, persistent upside risks to inflation, and elevated inflation expectations, the Monetary Board deems it necessary to take aggressive monetary action to bring headline inflation back to within target as soon as possible. At the same time, an adjustment in the policy interest rate will continue to provide a cushion against external spillovers amid tighter global financial conditions. The BSP remains steadfast in its commitment to its primary mandate of sustaining price and financial stability and stands ready to take all necessary action to bring inflation to within the 2-4 percent government target band over the medium term."
United States,2022-12-14,"EST December 14, 2022 Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Russia's war against Ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are contributing to upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. (more)In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C Williams. Vice Chair; Michael S Barr; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Susan M. Collins; Lisa D Cook; Esther L George; Philip N Jefferson; Loretta J Mester; and Christopher J Waller. -0- For media inquiries, please email media@frb.gov or call 202-452-2955."
Euroarea,2022-12-15,"Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. The Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and, based on the substantial upward revision to the inflation outlook, we expect to raise them further. In particular, we judge that interest rates will still have to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levels that are sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and will also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach. The key ECB interest rates are our primary tool for setting the monetary policy stance. The Governing Council today also discussed principles for normalising the Eurosystem's monetary policy securities holdings. From the beginning of March 2023 onwards, the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of the second quarter of 2023 and its subsequent pace will be determined over time. At its February meeting the Governing Council will announce the detailed parameters for reducing the APP holdings. The Governing Council will regularly reassess the pace of the APP portfolio reduction to ensure it remains consistent with the overall monetary policy strategy and stance, to preserve market functioning, and to maintain firm control over short-term money market conditions. By the end of 2023, we will also review our operational framework for steering short-term interest rates, which will provide information regarding the endpoint of the balance sheet normalisation process. We decided to raise interest rates today, and expect to raise them significantly further, because inflation remains far too high and is projected to stay above our target for too long. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, inflation was 10.0 per cent in November, slightly lower than the 10.6 per cent recorded in October. The decline resulted mainly from lower energy price inflation. Food price inflation and underlying price pressures across the economy have strengthened and will persist for some time. Amid exceptional uncertainty. Eurosystem staff have significantly revised up their inflation projections. They now see average inflation reaching 8.4 per cent in 2022 before decreasing to 6.3 per cent in 2023, with inflation expected to decline markedly over the course of the year. Inflation is then projected to average 3.4 per cent in 2024 and 2.3 per cent in 2025. Inflation excluding energy and food is projected to be 3.9 per cent on average in 2022 and to rise to 4.2 per cent in 2023, before falling to 2.8 per cent in 2024 and 2.4 per cent in 2025. The euro area economy may contract in the current quarter and the next quarter, owing to the energy crisis, high uncertainty, weakening global economic activity and tighter financing conditions. According to the latest Eurosystem staff projections, a recession would be relatively short-lived and shallow. Growth is nonetheless expected to be subdued next year and has been revised down significantly compared with the previous projections. Beyond the near term, growth is projected to recover as the current headwinds fade. Overall, the Eurosystem staff projections now see the economy growing by 3.4 per cent in 2022, 0.5 per cent in 2023, 1.9 per cent in 2024 and 1.8 per cent in 2025. The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website. I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. Economic growth in the euro area slowed to 0.3 per cent in the third quarter of the year. High inflation and tighter financing conditions are dampening spending and production by reducing real household incomes and pushing up costs for firms. The world economy is also slowing, in a context of continued geopolitical uncertainty, especially owing to Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine and its people, and tighter financing conditions worldwide. The past deterioration in the terms of trade, reflecting the faster rise in import prices than in export prices, continues to weigh on purchasing power in the euro area. On the positive side, employment increased by 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, and unemployment hit a new historical low of 6.5 per cent in October. Rising wages are set to restore some lost purchasing power, supporting consumption. As the economy weakens, however, job creation is likely to slow, and unemployment could rise over the coming quarters. Fiscal support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should be temporary, targeted and tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy. Fiscal measures falling short of these principles are likely to exacerbate inflationary pressures, which would necessitate a stronger monetary policy response. Moreover, in line with the EU's economic governance framework, fiscal policies should be oriented towards making our economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area's supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, can help reduce price pressures in the medium term. To that end, governments should swiftly implement their investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme. The reform of the EU's economic governance framework should be concluded rapidly. Inflation declined to 10.0 per cent in November, mainly on the back of lower energy price inflation, while services inflation also edged down. Food price inflation rose further to 13.6 per cent, however, as high input costs in food production were passed through to consumer prices. Price pressures remain strong across sectors, partly as a result of the impact of high energy costs throughout the economy. Inflation excluding energy and food was unchanged in November, at 5.0 per cent, and other measures of underlying inflation are also high. Fiscal measures to compensate households for high energy prices and inflation are set to dampen inflation over next year but will raise it once they are withdrawn. Supply bottlenecks are gradually easing, although their effects are still contributing to inflation, pushing up goods prices in particular. The same holds true for the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions: while weakening, the effect of pent-up demand is still driving up prices, especially in the services sector. The depreciation of the euro this year is also continuing to feed through to consumer prices. Wage growth is strengthening, supported by robust labour markets and some catch-up in wages to compensate workers for high inflation. As these factors are set to remain in place, the Eurosystem staff projections see wages growing at rates well above historical averages and pushing up inflation throughout the projection period. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent, although further above-target revisions to some indicators warrant continued monitoring. Risks to the economic growth outlook are on the downside, especially in the near term. The war against Ukraine remains a significant downside risk to the economy. Energy and food costs could also remain persistently higher than expected. There could be an additional drag on growth in the euro area if the world economy were to weaken more sharply than we expect. The risks to the inflation outlook are primarily on the upside. In the near term, existing pipeline pressures could lead to stronger than expected rises in retail prices for energy and food. Over the medium term, risks stem primarily from domestic factors such as a persistent rise in inflation expectations above our target or higher than anticipated wage rises. By contrast, a decline in energy costs or a further weakening of demand would lower price pressures. As we tighten monetary policy, borrowing is becoming more expensive for firms and households. Bank lending to firms remains robust, as firms replace bonds with bank loans and use credit to finance the higher costs of production and investment. Households are borrowing less, because of tighter credit standards, rising interest rates, worsening prospects for the housing market and lower consumer confidence. In line with our monetary policy strategy, twice a year the Governing Council assesses in depth the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability. The financial stability environment has deteriorated since our last review in June 2022 owing to a weaker economy and rising credit risk. In addition, sovereign vulnerabilities have risen amid the weaker economic outlook and weaker fiscal positions. Tighter financing conditions would mitigate the build-up of financial vulnerabilities and lower tail risks to inflation over the medium term, at the cost of a higher risk of systemic stress and greater downside risks to growth in the short term. In addition, the liquidity needs of non-bank financial institutions may amplify market volatility. At the same time, euro area banks have comfortable levels of capital, which helps to reduce the side effects of tighter monetary policy on financial stability. Macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence in preserving financial stability and addressing medium-term vulnerabilities. Summing up, we have today raised the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and, based on the substantial upward revision to our inflation outlook, we expect to raise them further. In particular, we judge that interest rates will still have to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levels that are sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and will also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. Moreover, from the beginning of March 2023 onwards, the APP portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and determined meeting by meeting. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term inflation target."
Mexico,2022-12-15,"World economic activity recovered slightly during the third quarter, although the outlook for 2023 continued deteriorating. Global inflation remains high, while in some economies headline inflation decreased in response to lower pressures on food and energy prices. A large number of central banks continued raising their reference rates. Some of them mentioned that they would start moderating their pace of adjustment. These reference rates, however, are foreseen to remain at high levels for an extended period. In its latest monetary policy decision, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points, after having increased it by 75 basis points four consecutive times. It also anticipated additional increases. Among key global risks are those associated with the pandemic, the persistence of inflationary pressures, the intensification of geopolitical turmoil, and tighter monetary and financial conditions. The Mexican peso continued showing resilience, although with some volatility. Short-term interest rates increased while medium- and long-term ones decreased significantly. The Mexican economy is anticipated to have continued recovering during the fourth quarter, although at a slower pace. Slack conditions are thus expected to continue diminishing. In November, headline inflation continued decreasing to a level of 7.80%, due to a reduction in its non- core component. Core inflation, on the contrary, continued trending upwards, reaching 8.51%. Both headline and core inflation were at levels below those of analysts' expectations. Expectations for headline inflation for 2022 and 2023 were revised downwards, while those for core inflation were again adjusted slightly upwards. Those for the medium and long terms remained stable, although above target. Forecasts for headline inflation were revised downwards for the first two quarters, and then marginally upwards until the fourth quarter of 2023, due to a slight increase in the trajectory for core inflation. Inflation is still projected to converge to the 3% target in the third quarter of 2024 (see Table). These projections are subject to risks. On the upside: persistence of core inflation at high levels; external inflationary pressures associated with the pandemic; pressures on agricultural and livestock product prices and on energy prices due to the ongoing geopolitical conflict; exchange rate depreciation; and greater cost-related pressures. On the downside: a greater-than-anticipated slowdown of the world economy; a decline in the intensity of the geopolitical conflict; a better functioning of supply chains; a lower pass-through effect from some cost-related pressures; and a larger-than-anticipated effect from the Federal Government's measures to fight elevated prices. Although some shocks show signs of subsiding, the balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon remains biased to the upside. 1 The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and its determinants, along with the evolution of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process. It considered the challenges for monetary policy stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of uncertainty, the inflationary pressures accumulated as a result of the pandemic and the geopolitical conflict, the possibility of greater effects on inflation, and the monetary policy stance already attained in this hiking cycle. Based on these considerations, the Board decided by majority to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 percentage points to 10.50%. With this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon. The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations. This, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times, with both the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets. The Board considers it will still be necessary to raise the reference rate in its next monetary policy meeting. Subsequently, it will assess if the reference rate needs to be further adjusted as well as the pace of adjustments based on the prevailing conditions. Voting in favor of the decision were Victoria Rodríguez. Galia Borja. Irene Espinosa, and Jonathan Heath. Gerardo Esquivel voted in favor of raising the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 10.25%. 2/ Forecast starting November 2022.

Colombia,2022-12-16,"Four directors voted in favor of this decision. One director voted for an increase of 125 bp, and another voted for an increase of 25 bp. In their policy discussion, the Board of Directors took the following factors into account. In November, annual inflation remained on an upward trend that was higher than expected. Total inflation stood at 12.5% and core inflation (excluding (food and regulated items) had reached 8.8%. The accumulated exchange rate pressure on prices and indexation to high inflation rates contributed to this result. Annual GDP growth in the third quarter reached 7.1% and exceeded the technical staff's forecast (6.4%). In spite of the fact that economic activity has slowed down in recent months, 8.0% growth is forecast for the full year. Inflation expectations remain above target at all horizons. In the case of the expectations survey done by Banco de la Republica in December, total inflation will probably be 7.5% and non-food inflation is expected to be 7.0% by the end of 2023. Banco de la Republica. The current account deficit as a share of GDP in the third quarter of 2022 reached a historically high level of 7.2%. Although the international financial conditions for Colombia have improved recently, they remain tight at the global level in a context in which the world economy is expected to slow down. With the decision adopted at today's meeting, the Board of Directors is continuing the process of adjusting monetary policy to bring inflation back to its 3% target in the medium term with sustainable economic growth. To this end, they will adopt the decisions they deem necessary based on the new information available. Fecha de publicacion."
Mongolia,2022-12-16,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Increasing the policy rate No: 2022/05 Date: December 16, 2022 The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Mongolia (MPC) held its scheduled meetings on December 15 and 16, 2022. Taking into consideration the current state of the economy and financial markets as well as the outlook and risks to the domestic and external economic environment, the MPC decided to raise the policy rate by 1 percentage point to 13 percent by majority vote. Annual inflation reached 14.5 percent nationwide as of November 2022. The inflation has been declining in line with the projection in recent months. In the coming quarters, the effects of the increase in global inflation, food, and fuel prices will grow more than previously expected, and government budget expenditures and wages will likely increase higher than expected. Economic activity was relatively stronger than expected in the third quarter of 2022, surpassing the pre- COVID-19 levels. In recent months, the mining and transportation sectors have recovered, and the construction sector has grown due to railway construction. Non-mining sectors such as trade, services, and net product taxes have continued to intensify in the third quarter of 2022. The labor market has returned to its pre-pandemic levels, and household consumption has been steadily increasing for the past 4 consecutive quarters. All of which have supported economic growth. Furthermore, the economic outlook will depend mainly on China's “Zero-Covid” policy, the situation at border ports, the deficit in the balance of payments, and the actual export earnings. Global economic growth has decelerated, prices of main export commodities have fallen, and the outlook for the external environment has worsened. In the following year, along with the deterioration of the external environment, the substantial expansion of government budget expenditures will stimulate import demand and aggravate the internal and external balance. In addition, the growth of consumer loans is expected to escalate following the wage growth, which will heighten both the household debt burden and imports. In consequence, the MPC has raised the policy rate to stabilize the medium-term inflation expectations and increase the domestic currency yield. This policy measure is consistent with the commitment to reducing inflation to the target level and ensuring the economy's internal and external balance. The subsequent policy actions on whether to pursue further monetary tightening would depend on developments in the external and domestic economy and outlook changes in inflation and macroeconomic conditions. The MPC remains committed to implementing necessary policy actions until inflation returns to stabilizing around the target level. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Russia,2022-12-16,"On 16 December 2022, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 7.50% per annum. Current consumer prices are growing at a moderate rate, and consumer demand is subdued. Inflation expectations of households and businesses, essentially unchanged, remain elevated. At the same time, pro-inflation risks are up and prevail over disinflationary risks. This comes as a result of rising inflation pressures from the labour market, worsening foreign trade conditions and a softer fiscal stance. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will decline to 5.07.0% in 2023 to return to 4% in 2024. Inflation movements. In November, the annual growth rate of consumer prices was 12.0% (vs 12.6% in October). According to 12 December data, annual inflation is up to 12.7%, which takes into account the earlier indexation of utility rates (formerly planned for July 2023). Annual inflation has significantly declined since it peaked in the spring. It still mainly reflects the effects of the sharp surge in prices that occurred between February and April 2022. At present, inflationary pressures are overall moderate. However, the current rate of price growth is up slightly, in part due to steady components of inflation. Despite the relatively low price growth rates in the previous months, inflation expectations of households and price expectations of businesses are high. Concurrently, price expectations of businesses have shown some growth since late summer. Analysts' medium-term inflation expectations are anchored close to 4%. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will decline to 5.07.0% in 2023, return to 4% in 2024 and stabilise close to 4% further on. Monetary conditions have remained overall neutral. OFZ yields are essentially unchanged since the end of October. Deposit and loan rates have been gradually adjusting to the September upward movement in the OFZ curve. At the same time, credit activity has remained high, especially in the corporate sector. Flash estimates indicate a recovery in retail lending following a temporary slowdown in October, in large measure on the back of stabilisation in consumer sentiment. In the context of growing deposit rates since late September, credit institutions have recorded a resumed inflow of household funds, although chiefly to current accounts. Despite increased inflation expectations, consumer behaviour is overall cautious. This is reflected in the high propensity to save and the increased share of liquid assets (current accounts and ruble cash) in the savings structure. Economic activity. The external environment for the Russian economy remains challenging and significantly constrains economic activity. This relates in particular to the logistics problems that still exist in many industries. However, high-frequency indicators suggest some growth in business activity in the fourth quarter. At present, the capacity to expand production in the Russian economy is largely limited by the labour market conditions. Unemployment has dropped to a record low. Labour shortages are increasing in many industries amid the effects of the partial mobilisation. Under these conditions, real wage growth is accelerating in these sectors and could outpace productivity growth. During the transformation of the economy, a change in the structure of aggregate demand is taking place. Consumer demand remains subdued. Investment demand in the private sector is slowing down amid growing government investment. Overall, the contribution of fiscal policy to the dynamics of domestic demand is increasing. The additional fiscal easing announced by the Government will support economic activity in 2023. Inflation risks. The medium-term balance of risks remains tilted towards pro-inflation risks. Short-term pro-inflation risks have increased and also prevail over disinflationary risks. A slowdown in the global economy could weaken foreign demand for Russian exports and have a pro-inflation effect via a weaker ruble. In turn, a further escalation of external trade and financial restrictions, fragmentation of the global economy and the financial system could lead to a sharper decline in the Russian economy's potential than expected in the baseline scenario, which is also a significant pro-inflation risk. Specifically, supply-side constraints may increase due to problems with the supply of equipment, slowly replenishing stocks of finished products, raw materials and components in the event of an escalation of negative trends in imports. As for domestic conditions, pro-inflation effects may be more pronounced than in the baseline scenario due to a reduction in the labour force and a change in the employment structure. Another source of pro-inflation risk could be accelerated growth in real wages that exceeds productivity growth. High and unanchored inflation expectations, which are particularly sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations, are also a source of risk. Under these conditions, the growth of the most liquid assets in the structure of household savings may spur increased consumer demand in the future. A significant disinflationary risk for the baseline scenario is the continued high propensity of households to save amid increased general uncertainty, as well as households' protracted adaptation to a new supply structure in consumer markets. A growing risk premium in bond yields and lending rates could additionally tighten monetary conditions, which could restrain lending in the economy. A more rapid adaptation of the economy, accompanied by an active recovery of imports among other things may also have a disinflationary effect. In the coming months, the disinflationary effects of increased supply in certain food markets may also become more pronounced. The movements of the economy and inflation largely depend on fiscal policy decisions. The Bank of Russia takes into account the decisions already made regarding the mid-term expenditure path of the federal budget and the fiscal system as a whole. In case of a further budget deficit expansion, tighter monetary policy may be required to return inflation to target in 2024 and keep it close to 4% further on. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 10 February 2023. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the medium-term forecast are to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. Statement by Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina in follow-up to Board of Directors meeting on 16 December 2022.

Hungary,2022-12-20,"At its meeting on 20 December 2022, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 21 December 2022:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. Over the past quarter, global economic growth has slowed, and GDP has already declined in several countries. Looking ahead, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war, the energy crisis in Europe and the generally rising interest rate environment continue to present significant uncertainty. Commodity and energy prices have fallen significantly in the past months but remain high relative to previous years. Global inflation started to moderate slowly in an increasing number of countries. The slowdown in the global economy, weakening demand, falling global energy and commodity prices, as well as lower international freight costs and the easing of difficulties in production chains, point to a continued deceleration in global price increases from 2023. Investor sentiment has been mixed since the previous interest rate decision. Monetary policy decisions by the world's leading central banks and developments in the economic outlook were the main factors influencing risk appetite. Developments in the Russia-Ukraine war continue to create significant uncertainties in the CEE region. The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank raised interest rates by 50 basis points in December, to a smaller extent than previously. In addition, the ECB announced that it would start reducing the portfolio built under its asset purchase programme from March 2023. In the CEE region, the Polish central bank left interest rate conditions unchanged. Hungarian economic growth slowed in the third quarter of 2022. In October, industrial production increased on an annual basis, while construction output declined. Retail sales have been growing at a declining pace since March, while sales excluding fuels have already been decreasing. The labour market continues to be tight, and the unemployment rate is low. Overall, annual growth in 2022 has been more favourable than earlier expected, while the high-frequency data point to a further slowdown in GDP growth towards the end of the year. Growth next year is likely to be slowed by both domestic and external demand factors. The decline in real incomes, rising corporate costs, restrained public investment and the stricter interest rate environment all have a restraining impact on domestic demand. The difficulties affecting international production chains have eased further in recent months; however, the war and the related sanctions continue to create considerable uncertainty. Despite subdued global economic activity, an increase in Hungary's foreign market share and an improvement in net exports are expected, due to growing domestic export capacities, which is also supported by the dynamic expansion of battery production. In November 2022, annual inflation was 22.5 percent and core inflation stood at 23.9 percent. The increase in inflation was mainly explained by a pick-up in food price inflation. Inflation expectations continue to be elevated; however, companies' expectations for retail and services prices have remained below their peak levels seen in the summer. The termination of the price cap on fuels and higher-than-expected food prices have pushed the inflation path significantly higher than expected in September. From the beginning of 2023, the slowdown in inflation will be supported by both external and domestic factors. The expected moderation in global energy and commodity prices, as well as international freight costs, easing tensions in value chains, and the slowdown in global economic activity are likely to moderate external inflation further. Regarding internal factors, the fading of the base effects of tax measures and the moderating effect on pricing arising from the fall in domestic demand will support a decline in domestic inflation as well. Tight monetary conditions contribute to avoiding second-round inflationary effects and anchoring inflation expectations. Domestic inflation is expected to decrease slowly in the first half of 2023, and then more significantly from the middle of the year. The consumer price index will return to the central bank tolerance band in 2024. The measures announced by the Government and their implementation are expected to ensure the achievement of this year's budget deficit target indicated by the Ministry of Finance. Thus, the government debt-to-GDP ratio will decrease to close to 74 percent of GDP by the end of 2022. In the autumn months, the current account deficit started to decrease as gas prices fell and domestic demand adjusted. From 2023, the increasing surplus in items of the current account excluding the energy balance and growing adjustment in the energy market might lead to a rapid improvement. With the normalising global economic environment and terms of trade, as well as with the utilisation of new export capacities built recently, the trade balance will improve significantly, resulting in a further reduction in the current account deficit. The agreement on the Hungarian Recovery and Resilience Facility has significantly reduced uncertainties related to EU funds. The Monetary Council kept the base rate at 13.00 percent at its meeting today. In addition, the O/N deposit rate and the O/N collateralised borrowing rate were left unchanged at 12.50 percent and 25.00 percent, respectively. The Monetary Council highlighted two alternative scenarios around the baseline projection in the December Inflation Report. The risk scenario with decelerating global economic activity assumes lower growth and inflation than in the baseline scenario. The scenario that presents the strengthening risk of second-round inflationary effects presumes a higher inflation and slightly higher growth path compared to the baseline scenario. The current level of the base rate is adequate to manage fundamental inflation risks, while monetary tightening continues with the reduction of interbank liquidity. The MNB held a two-month deposit tender at the end of November to tie up banking sector liquidity over a longer term. Furthermore, from the beginning of December the Bank again has been conducting FX swap tenders providing euro liquidity and discount bill auctions with maturities extending beyond the end of the year. With its active market presence, the MNB increases the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. The targeted measures taken by the Bank in mid-October led to an improvement in financial market stability in a rapidly changing risk environment. The one-day deposit quick tenders and FX swap transactions result in tighter interest rate conditions at the short end of the yield curve. In the coming months, the MNB will continue to meet foreign currency liquidity needs to reach market balance related to the energy account. In the Monetary Council's assessment, maintaining the current level of the base rate for a prolonged period is required to achieve the price stability objective over the monetary policy horizon. The Council is constantly assessing incoming data and developments in the outlook for inflation and is ready to take appropriate actions if risks increase. The continued use of instruments reducing interbank forint liquidity strengthens the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission in a targeted manner. Looking ahead, maintaining market stability is also key to achieving price stability. In the Monetary Council's view, the agreement on EU funds is a favourable development. However, the MNB still focuses on sustained shifts in financial market conditions, and it will use its instruments introduced in mid-October until a trend improvement in risk perceptions occurs. It is necessary to maintain tight monetary conditions over a prolonged period, which will ensure that inflation expectations are anchored and the inflation target is achieved in a sustainable manner."
Georgia,2022-12-21,"21.12.2022 THE NATIONAL BANK OF GEORGIA KEEPS ITS MONETARY POLICY RATE UNCHANGED AT 11.0 PERCENT On December 21, 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) decided to keep the monetary policy rate (refinancing rate) unchanged. The monetary policy rate stands at 11.0 percent. Russia's invasion in Ukraine has led to significant global economic disturbances and further exacerbated supply-demand imbalances already in place due to the pandemic. Recently however, there have appeared signs of price stabilization on international commodity markets. As a result of the sanctions lately imposed by the European Union, oil prices have decreased. At the same time, international shipping costs continue to fall at a rapid pace, which should be reflected in import prices. In Georgia inflation has already retreated from its peak and, even though it still remains at a high level at 10.4 percent in November, is now on a downward path. It is expected that given the appreciated exchange rate, the aforementioned global trends will be gradually transmitted to the local market, helping to further reduce inflation. However, it is worth noting that, given current geopolitical circumstances, uncertainty is still high and risks to inflation are mostly on the upside. At the same time, inflation has long deviated away from its target level, further amplifying inflation expectations and creating risks that nominal wage growth may significantly exceed the productivity growth. Inflationary effects stemming from demand are also noteworthy. Economic activity continues to be strong. The Russia-Ukraine war and the accompanying sanctions imposed on Russia have significantly increased migration flows into Georgia, boosting aggregate demand. According to preliminary estimates, economic growth in October was 8.3 percent while averaging 10.0 percent in the first ten months of 2022. According to the NBG's estimates, the current level of economic activity exceeds its potential level, which hinders the slowdown in inflation even with the strengthening of the lari exchange rate as a result of foreign inflows. In response to these risks, the NBG maintains a tight monetary policy. As a result of the tight monetary policy and the recently implemented macroprudential measures, credit growth continued to decelerate. It is expected that these dynamics will persist in the future. At the same time, since the NBG maintains the remuneration on reserve requirements in the US dollar and Euro fixed at 0 percent, the gradual tightening of monetary policies by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve further strengthens the effects of the policy tightening on foreign currency loans in Georgia. It should also be noted that the increase in the countercyclical capital buffer announced at the most recent meeting of the Financial Stability Committee will also have a tightening effect on credit activity. Fiscal deficit is shrinking as well. The combination of these factors will neutralize demand-side inflationary pressures, which will help inflation decelerate. It is expected that the annual inflation will continue a gradual decline and will approach the target level in the second half of 2023. It should be emphasized that taking into account the existing inflationary risks, tight monetary policy will be maintained in the near future and its normalization will only begin gradually and only after a clear trend of decreasing inflation is observed. On the other hand, if the inflation expectations rise and/or additional demand-side price pressures emerge, further tightening of policy or maintaining the current tight stance for a longer period might be necessary. If needed, the National Bank of Georgia will also use additional instruments to avoid inflationary pressure arising from the demand side. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on February 1, 2023."
Egypt,2022-12-22,"Press Release  December 22nd, 2022 MPC decided to raise key policy rates by 300 basis points In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 300 basis points to 1625 percent, 1725 percent, and 1675 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also raised by 300 basis points to 1675 percen. On the global front, forecasts for international commodity prices have slightly eased compared to those underlying the previous MPC meetin. In addition, financial conditions broadly stabilized, with several central banks indicating that their inflation may have peaked and potentially started its deceleration pat. Nonetheless the outlook for international commodity prices remains uncertain, as several factors contribute to upside and downside pressure. Notable factors include the expected global economic slowdown, the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions in China, and the continued uncertainty from the Russia-Ukraine conflict on the overall outlook for global supply chain. Domestically economic activity picked up in 2022 Q3, registering a preliminary figure of 44 percent compared to 33 percent in 2022 Q2. Real GDP growth was primarily driven by the positive contributions of agriculture, wholesale and retail trade and touris. Additionally most leading indicators continue to register positive growth rates in 2022 Q4. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate recorded 74 percent in 2022 Q3, slightly up from the 72 percent recorded in the previous quarte. Annual headline urban inflation continued to accelerate further during 2022 Q4, reaching 187 percent in November 2022, its highest rate since December 201. Similarly annual core inflation continued its upward trend that started over a year ago, recording 215 percent in November 2022, its highest rate since November 201. November's 2022 inflation figure was mainly impacted by the depreciation of the Egyptian pound that took place in October 2022, as well as the higher broad money growth and the ongoing repercussions of the Russia-Ukraine conflic. Since the beginning of calendar year 2022, annual food inflation was mainly driven by core food inflatio. Moreover the annual inflation of services was mainly driven by expenditure on restaurants and cafes, while the increase in retail items was broad-base. Given these developments, annual headline inflation is expected to remain above the MPC's preannounced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q. The MPC judges that demand side pressures have recently increased, as evidenced by developments in real economic activity relative to potential capacity, higher broad-based inflation outturns, and higher broad money growt. In accordance with the CBE's resolve to achieve price stability over the medium term and in line with the preannounced disinflation target path, the MPC has set its upcoming inflation targets at 7 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2024 Q4 and 5 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2026 Q. Against this background, the MPC decided to raise key policy rates by 300 bps to contain inflationary pressures and to steer annual headline inflation rates towards its upcoming targeted level. The committee notes that the future path of inflation remains a function of the cumulative tightening in its stance to date and the lag with which monetary policy tools operat. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will continue to utilize all available monetary policy tools to anchor inflation expectations, contain demand-side pressures and second- round effects emanating from supply shocks that may lead to deviations from inflation target. The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations, rather than of prevailing inflation rates and will continue to pursue its price stability mandat.

Turkiye,2022-12-22,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 9 percent. Leading indicators point to continuation of recession concerns in developed economies as a result of ongoing geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the high level in producer and consumer inflation continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue to increase due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. Additionally, financial markets started to adjust their expectations that the central banks would end the rate hike cycles in the near term on the back of the increasing recession risks. A strong growth was observed in the first three quarters of 2022. Leading indicators for the last quarter of the year continue pointing to a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand. However, the effects of foreign demand-based pressures observed in the manufacturing industry on domestic demand and supply capacity currently remain limited. Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues. On the other hand, high level of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. The Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and the entire policy toolset, particularly funding channels, will be aligned with liraization targets. The comprehensive set of policies to be implemented will be published in the 2023 Monetary and Exchange Rate document in December. Increase in inflation has been driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs resulting from geopolitical developments, effects of pricing formations that are not supported by economic fundamentals, strong negative supply shocks caused by the rise in global energy, food and agricultural commodity prices. The Committee expects disinflation process to start on the back of measures taken and decisively implemented for strengthening sustainable price and financial stability along with the resolution of the ongoing regional conflict. The effects of slowing foreign demand on aggregate demand conditions and production are closely monitored. It is critically important that financial conditions remain supportive for the sustainability of structural gains in supply and investment capacity by preserving the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as further escalation of geopolitical risks. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. Considering the increasing risks regarding global demand, the Committee evaluated that the current policy rate is adequate. To create an institutional basis for sustainable price stability, the comprehensive review of the policy framework continues with the aim of encouraging permanent and strengthened liraization in all policy tools of the CBRT. The credit, collateral and liquidity policy actions, of which the review process is finalized, will continue to be implemented to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
