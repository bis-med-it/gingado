Peru,2007-01-04,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU PRESS RELEASE MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2007 BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 4.50% The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the reference interest rate for the interbank market at 4.50 percent, considering that no inflationary pressures are expected in the short term and that the factors that have driven the inflation rate below the target range are transitory. These include the lower prices of fuels, of public utilities and of some food products which are expected to have a one-time impact on the inflation rate. The inflation targeting scheme implemented by the Central Bank since 2002 involves a series of preventive monetary measures to maintain inflation within the target range of between 1.5 and 3.5 percent. The inflation targeting regime considers the possibility of transitory diversions from the target range which fall out of the control of central banks and which are not deemed to require particular monetary measures to address them given their temporary nature. The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.03 percent in December 2006, as a result of which the last-12-month CPI inflation rate was 1.14 percent below the lower band of the inflation target (1.5  2.5 percent) in line with the trend forecast in the Central Bank's inflation report of September and with the announced monetary program for December. This lower inflation rate is associated with the lower prices of fuels, of electricity and telephone rates, and of some food products. The rate of core inflation a trend indicator of price increases was 0.15 percent in December, as a result of which last-12-month core inflation has increased from1.23 percent in 2004 and2005 to1.4 percent in 2006. The last-12-month inflation rate is expected to remain below the lower band of the inflation target (1.5 percent) in the first part of 2007 due to the reversal of the price rises of some food products observed in the first four months of 2006, as these factors have a one-time impact on inflation and therefore require no particular monetary policy measures to address them. The acceleration of economic activity since 2005, with growth rates of domestic demand of around 10 percent during 2006, has been coupled by low levels of inflation. This evolution isexplained by productivity increases in the economy as well as by the appreciation of the nuevo sol. In addition to this, business expectations on inflation are stable. BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU In this context, the Central Bank will continue evaluating all relevant macroeconomic information and will stand ready to take any necessary measure to ensure that inflation continues to be within the target range (1.5  3.5 percent). Particularly, the Central Bank will oversee that an increased domestic spending that might exceed the improvements observed in terms of productivity is not translated into inflationary pressures. In the last twelve months, the nominal exchange rate decreased 6.4 percent relative to the dollar, while the real exchange rate (considering the currency fluctuations of our main trading partners and relative inflation in these countries) declined less 1.3 percent in a context of unprecedented increased terms of trade(26 percent) over the last 50 years. The interbank reference interest rate has been 4.5 percent since May 2006, and the average monthly interest rate for the interbank market was 4.51 percent in December. The short-term rates are relatively stable and long- term rates in domestic currency continue to exhibit a decreasing tendency. Thus, the average 90-day corporate prime rate for credit in soles was 5.23 percent in December, decreasing 2 bps. with respect to November. On the other hand, the yield on the 20-year sovereign bond in soles decreased for the seventh consecutive month and fell from 6.88 percent in November to 6.58 percent in December. During the session, the Board of Directors approved the following annual interest rates for active and passive operations between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct temporary purchases of securities and rediscount operations: 5.25 percent. Overnight deposits: 3.75 percent. Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the following annual interest rates for operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system: Rediscount operations: 1-monthLIBORplus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage point. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.25 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 2.75 percent. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (for the month of February) on the session to be held on February 8, 2007. In 2007, the Board of the Central Bank will approve the Monetary Program for each month according to the following schedule: BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU February8 March 8 April3 May 3 June 7 July 5 August 2 September 6 October 4 November8 December 6 Likewise, the BCRP will publishits Inflation Reports on the following dates: February9 June 8 October 5."
Israel,2007-01-10,"10.1.2007 The Governor of the Bank of Israel: The Bank of Israel's interest rate policy, together with the Ministry of Finance's budget policy, led to important economic achievements in 2006 - rapid growth, financial stability and low inflation The Bank of Israel's interest rate policy is expected to bring inflation back to within its target range during 2007 The Israelieconomy demonstrated impressive achievements in 2006--rapid growth, financial stability and low inflation--despite external events such as the hostilities in the north. The Bank of Israel's interest rate policy succeeded in supporting economic stability while maintaining low inflation. However inflation for 2006, based on estimates of the consumer price index for December and the cumulative CPI since January 2006,is expected to be close to zero, below the inflation target of 1-3 percent. The Bank of Israel expects to continue its measured interest ratepolicy and to bring inflation gradually back to within the target range during 2007, while avoiding unnecessary fluctuations in the financial markets. In the first half of 2006, inflation over the previous 12 months was higher than the target range (that is above 3 percent), principally due to the effects of rising energy prices worldwide. At the time, the Bank of Israel continued itsflexible approach regarding its monetary policy, with the aim of bringing inflation back to within its target range within the year. The Bank of Israel expected to achieve this around mid-2006, as indeed happened. The secondhalf of the year saw particularly low levels of CPI inflation, mainly against the background of the effects of a shekel appreciating vis-?-vis the dollar, as well as developments in the global and Israeli economies. These developments reflect the strength of the Israeli economy: an impressive current account surplus in the balance of payments, and inward foreign investment. These were the words of the Governor of the Bank of Israel. Professor Stanley Fischer,in a press conference today in which he presented a summary of the Bank ofIsrael's interest rate policy for 2006 and the Bank's assessments for 2007. In summing up 2006, the Governor said that the Bank of Israel believes that the ability of the economy to continue growing in 2006, despite the political changesand the fighting in the north in the summer, while maintaining financial stability and price stability, are a credit to the policy makers--the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Israel--as well as the business sector, which continued to function and develop even during the time of hostilities in the north. During the war, the Bank of Israel raised the interest rate in order to signal to the local and global markets its determination to maintain price and financial stability. This policy, against a background of the Ministry of Finance's disciplined budget policy, allowed the interest rate to be cut cumulatively in recent months leading to a significant negative gap between the Bank of Israel's interest rateand that of the US Federal Reserve, the Governor pointed out. Inflation is expected to return to within its target range by Q 4 2007 In 2007, the Bank of Israel will continue its policy of attempting to return inflationgradually to within the target range. Just as too sharp a rise in the interest rate was not required in the first half of 2006, when inflation was higher than the target range, so now a policy of cutting the interest rate too aggressively is similarly uncalled for. Such sharp changes in the interest rate could cause excessive fluctuations in inflation and output. The Bankof Israel will therefore continue to adjust the interest rate when required, according to the its analysis of developments prior to its monthly decision. By the Bank's assessments, inflation over the past 12 months is expected to return to within the target range by the fourth quarter of 2007. The Bank's monetary policy up to now, and particularly the cumulative interest rate reduction of a full percentage point in recent months, as well as the monetary policy for 2007, will act to strengthen the probability that this will be the outcome for inflation. It is also important to note that unexpected events could affect inflation during the year, for example, changes in the price of oil or fluctuations in the exchange rate, and that inflation during 2007 could accordingly differ from current assessments. Therefore, the Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments, in order to manage monetary policy in a way that is consistent with achieving the price-stability target over a horizon of about ayear. 10.1.2007 The Governor of the Bank of Israel: The Bank of Israel's interest rate policy, together with the Ministry of Finance's budget policy, led to important economic achievements in 2006 - rapid growth, financial stability and low inflation The Bank of Israel's interest rate policy is expected to bring inflation back to within its target range during 2007.

Chile,2007-01-11,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 11 January 2007 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to reduce the monetary policy interest rate from 5.25% to 5% (annual). The information accumulated in the past few months configures a low- inflation scenario for coming quarters that justifies this reduction in the interest rate, in order to assure that the inflation rate converges to 3% in the policy horizon, that is, around two years. The external scenario relevant to the Chilean economy continues to be favorable. Despite the US economic deceleration, global growth continues to be strong, while international financial conditions remain favorable. On the other hand, prices of oil and copper have dropped in recent weeks, showing a partial normalization that has been faster than expected. Information available suggests that, although domestic activity recovered some dynamism, gaps originating in the unforeseen decline in growth of last year will persist for several quarters. This occurs despite the vigorous expansion of domestic demand, especially consumption, increased salaried employment and reduced unemployment. Internal financial conditions remain favorable. Headline and core inflation are between 2% and 3%, considerably below earlier projections. These measures have been influenced, aside from the drop in oil prices, by wider output gaps and reduced cost pressures. Other trend inflation indicators are still low, although some of them are showing early signs of a reversal, explained by seemingly one-time factors. Projections are that in the short term, inflation will temporarily approach 3% because of a basis of comparison effect, to later come close to 2% for a few quarters and converge to 3% in about two years. The Board reaffirms its commitment of conducting monetary policy to assure that projected inflation will be at 3% over the policy horizon. Future changes in the monetary policy rate intended to achieve this objective will depend on incoming information and its implications for projected inflation. * The Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2007-01-11,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our first press conference in 2007. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Slovenia as the thirteenth country to adopt the euro as its currency. Accordingly. Mr Gaspari, the Governor of Banka Slovenije, became a member of the Governing Council on 1 January 2007. Let me now report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in December. It has also confirmed that very close monitoring of all developments is of the essence so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will permit medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area to remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Our monetary policy continues to be accommodative, with the key ECB interest rates remaining at low levels, money and credit growth very strong, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. Turning first to the economic analysis, quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the euro area was 0.5% in the third quarter of 2006, after very strong growth in the first half of last year. Domestic demand remained the main driver of economic growth, thus confirming the anticipated broadening of the recovery and pointing to the increasingly self-sustaining nature of economic expansion in the euro area. Drawing on the latest information, the evidence from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates supports the assessment that robust economic growth has continued and that the situation in labour markets has improved further. While some volatility in the quarter-on-quarter growth rates around the turn of the year may be observed  associated with the impact of changes in indirect taxes in a large euro area country  the information available continues to be in line with our baseline scenario. Looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic activity continues to be favourable and the conditions remain for the euro area economy to grow solidly, at rates around potential. As for the external environment, global economic growth has become more balanced across regions, with some deceleration in the US and resilient growth elsewhere. Overall, global growth should remain robust and therefore continue to provide support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is expected to maintain its momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions continue to improve. In the Governing Council's view, the risks surrounding this broadly favourable outlook for economic growth over the coming years lie mainly on the downside. The main risks relate to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, and concerns about possible disorderly developments due to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 1.9% in December 2006, unchanged from the previous month. On account of their volatility over recent months, and owing to base effects, energy prices will continue to play an important role in determining the profile of annual rates of HICP inflation in early 2007, together with the impact of higher indirect taxes. Looking further ahead, annual inflation rates are projected to hover around 2% over this year and next. In the Governing Council's view, the outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks, stemming in particular from a stronger than anticipated pass-through of previous oil price increases, increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far, and the possibility of renewed oil price increases. More fundamentally, given the favourable momentum of real GDP growth over the past few quarters and positive labour market developments, wage dynamics could be stronger than currently expected. It is therefore crucial that social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. In this context, wage agreements should take into account productivity developments, while recognising the still high level of unemployment and price competitiveness positions. As stated on previous occasions, it is also important that wage settlements move away from automatic, backward-looking indexation mechanisms. Turning to the monetary analysis, annual M3 growth rose to 9.3% in November. This represents its highest annual rate of growth since the introduction of the euro and, indeed, its strongest aggregate growth in the euro area group of countries since 1990. While the significance of monthly figures should not be overstated, as they may also be influenced by temporary factors, the series of strong monetary data over the past couple of months underscore the continued very dynamic underlying rate of broad money expansion in the euro area. Rising short-term interest rates, in combination with low long-term interest rates, have exerted only a limited influence over monetary developments in recent months. This has mainly taken the form of shifts among the components of M3 rather than constraining the overall expansion of M3 itself. In particular, over recent months the annual growth rate of M1 has moderated somewhat, reflecting shifts from overnight deposits into other components of M3 that offer more market-related returns. All in all, the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid, reflecting the low level of interest rates and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. In particular, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector was 11.2% in November, unchanged from the previous month. While  in the context of rising interest rates  the growth of household borrowing has shown signs of stabilisation in recent months, albeit at very high rates, the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations continues to trend upwards. Thus, credit continues to expand rapidly and in a broad-based fashion, thereby remaining the main driver of the current strong monetary growth when viewed from the counterpart side of the MFI balance sheet. Taking a medium to longer-term perspective, the latest developments are consistent with a continuation of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion. Following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. Continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to hover around 2% this year and next, with risks to this outlook remaining on the upside. Given the very strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. Hence, very close monitoring of all developments is of the essence in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will permit medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area to remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. As regards fiscal policy, almost all euro area countries have submitted their updated stability programmes. While these programmes generally indicate that governments plan to proceed towards sound budgetary positions, there are also indications that budget targets do not consistently imply sufficient consolidation and that concrete and credible measures have not yet been specified in all programmes. These indications are a cause of concern and entail risks for the future. Against the background of current good times, it is essential that sound budgetary positions are reached in countries with fiscal imbalances and that a pro-cyclical loosening is avoided in all member countries. Moreover, countries need to improve the quality of their tax and expenditure policies as part of a comprehensive medium-term strategy, so as to strengthen confidence in a growth and employment-friendly, and sustainable, fiscal policy environment. With regard to structural reforms, over recent years euro area countries have become increasingly aware of the necessity to adjust to the challenges of increased global competition, ageing populations and accelerating technological change. In response, some have undertaken reform efforts to create more job opportunities. Both as a reflection of these reforms and as a result of wage moderation in some countries, the euro area has seen a remarkable dynamism in employment growth over the recent period. Notably, around 12 million new jobs were created in the euro area in the eight-year period since the start of Stage Three of EMU. This compares favourably with the little more than two million new jobs created in the same group of countries in the eight years before 1999. However, the Governing Council notes that significant structural impediments continue to exist and contribute to explaining why unemployment rates are still unacceptably high and participation in the labour market is still low by international standards. With other countries in the world also increasing the competitiveness of their markets, it is essential for each euro area country to minimise the market distortions induced by its particular regulations and for the euro area as a whole to remove remaining barriers to market integration. This requires the implementation of comprehensive reforms necessary to deepen market integration, soften labour market rigidities and improve wage flexibility in order to continue fostering growth and new employment opportunities."
South Korea,2007-01-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). In the real economy, exports continue to show steady growth, facilities investment maintains a growing pace and construction investment appears to be recovering. On the other hand, private consumption exhibits a slowdown in the pace of its expansion. Meanwhile, the current account has running a large surplus, thanks to the widened goods account surplus. Consumer price inflation and core inflation both remain stable. The upward pace of real estate prices has shown a signs of slowdown. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions' lending has increased steadily. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period."
Turkiye,2007-01-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep short-term interest rates (policy rates) unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 17.50 percent, and lending rate at 22.50 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m.  4:30 p.m. at 13.50 percent, lending rate at 25.50 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 21.50 percent. The Committee evaluates the recent data as broadly consistent with the outlook presented in the October Inflation Report. While the slowdown in the private consumption demand continues, the external demand remains relatively strong. Although economic activity has shown a tendency to recover in the last quarter of 2006, overall demand conditions continue to support disinflation. Inflation expectations continue to improve. Nevertheless, the gap between the medium-term inflation expectations and the targets, the risks related to the services price inflation, and the uncertainties in the global economy necessitate keeping the tight policy stance. Moreover, the Committee notes the support from oil prices to the inflation outlook, as well as the uncertainties regarding the unprocessed food prices. In light of these developments, the Committee assesses that meeting the medium term inflation targets would necessitate the maintenance of the cautious policy stance. The Committee closely monitors the lagged effects of the monetary tightening since June 2006. Moreover, the potential impact of the progress in the structural reform agenda and the developments in the incomes policy as well as the public sector non-interest expenditures on the inflation and the inflation expectations are carefully evaluated. The Central Bank will not hesitate to tighten monetary policy in case of any new developments that would adversely affect the medium-term inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook will lead the Committee to reconsider its stance. A brief summary of the assessments of the Committee will be released within eight working days.

Thailand,2007-01-17,"No 2 /2007 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 17 January 2007 Ms. Suchada Kirakul. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed are as follows. Latest economic indicators point towards a slowdown in domestic demand. In particular, consumption and investment in the first two months of the fourth quarter of 2006 showed a continued moderation from the previous quarter. Despite an expansion in exports, risks remain given the prospects of a slowdown in the global economy in 2007. On the other hand, inflationary pressures are expected to moderate, particularly from lower oil prices, significantly reducing the chances that core inflation will exceed the target band over the next two years. The MPC viewed that inflationary pressures have moderated, while the risks to growth have increased. Therefore monetary policy could be eased in support of a further expansion of the economy. The MPC thus decided to lower the 1-day repurchase rate from 49375 per cent per annum to 475 per cent per annum, with the 1-day repurchase rate replacing the 14-day repurchase rate as the policy rate, effective today.

Hungary,2007-01-22,"1. At its meeting on 22 January 2007, the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 8.00%. Economic data released since the latest policy meeting have not altered the Monetary Council's view of the Hungarian economy materially. According to the underlying measures of inflation, the general picture is one of a significantly higher inflation environment than the level implied by price stability. In contrast with individual factors driving price developments, for example, consumption demand, the exchange rate and oil prices, which point to a slowdown in inflation, the rate of wage growth continues to be higher than expected. The latest wage data indicate that the growth of wages in the private sector has been high recently. This strong growth has emerged against the background of a loosening of labour market conditions. However, it is too early to tell whether this process reflects a deterioration in inflation expectations or an adjustment to changes in the regulatory environment. Recent output data have reinforced earlier signs of a widening in the gap between external and domestic demand growth. The rise in the volume of output in November suggests that industrial activity remains buoyant. In the Council's judgement, the risks to future inflation are significant and highly likely to persist in the months ahead. In view of the uncertainties, the Council will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully and will aim to prevent potential upward effects of one-off measures on the general price level through higher expectations from triggering a spillover into higher inflation. The Council's evaluation of the achievement of the 2006 inflation target. The annual rate of inflation in December 2006, at 6.5%, was higher than the 3.5% target set for end-2006, and was also outside the ±1% tolerance band. In 2006, the inflation target could not be met in large part because of factors outside the influence of monetary policy. The average rate of consumer price inflation in 2006 was 3.9% and that of core inflation was 2.3%. As a positive effect of factors determining inflation, the rate of price increases had come close to the level implying price stability by end-2005 and early 2006, with the risks to economic balance remaining particularly pronounced. The favourable underlying developments in, and the benign outlook for, inflation, coupled with the necessity of fiscal adjustment, characterised the picture of the Hungarian economy up to mid-2006. A slowdown in tradables inflation was the major driving force behind good inflation performance, which was explained by the combination of a disinflation of tradable prices globally. Hungary joining the European Union and the transformation of trade patterns in the wake of the accession. In addition, reaching a level close to price stability was also supported by the stable and strong exchange rate as well as by wage inflation which was becoming increasingly in tune with price stability. Inflation reached a turning point in mid-2006, with inflationary pressures rising across a broad range of products. The Monetary Council expected the effects of intensifying competition in earlier years to unwind and core inflation to pick up. In mid-2006, however, there were signs suggesting that inflation would rise at a faster rate than expected earlier, due to the sharp increase in unprocessed food prices, the pick-up in wage inflation and the weakening exchange rate. From September, as a consequence of the measures taken by the Government, administered prices rose strongly, and the increase in indirect taxes affected a wide range of product prices. These measures contributed significantly to inflation in December exceeding the target by 3 percentage points. Beyond the direct inflationary effects, the measures may cause changes in pricing behaviour and wage agreements. The Monetary Council, therefore, clearly reaffirms its commitment to meet the medium-term inflation target; and it will continue to aim to anchor inflation expectations and stabilise inflation around 3%."
Philippines,2007-01-24,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to leave the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The tiering system on bank placements with the BSP was also kept in place. The Monetary Board noted during its assessment that the outlook for inflation has largely eased since its previous policy meeting. Supply-side pressures have diminished noticeably in recent months. Meanwhile, demand-side pressures continue to be minimal thus far, although latest data show moderate improvements across demand indicators. More importantly, latest BSP forecasts for 2007 and 2008 show that in the absence of further adverse shocks, average inflation may edge closer to the lower end of the 4.0-5.0 percent target range for 2007 and the 4.0 percent ± 1.0 percent target for 2008. Nevertheless, the Monetary Board believes that, on balance, there continue to be sufficient grounds for caution in the monetary stance. More time is needed to allow the impact of the tiering system to fully wind its way through the credit channel. A prudent pause is only appropriate particularly in light of the continued strong growth in liquidity and the downtrend in interest rates. Caution in adjusting policy settings is also important in light of various upside risks to inflation, which include various cost-side adjustments. There is also some uncertainty as to whether the recent moderation in supply-side pressures will continue, given the vulnerability of energy prices to geopolitical disruptions and the risk to food prices from a stronger El Niño episode. In addition, inflation expectations, while manageable at present, are also at risk from anticipated increases in public expenditure and possible large adjustments in nominal wages. The Monetary Board remains firmly committed to addressing the risks to future inflation and will continue to monitor closely the evolving conditions for consumer prices, aggregate demand, domestic liquidity and other factors in order to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
Czech Republic,2007-01-25,"Press Conference of the CNB Bank Board 1st Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 25 January 2007 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting, the Board decided to leave the CNB two-week repo rate unchanged at 2.50 %. All six board members present voted in favour of this decision. Compared to the October forecast the rate of growth is slightly lower in 2007 and 2008. Expected inflation pressures from the real economy are similar compared to the October forecast for the beginning of the forecasting period. They grow in the beginning of the year 2007, but decline during the year. In 2008, the real economy will have an antiinflationary effect. Compared to the October forecast, inflation is lower in 2007 and 2008 but this difference gradually decreases during 2008.

Malaysia,2007-01-26,"At its meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. The Malaysian economy is expected to maintain a steady growth path in 2007. Some weakening in the international economic conditions could affect export growth. The economic growth momentum is however expected to be sustained by domestic demand, supported by both private and public spending. Inflation is expected to be contained in 2007 due to lower import prices and expansion of domestic capacity. Cost driven price pressures are also likely to be moderate. Based on this assessment, the current level of the OPR is consistent with the medium term outlook for growth and inflation. Bank Negara Malaysia 26 January 2007."
Israel,2007-01-29,"29.1.2007</td> The Bank of Israel lowers the interest rate for February 2007 by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent The Bank ofIsrael announces that the interest rate for February 2007 will be lowered by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent. This step is consistent with the policyof maintaining price stability in the long run, in accordance with the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions The Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained unchanged in December, slightly above expectations. Over the year 2006, the CPI changed minimally by -0.1 percent, below the inflation target range of 1-3 percent. However domesticprices-- prices that are not influenced directly by changes in the exchange rate--rose by more than 2 percent in annual terms. Following the cumulative fall of 1.8 percent in the CPI from September to November 2006, inflation over the past 12 months is expected to belower than the target for the first three quarters of 2007. Inflation expectations for the next year derived from the capital market were close to 1 percent in January 2007, after falling in the last quarter of 2006 from about 2 percent, the level around which expectations fluctuated in the first three quarters of last year. Expectations derived from the yield curve imply a further reduction in the interest rate in the course of the next twelve months. Forecasters predict an inflation rate for the next 12 months of 1.9 percent, close to the midpoint of the target range. They also expect, on average, that the Bank of Israel interest rate will reach 4.5 percent at the end of 2007. The econometric models of the Bank of Israel point to a relatively high probability that inflation for 2007 (taken over the preceding 12 months) will come within the inflation target range in the fourth quarter of 2007, subject to a modest reduction in the interest rate, mainly in the first quarter of the year. National accounts data show a return to the high rate of economic growth that characterized the economy in the first half of 2006. The Bank of Israel's CompaniesSurvey also shows a continued rise in activities in most industries and anexpectation of continued expansion in the first quarter of 2007. The composite state-of-the-economy index in December and the revision upward of preceding months also indicate a strengthening of real activity. According to trend data in October and November of last year, the unemployment rate stands at 8.3 percent. This rate confirms the large fall registered in unemployment in the third quarter of 2006, to 8.3 percent, down from 8.8 percent in the second quarter. The tourism industry registered a rise in hotel nights (seasonally adjusted) at a rate in line with the rising trend seen after the sharp decline following the fighting in the north. Nonresidents' flow of investments in Israel continued in December, following the trend set since the beginning of 2006. Furthermore, exports continued torise faster than imports creating a significant current account surplus in the balance of payments, which reached about 5 percent of GDP in the year 2006. In the international financial markets, there was a further significant drop in Israel's risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, and in the yield gap between fixed-rate, 10-year Shahar local-currency bonds and 10-year US government bonds. In January, the negative interest rate gap between the interest rates set by the Bank of Israel and the US Federal Reserve reached 75 basis points. The US capital markets expect no change in the Fed rate in the coming month. Furthermore, the interest rate in Europe is on a rising trend. The generalbudget deficit in 2006 totaled about 0.9 percent of GDP, below the plannedceiling. This was despite the fighting in the north. The 2007 budget, as approved by the government, was passed by the Knesset soon after the end of 2006, without the delay seen in previous years. According to the budget, the deficit ceiling for the current year is set at 2.9 percent of GDP, although the actual deficit for 2007 is expected to be lower than this. The main considerations behind the decision Recent economic developments have had counterbalancing effects on the rate of inflation. The reduction in the Israeli risk premium and the increase in the current account surplus of the balance of payments tend to strengthen the currency and reduce the inflation rate. The low budget deficit in 2006 and the expectations for a moderate deficit in 2007, reduce the net pressure of government demand on resources and further contribute to lower inflation. By contrast, the rapid growth that has reduced the output gap, tends to increase inflation. This effect has not yet been expressed in developments in theconsumer price index, although there are certainly signs of an effect on local prices, that is, prices that are not directly affected by movements in the exchange rate. In taking these considerations into account, the Bank of Israel concluded that in light of the very low level of inflation, which (measured over the past twelve months) is expected to return to within the target range only in the fourthquarter of this year, a further 25 basis point cut in the interest rate would strengthen the probability that the inflation rate would be close to the center of the target range towards the end of the year. Monthly changes in the CPI, in annual terms, are expected to return to the seasonal path consistent with the mid-point of the inflation target range by the end of the first quarter of the year. The Bank ofIsrael will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular to encourage employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support financial stability. 29.1.2007</td> The Bank of Israel lowers the interest rate for February 2007 by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent.

India,2007-01-31,"RBI Governor announces Third Quarter Review of Annual Statement on Monetary Policy for 2006-07 Dr.Y Venugopal Reddy. Governor. Reserve Bank of India today presented the Third Quarter Review of Annual Statement on Monetary Policy for the Year 2006-07. Highlights Repo Rate increased to 7.50 per cent from 7.25 per cent. Reverse Repo Rate. Bank Rate and Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) kept unchanged. The flexibility to conduct overnight or longer term repo including the right to accept or reject tender(s) under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), wholly or partially is retained. GDP growth forecast at 8.5-9.0 per cent during 2006-07. Inflation to be brought down as close as possible to 5.0-5.5 per cent at the earliest, while continuing to pursue the medium-term goal of a ceiling on inflation at 5.0 per cent. Provisioning requirement increased to two per cent for standard assets in the real estate sector, outstanding credit card receivables, loans and advances qualifying as capital market exposure and personal loans (excluding residential housing loans). Provisioning requirement increased to two per cent for the banks' exposures in the standard assets category to the non-deposit taking systemically important non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). Risk weight increased to 125 per cent for banks' exposure to the non-deposit taking systemically important NBFCs. Interest rate ceiling on NRE deposits reduced from 100 basis points to 50 basis points above LIBOR/SWAP rates for US dollar of corresponding maturity. Interest rate ceiling on FCNR(B) deposits reduced from LIBOR/SWAP rates to 25 basis points below LIBOR/SWAP rates for respective currency/ maturities. Banks are being restrained from granting fresh loans, in excess of Rs. 20 lakh, against NRE and FCNR(B) deposits and being advised not to undertake artificial slicing of the loan amount to circumvent the ceiling. Over the remaining part of the year, management of liquidity would receive priority in the policy hierarchy. Consequent upon the tightening of market liquidity, the impact of monetary policy is expected to be stronger than before.2- The Reserve Bank would use all policy instruments, including the CRR, to ensure the appropriate modulation of liquidity in responding to the evolving situation. The Reserve Bank will ensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained in the system so that all legitimate requirements of credit are met, particularly for productive purposes, consistent with the objective of price and financial stability. Towards this end, the Reserve Bank will continue with its policy of active demand management of liquidity through open market operations (OMO) including the MSS. LAF and CRR, and using all the policy instruments at its disposal flexibly, as and when the situation warrants. Barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy including the outlook for inflation, the overall stance of monetary policy in the period ahead will be: To reinforce the emphasis on price stability and well anchored inflation expectations while ensuring a monetary and interest rate environment that supports export and investment demand in the economy so as to enable continuation of the growth momentum. To re-emphasise credit quality and orderly conditions in financial markets for securing macroeconomic and, in particular, financial stability while simultaneously pursuing greater credit penetration and financial inclusion. To respond swiftly with all possible measures as appropriate to the evolving global and domestic situation impinging on inflation expectations and the growth momentum. Details Domestic Developments Real GDP growth firmed up to 9.1 per cent in the first half of 2006-07 from 8.5 per cent in the first half of 2005-06. Inflation, measured by variations in the wholesale price index (WPI) on a year-on-year (Y-o-Y) basis, rose from its end-March 2006 level of 4.1 per cent to the intra-year peak of 6.1 per cent on January 6, 2007 before marginally declining to 6.0 per cent by January 13, 2007. Prices of primary articles registered a Y-o-Y increase of 9.3 per cent as on January 13, 2007 as compared with an increase of 5.6 per cent a year ago. Manufacturing inflation increased to 5.6 per cent Y-o-Y by January 13, 2007 from 1.9 per cent at the beginning of the current financial year and 2.2 per cent a year ago. Inflation, measured by variations in the consumer price index (CPI) for urban non- manual employees, agricultural labourers and rural labourers showed a sharp Y-o-Y increase to 6.9 per cent, 8.9 per cent and 8.3 per cent in December 2006, respectively, from 5.7 per cent, 4.7 per cent and 4.9 per cent, a year ago. The Y-o-Y inflation, measured by variations in the CPI for industrial workers was placed at 6.3 per cent in November 2006, higher than 5.3 per cent a year ago. The average price of the ‘Indian basket' of international crude decreased to US $ 51.0 per barrel by January 25, 2007 from US $ 67.9 per barrel in July-September, 2006.3- The Y-o-Y growth in money supply (M ) at 20.4 per cent on January 5, 2007 was higher 3 than 16.0 per cent a year ago and above the projected trajectory of 15.0 per cent indicated in the Annual Policy Statement for 2006-07. The Y-o-Y growth in aggregate deposits at Rs.4,38,037 crore (22.5 per cent) was higher than that of Rs.2,85,182 crore (17.2 per cent) a year ago and was also the highest since 1993-94 on a comparable basis. On a Y-o-Y basis, non-food credit expanded by Rs.4,07,735 crore (31.2 per cent) as on January 5, 2007 on top of an increase of Rs.3,11,013 crore (31.2 per cent) a year ago. Banks' holdings of Government and other approved securities fell to 28.6 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities as on January 5, 2007 from 32.6 per cent a year ago. The average liquidity overhang under the LAF. MSS and Centre's surplus cash balances, which was Rs.89,786 crore in April-June, 2006 and Rs.92,354 crore in July- September, 2006 declined to Rs.84,312 crore in October-December, 2006 and further to Rs. 79,221 crore in January (up to January 23, 2007). Stable and orderly conditions in financial markets were interrupted by short episodes of some tightening in the overnight money market in the first half of November and the second half of December with interest rates firming up in almost all segments. Bank deposit rates which had increased by 25-175 basis points in October over April 2006, particularly for the longer end, rose further by 25-50 basis points in December over October 2006, and by 25-125 basis points in January 2007 across various maturities. The weighted average benchmark prime lending rates (BPLRs) of public sector banks increased from 10.71 per cent in March, 2006 to 11.18 per cent in June, 2006 and further to 11.58 per cent in December, 2006. The weighted average BPLRs of private sector banks also increased from 12.37 per cent in March to 12.80 per cent in June and 13.22 per cent in December. The weighted average BPLRs of foreign banks increased from 12.67 per cent to 12.72 per cent during the period. The BSE Sensex rallied with intermittent corrections to reach a high of 14,283 on January 25, 2007. The gross borrowings of the Central Government at Rs.1,25,000 crore (Rs.1,15,000 crore a year ago) through dated securities during 2006-07 so far (up to January 22, 2007) constituted 83.1 per cent of the budget estimates (BE) while net market borrowings at Rs.91,432 crore (Rs.83,079 crore a year ago) constituted 80.4 per cent of the BE. External Sector Exports (in US dollar terms) recorded a growth of 22.0 per cent during April-December 2006 as compared with 29.9 per cent in the corresponding period of 2005. Imports rose by 24.8 per cent as compared with 37.8 per cent a year ago. While petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) imports rose by 39.2 per cent during April- December 2006 (46.9 per cent a year ago), non-oil import growth decelerated to 18.7 per cent from 34.3 per cent a year ago. The foreign exchange reserves rose to US $ 178.1 billion by January 19, 2007 from US $ 151.6 billion at the end of March, 2006.4- The rupee appreciated by 0.8 per cent against the US dollar and by 3.4 per cent against the Japanese yen while it depreciated against euro by 5.5 per cent and against pound sterling by 10.5 per cent during the current financial year so far (up to January 25, 2007). Global Developments According to the IMF's World Economic Outlook of September 2006, global real GDP growth in purchasing power parity terms is expected to accelerate to 5.1 per cent in 2006 from 4.9 per cent in 2005 but will slow down to 4.9 per cent again in 2007. In the US, real GDP growth was 2.0 per cent in the third quarter (July-September) as compared with 5.6 per cent and 2.6 per cent in the first and second quarters, respectively. The slowdown was mainly on account of lower residential fixed investment. Global growth continues to be strong but is exhibiting mixed patterns. There has been a surge in the international prices of cereals. While headline inflation has been moderating mainly on account of the decline in international crude prices, core inflation has generally remained firm. In the global financial markets, risks have become more diversified. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to an all-time intraday high on January 24, 2007. A number of central banks have raised their policy rates, inter-alia, in the UK. Euro area. Australia. China. Korea. Turkey. Saudi Arabia and Iceland. The Government and the People's Bank of China (PBC) have taken a series of measures in a bid to slow down the growth to more sustainable levels and reduce potential inflationary pressures in sensitive sectors. Some central banks have paused in their policy cycle, notably in the US. Canada. Japan. Malaysia and Mexico. A few central banks have eased monetary policy rates, such as in Indonesia. Brazil. Chile and Thailand. Overall Assessment There are shifts underway in the patterns of global growth even while inflation expectations remain stable at present. There are concerns relating to the uncertainty surrounding international crude prices. While crude prices have moderated recently, geo-political risks remain. Central banks are, by and large, persisting with withdrawal of monetary accommodation. While risks to the outlook from the contraction in the US housing market, rising food and metal prices remain, global financial markets remain vulnerable to sudden shifts in expectations and volatility. Global factors, by themselves, do not seem to warrant a policy response; however, corporates and financial intermediaries need to be aware of sudden reversals in sentiment in global financial markets unrelated to economic fundamentals, especially if triggered by geo-political factors. Banks are, therefore, advised to ensure the hedging of their exposures and to undertake pre-emptive strategies to insulate their balance sheets from currency and interest rate risks. In India, recent developments, in particular, the combination of high growth and firming inflation, coupled with escalating asset prices and tightening infrastructural bottlenecks, have complicated the conduct of monetary policy.5- In recognition of the cumulative and lagged effects of monetary policy, the Reserve Bank began a graduated withdrawal of accommodation in mid-2003 in spite of inflation being within its tolerance band. Since September, 2004 repo/reverse repo rates have been increased by 125/150 basis points, the CRR by 100 basis points; the risk weights for housing loans from 50 per cent to 75 per cent, commercial real estate from 100 per cent to 150 per cent and consumer credit from 100 per cent to 125 per cent. Provisioning requirement for standard advances in specific sectors has been raised to 1.0 per cent. The stance of monetary policy has progressively shifted from an equal emphasis on price stability alongside growth to one of reinforcing price stability with immediate monetary measures and to take recourse to all possible measures promptly in response to evolving circumstances. Early warning signals emanating from rising inflation in an environment of high money and credit growth indicate that monetary policy is still accommodative, warranting a policy response in terms of a measured increase in interest rates to assuage demand pressures. There are also abiding concerns relating to the persistently high credit growth and the potential for erosion in the quality of credit so that balance sheets of banks need to be fortified against the build-up of loan delinquencies by precautionary provisioning and a greater sensitivity to underlying risks by enhancement of risk weights applied to advances to specific sectors in which banks' exposures have been rising at a fast pace. There are also indications that capital inflows are likely to be sustained with expansionary effects carrying potential inflationary pressures and attenuating monetary and liquidity management. Therefore, it is important to modulate inflows into non-resident deposit scheme which have recorded sizeable increases during the year so as to ensure effective liquidity management. Stance of Monetary Policy Real GDP growth for 2006-07 is expected to be 8.5-9.0 per cent as compared with 8.0 per cent projected in the Mid-Term Review, and 7.5-8.0 per cent in the Annual Policy Statement and the First Quarter Review. The objective of the policy measures being undertaken at the current juncture would be to bring inflation as close as possible to the stated range of 5.0-5.5 per cent at the earliest, while continuing to pursue the medium-term goal of a ceiling on inflation at 5.0 per cent. The probability of current levels of international crude prices being maintained is high, though some geopolitical risks remain. The conduct of monetary policy is currently confronted with three important issues: first, demand pressures appear to have intensified, reflected in rising inflation, high money and credit growth, elevated asset prices, strains on capacity utilisation, some indications of wage pressures and widening of the trade deficit; second, there are increased supply-side pressures in evidence from prices of primary articles; and third, monetary policy will have to contend with the lagged response of productive capacity and infrastructure to the ongoing expansion in investment. Bank credit continues to grow at a rapid pace for the third year in succession and the rates of growth are clearly excessive, warranting measures to moderate growth even after accounting for the relatively low level of credit penetration in our country and the structural transformation of the economy that is underway.6- The continued high credit growth in the real estate sector, outstanding credit card receivables, loans and advances qualifying as the capital market exposure and personal loans, is a matter of concern. It has, therefore, become imperative to increase the provisioning requirement for these standard assets (excluding residential housing loans) to two per cent from one per cent. Further, it has been decided to increase the provisioning requirement for the banks' exposures in the standard assets category to the non-deposit taking systemically important non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) to two per cent from 0.4 per cent as also the risk weight for the banks' exposure to such NBFCs to 125 per cent from 100 per cent. There is merit in moderating additions to liquidity from large capital inflows and hence, it has been decided to reduce the interest rate ceiling on NRE deposits from 100 basis points to 50 basis points above LIBOR/SWAP rates for US dollar of corresponding maturity, and also to reduce the interest rate ceiling on FCNR(B) deposits from LIBOR/SWAP rates to 25 basis points below LIBOR/SWAP rates for respective currency/ maturities. In order to avoid upward pressure on asset prices in sensitive sectors through utilisation of these facilities, banks are being restrained from granting fresh loans, in excess of Rs. 20 lakh, against the NRE and FCNR(B) deposits and also being advised not to undertake artificial slicing of the loan amount to circumvent the ceiling. Consequent upon the tightening of market liquidity, the impact of monetary policy is expected to be stronger than before. The Reserve Bank would use all policy instruments, including the CRR, to ensure the appropriate modulation of liquidity in responding to the evolving situation; and to ensure the maintenance of price stability. To respond swiftly with all possible measures as appropriate to the evolving global and domestic situation impinging on inflation expectations and the growth momentum.7- Monetary Measures Repo Rate under the LAF is increased by 25 basis points from 7.25 per cent to 7.50 per cent with immediate effect. The Reserve Bank retains the option to conduct overnight repo or longer term repo under the LAF depending on market conditions and other relevant factors. The Reserve Bank will continue to use this flexibility including the right to accept or reject tender(s) under the LAF, wholly or partially, if deemed fit, so as to make efficient use of the LAF in daily liquidity management. Reverse Repo Rate and Bank Rate have been kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent. CRR has been kept unchanged at 5.5 per cent. The Annual Policy Statement for the year 2007-08 will be announced on April 24, 2007. Alpana Killawala Chief General Manager Press Release: 2006-20071028."
Poland,2007-01-31,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 31 January 2007 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 30-31 January 2007 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 4.00% on an annual basis; lombard rate 5.50% on an annual basis; deposit rate 2.50% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.25% on an annual basis. Since the Council's meeting in December 2006 the inflation forecasts for 2007 for the euro area and the United States have remained unchanged. However, forecasts of euro-area economic growth for 2007 has been slightly raised, while forecasts for the United States have been slightly lowered. In December the annual inflation in the euro area remained unchanged (at 1.9%), but in the United States it increased (from 2.0% y/y in November to 2.5% y/y). Since the December meeting of the Council, current price of oil has dropped by USD 8.3 (i.e. 13.3%), while the prices of this commodity forecast for 2007-2008 has declined only slightly. Preliminary GUS data on the GDP in 2006 have confirmed that the Polish economy is currently undergoing a strong and constantly consolidating recovery, which extends to all sectors of the economy. The real GDP in 2006 grew by 5.8% y/y, which was slightly higher than assumed in the January projection. Monthly GUS data for 2006 Q4 on industrial output, construction and assembly production and retail sales indicate that strong economic activity has continued. The rise in industrial output in December 2006 was slightly lower than the expectations of NBP analysts and external forecasters reaching 5.7% y/y (compared with 12.0% y/y in November). However, the growth in construction and assembly output was slightly above the expectations of NBP analysts at 17.9% y/y (compared with 23.3% y/y in November). The annual growth of industrial and also production and assembly output was reduced by the fact that December 2006 had fewer business days than December 2005. In seasonally adjusted terms, industrial output grew by 10.5% y/y (compared with 10.2% y/y in November) and construction and assembly output -- by 26.0% y/y (versus 25.0% y/y in November). Retail sales continued to grow strongly (by 13.3% y/y in nominal terms as compared to 13.6% y/y in November). The growth of lending to non-financial sector has been rising steadily and in December 2006 it reached 23.8% y/y. Since the middle of 2005 growth in consumer loans has been running high (a rise of 21.5% y/y in December). Also the housing loans have been rising quickly (an increase of 54.1% y/y in December). Since 2006 Q2 an acceleration in the growth of corporate loans has been observed (a rise of 14.5% y/y in December). This growth in corporate lending, combined with substantial own funds of enterprises resulting from their very good financial results in the first three quarters of 2006, may indicate that the currently high investment growth will be sustained in the future. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. Strong economic growth is accompanied by a rapid increase in labour demand. Since December 2004 the employment growth in the corporate sector has been accelerating  in December 2006 the growth of employment in enterprises amounted to 4.1% y/y, compared to 3.8% y/y in November, and was the highest since the beginning of the 1990s. According to the data from Labour Offices the unemployment rate in December 2006 was 14.9% (against 17.6% one year earlier). Economic growth is also accompanied by a high growth of wages. In December 2006 the rise in nominal wages in enterprises stepped up to 8.5% y/y from 3.1% y/y in November. This rise in annual wage growth primarily resulted from shifts in one-off components of wages in certain sections. In line with the NBP's estimates, adjusting for the impact of these shifts, the rise in wages in December amounted to 6.2% y/y compared to 5.7% y/y in November. Strong economic growth which would not pose a threat to the achievement of the inflation target can only be sustained on the condition that the growth in wages does not outpace the growth in labour productivity. This requires strong and productivity-oriented corporate governance in enterprises, which is usually more easily achieved in the conditions of private ownership. This also calls for wage discipline in the public sector. In December 2006 the annual growth of consumer prices did not change in relation to the previous month and amounted to 1.4%. The indicators of core inflation did not change significantly in relation to the previous month (in December they remained in the range of 1.1-1.6% y/y, while “net” inflation was 1.6% y/y). In January 2007 inflation expectations of households amounted to 1.5% y/y (compared with 1.0% in December and 1.7% y/y in November). According to GUS business tendency surveys, since the beginning of 2006, the expected prices in retail sales, prices of industrial production as well as construction and assembly output have been gradually increasing. In December the annual growth of producer prices in industry reached 2.8% compared with 2.5% in November (which represented a drop of 0.3% m/m compared with a drop of 0.7% m/m in November), while in manufacturing it was 1.7% (versus 1.1% in November). In December the nominal effective exchange rate of the zloty appreciated 3.4% in year-on-year terms. The Council got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by NBP staff, which will be presented in the January Inflation Report. In line with the projection, the annual GDP growth will be -- with a 50-percent probability -- in the range of 4.9-6.7% in 2007 (compared with 4.1-6.2% in the October projection), 3.6-6.4% in 2008 (compared with 4.5-7.0%) and 3.5-6.5% in 2009. According to the January inflation projection consumer price growth will in the short term be lower, and in the longer term  close to that expected in the October Report. Under constant interest rates, there is a 50-percent probability that inflation will be within the range of 2.1-3.8% in 2007 Q4 (as compared with 1.9-3.8% in the October projection), 2.2-4.5% in 2008 Q4 (as compared with 2.2-4.6%) and 2.4-5.2% in 2009 Q4. The Council got also acquainted with the results of other forecasts conducted at the NBP. In the Council's assessment, in the short term CPI inflation will be considerably lower than in the January projection, as the oil and food prices will most probably be lower then in the projection. The core “net” inflation may also be markedly lower than in the projection. In the medium term, despite the fact that economic growth is expected to slow down somewhat, the growth of wages may gradually increase, thus leading to higher inflation. The Council believes that this increase in inflation will be probably moderate if the strong productivity growth and low growth of external prices associated with globalisation and the ensuing increased competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services continues. -2 - The Council judged that the current level of NBP interest rates is conducive to keeping inflation close to the target of 2.5% in the medium term. However, maintaining inflation close to target and thus creating conditions for sustainable long-term economic growth may require monetary policy tightening. Future decisions of the Council will depend on the incoming information about economic developments in Poland and the world and also on their impact on the inflation outlook in Poland. In the opinion of the Council, the currently observed strong economic growth creates convenient conditions for the implementation of reforms which would permanently reduce the public finance imbalance. The Council maintains its belief that it would be the most favourable for Poland to adopt an economic strategy focused on creating conditions that would guarantee the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date. The constraining of public finance imbalance would be conducive, both per se and by creating conditions for the introduction of the euro, to accelerating the long-term economic growth. In the Monetary Policy Guidelines for the Year 2007 the Council announced that it would try to give a more extensive account of the arguments raised during discussion at its meetings. In compliance with this announcement, starting from the January Inflation Report the Council will present a modified format of the Chapter “Monetary policy”. It will offer a more detailed account of discussions and problems considered at its decision-making meetings than in the past. Starting from May 2007 such record of discussion at a decision-making meeting (minutes) shall be published before the next decision-making meeting of the Council. Simultaneously, the format of the Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be modified. The Council approved The Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland in 2006 Q3. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 27-28 February 2007."
United States,2007-01-31,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. Recent indicators have suggested somewhat firmer economic growth, and some tentative signs of stabilization have appeared in the housing market. Overall, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months, and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time. However, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures. The Committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner.

Egypt,2007-02-01,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release February 1, 2007 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 875 percent per annu. In its meeting held on February 1, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain its overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 875 percent and 1075 percent, respectivel. While the risks to inflation outlook which the MPC drew attention to in previous statements continue to exist, a detailed assessment of the most recent inflation figures may suggest a tentative moderatio. However the annual inflation rates are expected to remain high until the base effect from the previous price increases related to the supply shocks and administered price adjustments level of. Against this background and in light of previous monetary policy actions, the MPC decided to keep the key policy rates unchange. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Chile,2007-02-08,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 8 February 2007 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). The external scenario relevant to the Chilean economy remains favorable. Global growth continues to be strong, while international financial conditions are still positive. The copper price has declined further, although at a more gradual pace than in recent months, while the oil price has shown a rebound. Both movements are consistent with the baseline scenario in the last Monetary Policy Report. Information available shows that domestic activity recovered some dynamism during the last quarter of last year, in line with estimates in the last Report. Salaried employment continues on the rise. Domestic financial conditions remain favorable, and the nominal yield curve has declined. Headline inflation evolved according to forecasts in the last Monetary Policy Report. Core measures CPIX and CPIX1 (that exclude fuels and perishables, and some regulated utilities, respectively), increased somewhat more than anticipated, although these increases do not warrant a change in the baseline scenario. Labor costs are still contained, and medium- and long-term inflation expectations remain anchored around 3%. The Board reaffirms its commitment of conducting monetary policy to assure that projected inflation will be at 3% over the policy horizon. Future changes in the monetary policy rate intended to achieve this objective will depend on incoming information and its implications on projected inflation. * The Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2007-02-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our previous decisions to raise interest rates. It has also confirmed that strong vigilance remains of the essence so as to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will permit medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area to remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. As emphasised on previous occasions, such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Our monetary policy remains accommodative, with the key ECB interest rates still at low levels, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity ample by all plausible measures. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. Turning first to the economic analysis, the latest indicators and survey data suggest that the economic expansion has continued into 2007 and remains solid and broad-based. Looking ahead, while some volatility in the quarter-on-quarter growth rates of real GDP cannot be excluded, the medium-term outlook for economic activity continues to be favourable. Conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to continue to expand at rates around potential. Global economic growth, which has become more balanced across regions, remains robust, providing support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is expected to maintain its momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, reflecting the benefits of an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption should also continue to gradually strengthen over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as labour market conditions  in particular employment growth  continue to improve. Risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. The main risks relate to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, it is essential to stress the importance of taking a medium-term perspective and to look through the possible volatility of inflation rates over the course of 2007. In this respect, it may be helpful to consider the potential volatility of inflation in greater detail. In the very short term, it appears that the changes in VAT in a large euro area country were not fully reflected in prices in January. Thereafter, it should be noted that on the basis of current prices for oil and oil futures and previous oil price developments, significant favourable base effects may progressively lead to lower inflation rates in the spring and summer. Later in 2007 inflation rates are expected to rise again as a result of unfavourable base effects. The medium to longer-term outlook for price stability remains subject to upside risks. They continue to include a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far. Furthermore, renewed increases in oil prices cannot be excluded. More fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments pose substantial upward risks to price stability, given the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters, the fact that survey measures of capacity utilisation are approaching the peak levels reached in 2000, and the ongoing improvement in labour market performance. It is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. In this context, wage agreements should take into account productivity developments while recognising the still high level of unemployment and price competitiveness positions. Indeed, the Governing Council will monitor the upcoming wage negotiations in the euro area countries very carefully. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Annual M3 growth rose further to 9.7% in December, marking the largest increase seen since the introduction of the euro. Of course, monthly figures can be volatile and we should not overemphasise short-term developments. However, continued strong money and credit growth confirm the view that the underlying rate of broad money expansion in the euro area remains vigorous, with no evidence as yet that the steady upward trend observed since mid-2004 has been halted or even reversed. The ongoing robust expansion of money and credit reflects the still accommodative monetary policy stance and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. At 10.7%, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector remained strong in December, although showing a slight moderation with respect to the previous month. Strong growth in private sector credit reflects the continuation of the upward trend in the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations seen since mid-2004. Meanwhile, in the context of rising mortgage rates throughout the euro area and slowing housing markets in some regions, the growth of household borrowing has shown some further signs of moderation in recent months, albeit remaining at still very high rates. Taking the appropriate medium to longer-term perspective for assessing trends in money and credit growth, the latest developments confirm the continuation of a persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion. Following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. Persistent strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, in assessing price trends it is particularly important to look through any short-term volatility. On the basis of today's assessment, after a possible fall over the spring and summer, inflation rates are likely to increase again later in the year. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to stronger than currently expected wage developments. Given the very strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. Hence, we will be strongly vigilant in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. As regards fiscal policy, first indications confirm that fiscal developments in the euro area were relatively favourable in 2006 on the back of strong output growth and revenue windfalls. It is now essential that the momentum of improving public finances is maintained and that the pace of fiscal consolidation accelerates in 2007 and 2008 so that all euro area countries attain their medium-term objective of a sound fiscal position as soon as possible. Better than expected budgetary outcomes in 2006 and possible further revenue windfalls this year should be used for faster fiscal consolidation. Experience has shown that the temptation to relax expenditure restraint, delay necessary reforms or pursue pro-cyclical policies in an upswing needs to be firmly resisted. Fiscal consolidation measures have the best chance of success when they are based on a credible and comprehensive reform strategy, with a focus on reducing expenditure rather than increasing revenue ratios. The Governing Council stressed that progress in the area of structural reforms and moderate increases in labour costs in some countries have been key factors in increasing employment and reducing unemployment over the last few years. Indeed, while still high at a rate of 7.5% in December 2006, the standardised unemployment rate was the lowest since the series began in 1993 and has fallen by 1.4 percentage points since its latest peak in June 2004. To fully exploit the beneficial effects of Economic and Monetary Union and the Single Market, further structural reforms must enhance the adjustment capacity of the euro area. This includes sufficient wage differentiation, especially to improve employment opportunities for less skilled workers and in regions with high unemployment. It also encompasses more flexible product and labour markets that would give rise to new investment possibilities and innovation. And it requires the removal of impediments to labour mobility  between jobs, between regions and across borders. Let me therefore recall that with Slovenia having entered the euro area, its labour force needs to be granted full access to the labour markets of all euro area countries. Generally, structural reforms, in combination with fiscal consolidation, must support sustainable developments by limiting the burden that is shifted to younger and future generations. Considerable challenges therefore remain, which differ across countries but which all urgently require determined action."
South Korea,2007-02-08,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). In the real economy, exports continue to show steady growth, facilities investment exhibits a growing pace and the recovery of construction investment has been maintained. On the other hand, private consumption exhibits a slowdown in the pace of its expansion. Meanwhile, the current account surplus has declined sharply, owing mainly to the narrowed goods account surplus. Consumer price inflation and core inflation both remain stable. The upward pace of real estate prices has slowed down. In the financial markets, financial institutions' lending has slowed the pace of its expansion. Nevertheless, overall liquidity conditions are favorable. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period."
Romania,2007-02-09,"In its meeting of February 9, 2007 the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for February 15, 2007, along with a 12-month calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues. The NBR Board analyzed the developments in the main macroeconomic indicators, in both domestic and international financial markets as well as their prospects in the context of Romania's integration in the European Union. Statistical data confirm the continuation of disinflation and the attainment of NBR's 2006 objective - with year-on-year inflation falling to 4.87 percent in December, below the 5.0 percent target. This achievement was the result of restrictive monetary and fiscal policies, combined with volatile food price deflation, a slowdown in the administered price dynamics and the appreciation of the leu. The most recent developments in macroeconomic indicators show the persistence of high dynamics of economic growth and productivity underpinned by investment and consumption expansion, the latter also triggering a widening of the current account deficit. Meanwhile, the increase in real monetary policy rate spread and the faster-than-anticipated appreciation of the leu, including as a result of stronger capital inflows amid favorable investor sentiment regarding emerging markets as well as in the context of Romania becoming an EU Member State, have led to tighter overall monetary conditions. Developments in foreign exchange and money markets over the recent months have highlighted liquidity and interest rate levels triggering a faster appreciation of the domestic currency, which contributes significantly to a slowdown in aggregate price growth. Money market rates have constantly been below the monetary policy rate so far, which calls for the adoption of measures to enhance the signaling role of the latter. Against this background, the NBR Board has decided to adjust its broad monetary conditions to the new context by lowering the monetary policy rate to 8.0 percent per annum from 8.75 percent, by pursuing an adequate control of liquidity via open-market operations in line with financial market conditions and by leaving unchanged the minimum reserve requirement ratios. Such a resetting of the level of monetary policy instruments is consistent with the aim to attain medium-term inflation targets in a sustainable manner and the need to ensure financial stability. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic context and inflation outlook, as well as the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. Even though the baseline scenario of the current projection shows a relative improvement of the medium-term inflation outlook, the risks associated with an increase in wages not being supported by sufficient progress in productivity and a possible easing of fiscal policy require the maintenance of a prudent monetary policy stance. The NBR Board will continue to vigilantly monitor monetary and macroeconomic developments, standing ready to adjust its instrument settings in order to ensure the maintenance of disinflation on the projected trajectory and consolidate European Union convergence, relying also on the support from other components of the macroeconomic policy mix. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for February 15, 2007, along with a 12-month calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues."
Peru,2007-02-15,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU PRESS RELEASE MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2007 BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 4.50% The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the reference interest rate for the interbank market at 4.50 percent, considering that no inflationary pressures are expected in the short term and that the factors that have driven the inflation rate below the target range are transitory. These include the lower prices of fuels, of public utilities and of some food products. The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.01 percent in January, as a result of which the last-12-month CPI inflation rate fell from 1.14 percent in December to 0.64 percent in January. On the other hand, the rate of core inflation was 0.1 percent, accumulating a last-12- month rate of 1.3 percent. The last-12-month inflation rate is expected to remain below the lower band of the inflation target (1.5 percent) in the first part of 2007 due to the reversal of the price rises of some food products observed in the first four months of 2006, in line with the forecasts outlined in the Inflation Report of September 2006 as well as with the recent communiques on the Monetary Program. The above-mentioned factors have a one-time impact on inflation and therefore require no particular monetary policy measures to address them. The evolution of prices takes place amid a context characterized by a dynamic performance of economic activity, whose growth estimated at 7.9 percent by end 2006 is considered to be the highest level of growth recorded in the last 11 years. This evolution is explained by the expansion of the productive capacity as a result of higher investment and productivity, the appreciation of the nuevo sol, and increased competition, reflected in lower margins and expectations of inflation. In this context, the Central Bank will continue to evaluate all relevant macroeconomic indicators and stands ready to take any necessary measures to ensure that inflation converges to the target range. Particularly, the Central Bank will oversee that an increased domestic spending that might exceed the improvements observed in terms of productivity is not translated into inflationary pressures. The average monthly interbank reference rate was 4.47 in January. The short-term rates are relatively stable. Thus, the 90-day corporate prime rate in soles in January was 5.20 percent, a level that was 3 basis points lower BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU than the one posted in December. On the other hand, the country risk indicator at end January was 131 bps., which represented an increase of 14 bps. with respect to the previous month. Furthermore, the yield on the 20- year sovereign bond in soles decreased at the close of month was 6.77 percent, increasing 19 bps. with respect to the close of December. In January, the nuevo sol appreciated 0.4 percent on average in nominal terms and depreciated 0.1 percent by the end of the period, thus closing the month at 3.198 per dollar. During the session, the Board of Directors approved the following annual interest rates for active and passive operations between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct temporary purchases of securities and rediscount operations: 5.25 percent. Overnight deposits: 3.75 percent. Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the following annual interest rates for operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage point. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.25 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 3.0 percent. The Board approved to initiate the procedures required to raise the maximum limit of investments abroad from 12.0 percent to 13.5 percent for Private Administrators of Pension Funds (Administradoras Privadas de Fondos de Pensiones). The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (for the month of March) on its session to be held on March 8, 2007."
Turkiye,2007-02-15,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep short- term interest rates (policy rates) unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 17.50 percent, and lending rate at 22.50 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m.  4:30 p.m. at 13.50 percent, lending rate at 25.50 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 21.50 percent. The Committee evaluates the recent data as broadly consistent with the outlook presented in the Inflation Report. The rise in inflation in January did not change the medium term inflation outlook as it can be attributed to developments in unprocessed food prices. Annual inflation may exhibit a downward movement in February due to a possible correction in unprocessed food prices and may have an upward movement in March owing to possible administered price hikes. Yet, the disinflation trend will become more discernible starting from the second quarter. While the slowdown in private consumption demand continues, external demand remains relatively strong. Aggregate demand conditions continue to support disinflation. Moreover, medium-term inflation expectations continue to improve. Nevertheless, the gap between expectations and the targets, the risks related to services price inflation, and uncertainties in the global economy necessitate keeping the tight policy stance. In light of these developments, the Committee assesses that meeting the medium term inflation targets requires the maintenance of the cautious policy stance. The Committee closely monitors the lagged effects of the monetary tightening since June 2006. Moreover, the potential impact of the progress in the structural reform agenda and the developments in incomes policy as well as public sector non-interest expenditures on inflation and inflation expectations are carefully evaluated. The Central Bank will not hesitate to tighten monetary policy in case of any new developments that would adversely affect the medium-term inflation outlook.

South Africa,2007-02-15,"Since the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee in December 2006, the outlook for inflation has on balance improved. Inflation outcomes, with respect to both consumer and producer prices, have been below expectations, mainly as a result of moderating food price inflation and lower international oil prices. Nevertheless, some longer-term risks to the outlook remain. There are still only tentative signs that consumer demand growth is abating. Credit extension has continued to grow at a robust rate. The challenge for monetary policy is to weigh up the perceived medium to long-term risks against the more favourable outlook. In the past few meetings, the MPC has consistently seen these risks to be firmly on the upside. Year-on-year inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds (CPIX) has remained constant at 5,0 per cent for the three months to December of 2006. In 2006 as a whole. CPIX inflation averaged 4,6 per cent compared to 3,9 per cent in 2005. In December, goods price inflation was unchanged from November at 5,2 per cent, while services price inflation increased to 4,8 per cent from 4,6 per cent in November driven mainly by higher rates of increase in housing services and medical services. Food price inflation, which has been a major driver of CPIX inflation over the past few months, has shown some signs of moderation. In December, food price inflation measured 7,7 per cent, compared to the peak of 9,4 per cent in October 2006. Meat prices, which remain the main contributor to food price inflation, increased by 16,6 per cent in December compared to rates of increase of just below 20 per cent in the previous two months. The petrol price increased at a year-on-year rate of 5,8 per cent in December, despite the R0,07 price decrease in that month. Prices of clothing and footwear fell by almost 12 per cent in December compared to the previous year. Production price inflation also shows signs that it may have peaked. Having measured 10,0 per cent in both October and November 2006, production price inflation declined to 9,3 per cent in December. Imported goods inflation measured 9,1 per cent compared to domestically produced goods inflation of 9,4 per cent. The contribution of food to production price inflation moderated in December which suggests that pressure on food prices at the consumer level could be further contained. The most recent central forecast of the Bank's forecasting model indicates an improvement in the inflation outlook compared to the forecast considered at the December meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. CPIX inflation is no longer expected to breach the upper end of the target, but is now expected to peak at an average rate of around 5,6 per cent in the second quarter of this year and to average 4,7 per cent by the fourth quarter of 2008. In terms of the model, the improved outlook is primarily the result of the change in the monetary policy stance last year and the improved outlook with regard to expected international oil price developments. There are a number of additional developments contributing to this positive outlook. There is some evidence of an improvement in market expectations of inflation since the last MPC meeting. The yield curve has inverted further, reflecting in part an improvement in inflation expectations. The break-even inflation rates as suggested by the yield differential between inflation-linked bonds and conventional government bonds indicate that inflation expectations have improved significantly since September when yields at shorter maturities exceeded 6 per cent. Since then, break-even inflation rates across all maturities have declined. Inflation expectations are also reflected to some extent in wage settlements in the economy. Recent nominal wage developments are indicative of inflation expectations remaining under control despite a slight upward trend. In the third quarter of 2006, unit labour costs increased at a year-on-year rate of 5,3 per cent, compared to a second quarter increase of 3 per cent. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, nominal wage settlements averaged 6,5 per cent in 2006 compared to 6,3 per cent in 2005. Although wage settlements were slightly higher in 2006, the inflation rate was higher than in the previous year. If allowance is made for a moderate increase in labour productivity, these increases are consistent with the inflation target. The domestic economy shows signs that the growth momentum has been maintained at rates around potential. Capacity utilisation levels remain high, particularly in construction and electricity generation, although they are below the peak reached in the second quarter of 2006. Growth in the mining and manufacturing sectors continued to display upward trends in 2006. Seasonally adjusted total mining production increased by 5,5 per cent in the three months ending December 2006, compared with the previous three months, while manufacturing sector output increased by 2,1 per cent over the same period. The positive trend in manufacturing is expected to be sustained as reflected in the Investec-BER Purchasing Managers Index which reached a level of 57,2 in January 2007. The exchange rate of the rand has been relatively stable and averaged R7,14 to the US dollar since the last MPC meeting when it was trading at around R7,10. During this period, it fluctuated in a range of between R6,93 and R7.40 to the US dollar. The rand is currently trading at around R7,20. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand is relatively unchanged since the last meeting. Much of the volatility observed since the previous meeting has been due to movements of the US dollar against other currencies, fluctuations in commodity prices and generally illiquid conditions in the local foreign exchange market at the end of the year. Balance of payments developments suggest that the deficit on the current account might have widened significantly in the fourth quarter of 2006 following an increase in the trade deficit. Preliminary estimates indicate that the deficit on the trade account of the balance of payments more than doubled from the third to the fourth quarter of 2006. In the fourth quarter, the value of merchandise imports increased by about 17 per cent from the third quarter, while the value of merchandise exports increased by about 8,5 per cent. Much of the import momentum in the fourth quarter, however, can be ascribed to the 140 per cent increase in the volume of oil imports compared to the third quarter. This inventory build-up appears to be exceptional and oil imports are unlikely to be sustained at these levels. We have emphasised on a number of occasions that the MPC does not have a target for the current account, nor does the MPC view deficits on the current account to be inflationary in themselves. The mandate of the Bank is to maintain inflation within the target range of 6 to 3 per cent. The risk to inflation arises if the market perceives a particular level of the current account to be unsustainable, which could have implications for the exchange rate and consequently for the inflation rate. To date the current account deficit, including that in the fourth quarter, has been adequately financed. Current developments appear to indicate that the current account deficit will continue to be adequately financed given the coherent macroeconomic policy framework of the country and positive growth prospects. Non-resident purchases of South African bonds and equities totaled R108 billion in 2006 as a whole, compared to R41 billion for 2005. This year to date, the non-residents have been net buyers of bonds and equities to the value of around R5,1 billion. Official gross gold and other foreign exchange reserves stood at US$25,9 billion at the end of December 2006 and the international liquidity position amounted to US$23,3 billion. Fiscal policy has remained supportive of monetary policy. International factors also provide a benign backdrop to the inflation outlook. Global growth prospects generally remain positive, with most regions expected to experience sustainable growth rates. The global interest rate cycle appears to have peaked in most regions, and world inflation is expected to remain under control. International oil price developments have impacted positively on inflation outcomes. The price of North Sea Brent crude oil, which was above US$62 per barrel at the time of the December meeting, reached a 20-month low of around US$51 per barrel in January following the unseasonably warm winter in the northern hemisphere. However a further reduction in output quotas by OPEC, effective from 1 February 2007, and colder weather in Europe and the US resulted in prices rising back towards US$60 per barrel. In the past few days the price of Brent crude has declined to around US$56 per barrel as fears of further OPEC cuts abated. Domestic petrol prices increased by R0.06 per litre in January, but were reduced by R0,23 cents per litre in February. This recent relative stability in the oil market has reduced the risk posed to inflation from this source. Nevertheless, given the tight supply and demand conditions in the market, oil prices remain vulnerable to geopolitical developments. As has been the case in the past few meetings, the central concern of the MPC was the continued strong pace of household consumption expenditure growth and its potential impact on inflation. It is recognised that there are lags in the adjustment to interest rate changes, and the question facing the Committee was the extent to which further reactions to interest rate changes can still be expected. This is a difficult judgement call to make in the light of the inevitable lags in data collection. Consumer demand, however, still appears to be growing robustly despite the 200 basis point increase in the repo rate last year. Real retail sales growth increased at a year-on-year rate of 12,3 per cent in November but moderated somewhat to 7,2 per cent in December. On a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis a decline of 2,1 per cent was recorded. It is still premature to tell whether this is the beginning of a new trend. There are also tentative signs that demand for motor vehicles may be declining. Household consumption expenditure has been underpinned by the continued asset price growth which has contributed to the sustained strength in household balance sheets. Share prices on the JSE Securities Exchange have continued to reach new highs. The All-share Index increased by 38 per cent during 2006, and since the last meeting of the MPC has increased by 9 per cent. House prices have also continued to increase at a brisk pace. According to the Absa house price index, house prices are still growing at year-on-year rates of almost 15 per cent. Twelve-month growth in banks' loans and advances extended to the private sector increased by almost 28 per cent in December, although the annualised quarterly growth showed some sign of moderation, declining from 28,6 per cent in the third quarter to 26,6 per cent in the fourth quarter. Mortgage advances grew at rates of around 30 per cent for much of 2006, while instalment sale credit and leasing finance recorded year-on-year growth of 15,8 per cent in December. These increases were despite further securitisation transactions on the part of the banks. Of significance is the fact that growth in total loans and advances to the corporate sector increased from 27,6 per cent in October to 31,8 per cent in December, whereas growth of credit extended to the household sector declined from 26,1 per cent in October to 24,3 per cent in December. On the basis of the foregoing analysis, the Monetary Policy Committee is satisfied that the inflation outlook has improved somewhat and expects inflation to remain within the target range for the forecast period. As the mandate of the Bank is to keep inflation within the inflation target range, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to leave the repo rate unchanged for now at 9 per cent per annum. However, risks to the inflation outlook remain and the MPC will continue to closely monitor developments with a view to adjusting the monetary policy stance as and when required."
Hungary,2007-02-26,"1 At its meeting on 26 February 2007, the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 8.00%. 2 In the February update of the Quarterly Report on Inflation, the central projection conditional on staff's assumptions is for inflation to fall significantly from 2007 H2, following the high outturns for CPI in the next few months. In the Monetary Council's judgement, inflation may slow significantly within the period relevant for monetary policy, i.e. in 2008, as a result of very subdued domestic demand and loose labour market conditions. The Bank's tight policy stance in recent months has also contributed to the current favourable outlook for inflation, which, in turn, is needed to be sustained to meet the medium-term target. However, the central projection is surrounded by considerable uncertainties. For the Council, the most important upward risk to inflation is potential rises in price and wage expectations. In this regard, the continued rise in private sector wage growth towards the end of 2006 is a cause for concern. However, the interpretation of information on wage developments may be made more difficult by two factors: wage data may be biased downwards temporarily following the tightening of labour market regulations; and the timing of irregular payments in the private sector may also have changed, due to rises in tax and contribution rates. In addition, special attention must be given to wage developments in the government sector. Another source of uncertainty is the impact on inflation of the slowdown in domestic demand, which may point to lower inflation over the period ahead. Taking into account the extent of the decline in demand expected for 20072008, there is considerable uncertainty about the scale of the slowdown and its effect on inflation. Overall, the Council's central view is that there remain significant risks to the outlook for inflation. Future developments in inflation expectations are perhaps the most important source of uncertainty. Consistent with its commitment to price stability, the Monetary Council will continue to pay particular attention to inflationary risks; and future developments in wages are of particular importance for the Council in this respect. The Council will aim to ensure that the expected higher rates of inflation in the coming months prove only temporary, and that they do not feed into inflation expectations."
Israel,2007-02-26,"26.2.2007</td> The Bank of Israel lowers the interest rate for March 2007 by 25 basis points to 4 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for March 2007 will be lowered by 25 basis points to 4 percent. This step is consistent with the policy of maintaining price stability, in accordance with the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined by 0.1 percent in January, in line with forecasters' expectations. Adjusting for seasonality, the CPI rose in January by 0.3 percent. In the last twelve months the CPI has risen by 0.1 percent, so that the rate of inflation over that period undershot the target. The strengthening of the shekel against the dollar constituted a major factor in the reduction of inflation to below the target range. Israeli forecasters' predictions of inflation for the next year are close to the midpoint of the target range, at about 1.8 percent. On average they estimate that the CPI will drop by 0.3 percent in February, and rise by 0.1 percent in March. Most private forecasters expect the interest rate for March to be reduced by 25 basis points, but the average of their assessments of the Bank of Israel interest one year hence is that it will be higher than the current rate, at 4.4 percent. Market expectations derived from the makam curve imply the assessment that in one year the interest ratewill be at a similar level to its current one. Data on economic activity indicate rapid growth. National Accounts figures published this month show that GDP rebounded in the fourth quarter of 2006 by 8 percent (annual rate), after falling by 0.7 percent in the third quarter as a result of the war in the north. In the whole of 2006 GDP grew atthe rate estimated previously, i.e., 5.1 percent. Business sector product expanded by 12.8 percent in 2006:Q 4, and by 6.3 percent over the year as a whole. The most recent indices suggest that activity might be increasing ata higher rate, with additional indications in the last month that the risein construction activity too is become more firmly based. The composite state-of-the-economy index rose by 0.9 percent in January, and the index for December was revised upwards from 0.6 percent to 0.7 percent. In addition, goods imports and exports continued to rise in January. There are indicators of greater difficulty in obtaining skilled workers, and the rate of unemployment among those with higher education is close to its low level of the mid-1990 s. The wage per employee post in the business sector rose by about 4 percent in January-November 2006 compared with the equivalent period in 2005. Till now, however, no signs of inflationary pressure from the labor market are evident, due to the rapid rise in productivity that reduced unit labor costs. It should be noted that the rate of reduction of unit labor costs is slowing. The shekel strengthened against the dollar in the last month from about NIS 4.25 to the dollar around the time of the last interest rate decision to about NIS 4.19 in the last few days. The shekel also strengthened slightly against the euro, from NIS 5.49 to the euro at the time of the last decision, to about NIS 5.47 in the last few days. In other words, the strengthening of the shekel mainly reflects the worldwide weakening of the dollar. The strength of the shekel in the foreign currency market during the last year is explained by the surplus in the current account, which in 2006 reachedabout 5 percent of GDP, and by the considerable inflow of nonresidents' investments to the economy. In the last month both real and nominal rates of interest continued to decline, with the 10-year CPI-indexed rate of interest dipping by 0.2 percentage points to 3.2 percent, and the nominalyield on 10-year unindexed bonds declining by 0.2 percentage points to 5.3 percent. The expected real interest rate one year forward declined in the last month from 3.6 percent to 2.9 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, declined a little in the international financial markets, from a level of 20 basis points last month to 18 basis points this month. The yield gap between fixed-rate 10-year Shahar local-currency bonds and 10-year USgovernment bonds narrowed from about 70 basis points at the time of the last interest rate decision to about 60 basis points in the days prior to thecurrent decision. In the international financial markets it is expected that the US Fed rate will remain at 5.25 percent until the second half of the year. After thereduction in the Bank of Israel rate for March, it will be 1.25 percentagepoints lower than the Fed rate. Last month the European Bank left the eurointerest rate unchanged, but the markets expect it to raise the rate next month by 25 basis points, with a further rise by the end of the year. Data of the budget performance for January show tax revenues in excess of expectation based on the seasonal path, and expenditure below the seasonal path. Tax revenues were 7.1 percent higher than in January 2006. The privatization of the Oil Refineries (Bazan) will contribute to the further reduction of the public-debt/GDP ratio in 2007. The main considerations behind the decision The reduction of the interest rate by 25 basis points is intended to increase the probability of returning inflation to within the target range in the course of 2007. It is expected that inflation, calculated over the previous 12 months, will revert to within the target range in the fourth quarter of the year.It is also expected that rapid growth in the year ahead, together with thecontraction of the output gap, will act to bring inflation back into the range. Interest rate reductions do not have an immediate effect on inflation. Since the reduction in the rate for November 2006, the monthly cuts in the Bank of Israel's interest rate total 1.5 percentage points. The interest rate decision is consistent with the Bank of Israel's policy of attempting to steer inflation back into the target range gradually, while maintaining price stability. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. 26.2.2007</td> The Bank of Israel lowers the interest rate for March 2007 by 25 basis points to 4 percent.

Malaysia,2007-02-26,"At its meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. The current level of the OPR is consistent with the medium term outlook for growth and inflation. Global and regional growth is expected to remain favourable in 2007. The Malaysian economy is expected to experience sustained growth, with stronger growth estimated for the second-half of the year. The growth would be mainly private sector driven, with the public sector having a strong supportive role. The expansion is expected to be more broad-based across all economic sectors. The outlook on inflation is relatively benign with average inflation expected to be significantly lower than in 2006. In addition, the lower international oil prices and moderating inflation in our trade partner economies are also expected to contribute to an environment of more stable domestic consumer prices.

Poland,2007-02-28,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 28 February 2007 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 27-28 February 2007 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 4.00% on an annual basis; lombard rate 5.50% on an annual basis; deposit rate 2.50% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.25% on an annual basis. Since the Council's meeting in January 2007 the inflation forecasts for 2007 have remained unchanged for the euro area, while the outlook for the United States have been slightly lowered. Similarly, the forecast of economic growth in 2007 in the euro area has stayed unchanged, while the forecast for the United States has been raised. In January the annual inflation in the euro area remained unchanged (at 1.9%), but it fell in the United States (from 2.5% y/y in December 2006 to 2.1%). Since the January meeting of the Council, current price of crude oil has risen by USD 2.9 (i.e. 5.3%), while the prices of this commodity forecast for 2007-2008 have edged down. GUS (CSO) data for January 2007 on industrial output, construction and assembly production and retail sales point to the continuation of strong economic activity. The rise in industrial output in January 2007 was markedly above the expectations of NBP analysts and external forecasters reaching 15.6% y/y (compared to 5.9% y/y in December), which in seasonally adjusted terms represents 15.5% y/y (compared to 10.5% in December). Also the surge in construction and assembly output proved considerably higher than expected, reaching 60.8% y/y (against 17.9% y/y in December), which in seasonally adjusted terms corresponds to 30.1% y/y (compared to 15.5% in December). This strong increase in the annual growth of construction and assembly output was supported by exceptionally favourable weather conditions in contrast to particularly adverse conditions a year before. January also brought an increase in retail sales growth (to 16.5% y/y in nominal terms, as compared with 13.3% y/y in December). Since the middle of 2005 growth in consumer loans has been running high (a rise of 22.5% y/y in January). The growth rate of housing loans is still increasing (to 58.3% y/y in January). The significant growth in loans to enterprises has also been sustained (at 13.3% y/y in January). The currently observed growth in corporate lending, combined with substantial own funds of enterprises resulting from their very good financial results in 2006, may indicate that the currently high investment growth will be sustained. Strong economic growth is accompanied by dynamically growing demand for labour. According to the BAEL (LFS), in 2006 Q4 the number of working persons rose by 3.6% y/y (compared to 3.9% in Q3), while the rate of unemployment slid to 12.2% (compared to 16.7% a year before). The rapid growth in the number of working persons and the concurrent decline in unemployment were accompanied by a dropping number of the economically active (a slide of 1.7% y/y in Q4), a trend noticeable since 2006 Q1. In January the employment in enterprises grew ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, by 3.8% y/y (compared to 4.1% y/y in December), while the unemployment rate according to labour offices' data amounted to 15.1% (compared to 18.0% one year before). Economic growth is also accompanied by a fast growth of wages. In 2006 Q4 the wages in the economy rose by 5.3% y/y in nominal terms (against a rise of 5.0% y/y in Q3). In January the growth in nominal wages in enterprises amounted to 7.8% y/y as compared to 8.5% y/y in December. The annual growth of wages in January was affected by shifts in one-off components of wages in some sections. According to the NBP's estimates, adjusting for the impact of these shifts, the rise in wages in January equalled 6.5% y/y compared to 6.2% y/y in December. The data on wages and number of persons working in the economy in 2006 Q4, in combination with the GDP growth as implied by the preliminary GUS data, indicate that Q4 saw a decline in the growth of unit labour cost in the economy (from 3.0% y/y in Q3, down to 2.4% y/y). In industrial enterprises, productivity is still growing faster than wages, which leads to a drop in unit labour costs in this sector (of 3.2% y/y in January). Strong economic growth which would not pose a threat to the achievement of the inflation target can only be sustained on the condition that the growth in wages does not outpace the growth in labour productivity. This requires strong and productivity-oriented corporate governance in enterprises, which is usually more easily attained in the conditions of private ownership. This also calls for wage discipline in the public sector. In January the annual growth of consumer prices increased to 1.7% (from 1.4% in December). In February the inflation expectations of households stood at 1.4% y/y (compared to 1.5% in January). In January the annual growth of producer prices in industry reached 2.9% compared to 2.6% in December (which represented a rise of 0.5% m/m against a drop of 0.5% m/m in December), while in manufacturing it was 2.1% (versus 1.5% in December). In January the nominal effective exchange rate of the zloty remained stable and was close to that recorded one year before. In the Council's assessment, in the short term CPI inflation will be considerably lower than in the January projection. The core “net” inflation may also prove markedly lower than in the projection. In the medium term the growth of wages may gradually increase, leading to higher inflation. The Council believes that this increase in inflation will be probably moderate provided that the strong productivity growth and low growth of external prices are sustained, the latter being associated with globalisation and the ensuing increased competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services. The Council judged that the current level of NBP interest rates makes it possible for inflation to be kept close to the target of 2.5% in the medium term. However, maintaining inflation close to target and thus creating conditions for sustainable long-term economic growth may require monetary policy tightening. Future decisions of the Council will depend, to a large extent, on whether rising economic activity proves more permanent. It will also depend on other economic developments in Poland and in the world and also on their impact on the inflation outlook in Poland. In the opinion of the Council, the currently observed strong economic growth creates convenient conditions for the implementation of reforms which would permanently reduce the public finance imbalance. The Council maintains its belief that it would be the most favourable for Poland to adopt an economic strategy focused on creating conditions that would guarantee the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date. The constraining of public finance imbalance would be conducive, both per se and by creating conditions for the introduction of the euro, to accelerating the long-term economic growth. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 27-28 March 2007."
Thailand,2007-02-28,"No 10 /2007 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 28 February 2007 Ms. Suchada Kirakul. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. Economic indicators in 2006 Q4 and January 2007 pointed towards a slowdown in domestic demand from the previous meeting, particularly in private consumption and investment. Economic momentum from exports was expected to moderate, given the prospects of the global economy in 2007. However inflationary pressures were expected to be on a downward trend and core inflation should remain within the target range. The MPC viewed that the risks to inflationary pressures were low and monetary policy could be eased in support of a further expansion of the economy. The MPC thus decided to lower the 1-day repurchase rate from 475 per cent per annum to 450 per cent per annum, effective today."
Philippines,2007-03-07,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The tiering system on bank placements with the BSP was also kept in place. The Monetary Board noted that the continued moderation in both headline and core inflation would support monetary easing. Reduced supply-side pressures (e.g., the dropping out in February of the base effects of RVAT on the CPI, the continued strengthening of the peso) and continued moderate improvements in demand conditions, are behind the abatement of underlying price pressures. Latest BSP forecasts suggest benign inflation for the rest of the year. On balance, however, the Monetary Board believes there continue to be important reasons to maintain the current monetary policy settings. Growth in domestic liquidity has strengthened further in recent months, and may persist given the prospect for sustained strong foreign exchange inflows. The strong growth in domestic liquidity has not triggered a rise in inflationary pressures, in part due to the growing absorptive capacity of the economy. Recent evidence indicates that bank lending has started to increase with the implementation of the tiering scheme."
Euroarea,2007-03-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Mr Steinbrück. President of the ECOFIN Council, and Commissioner Almunia. At today's meeting, we decided to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision was taken in view of the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. Today's decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards fostering sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. After today's increase, given the favourable economic environment, our monetary policy continues to be on the accommodative side, with the key ECB interest rates moderate, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. The Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Turning first to the economic analysis, according to Eurostat's first estimate, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of real GDP in the euro area for the fourth quarter of 2006 was 0.9%, which was above previous expectations. Our current assessment is that the quarterly profile of real GDP growth is likely to be somewhat smoother in response to the impact of indirect tax changes in one large euro area country than had originally been anticipated. The strength of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter is thus indicative of ongoing robust growth in the euro area. Both domestic demand and exports made significant contributions to real GDP growth, confirming the sustained and broad-based nature of the current expansion. The information on economic activity from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates supports the assessment that robust economic growth has continued into 2007. Looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic activity remains favourable. The conditions are in place for the euro area economy to grow solidly. As regards the external environment, global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat, remains robust, supported in part by lower oil prices. External conditions thus provide support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong corporate earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions continue to improve. This outlook is also reflected in the new ECB staff macroeconomic projections. The projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 2.1% and 2.9% in 2007 and between 1.9% and 2.9% in 2008. In comparison with the December Eurosystem staff projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2007 and 2008 have been revised upwards, largely reflecting the strength of GDP growth in the second half of 2006 and the lower energy prices, which, if sustained, would have a positive impact on real disposable income. In the Governing Council's view, the risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. The main risks relate to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, fears of a rise in protectionist pressures and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 1.8% in February 2007, unchanged from January 2007. The fall in headline inflation rates since the summer of 2006 has been predominantly due to lower energy prices. Looking ahead, last year's volatility in energy prices will lead to significant base effects, affecting the profile of annual inflation rates this year. On the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, annual inflation rates are likely to fall during the spring and summer before rising again towards the end of the year and then most likely hovering again at around 2%. The new ECB staff macroeconomic projections foresee annual HICP inflation averaging between 1.5% and 2.1% in 2007 and between 1.4% and 2.6% in 2008. Compared with the December 2006 Eurosystem staff projections, the upper bound of the range projected for inflation in 2007 is somewhat lower, largely reflecting the fall in oil prices. By contrast, the projected range for inflation in 2008 is slightly higher, largely on account of the anticipated stronger economic growth, which could exert more intense pressure on factor utilisation and factor costs. In this context, let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections, which are based on a series of technical assumptions, including market expectations for future short and long-term interest rates as well as for oil and non-energy commodity prices. At the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, the outlook for price developments remains, in the Governing Council's view, subject to upside risks. These relate to the possibility of renewed oil price increases and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. More fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments would pose significant upward risks to price stability, not least in view of the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters. It is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. In this context, wage agreements should take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies, as well as productivity developments. The Governing Council will monitor the upcoming wage negotiations in the euro area countries very carefully. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Annual M3 growth was unchanged at 9.8% in January, thus remaining at the highest rate observed since the introduction of the euro. At 10.6%, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also remained strong in January. Strong growth in private sector credit reflects the continuation of the upward trend in the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations seen since mid-2004. Meanwhile, in the context of rising mortgage rates throughout the euro area and a slowing increase in house prices in some regions, the growth of household borrowing has shown some further signs of moderation in recent months, albeit remaining at still high rates. Taking the appropriate medium to longer-term perspective for assessing trends in money and credit growth, the latest developments confirm the continuation of a persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion. Following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. The robust expansion of money and credit reflects the accommodative monetary policy stance over a prolonged period of time and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. In an environment of ample liquidity, it points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look through any short-term volatility in inflation rates. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to stronger than currently expected wage developments in a context of robust ongoing growth in employment and economic activity. Given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. The Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. As regards fiscal policy, there is growing confirmation that the favourable cyclical developments led to better than expected budgetary outcomes in 2006 in a number of countries and in the euro area as a whole. However, updated stability programmes foresee only moderate progress with fiscal consolidation in the coming years. In this respect, some countries' consolidation targets appear not fully in line with the requirements of the revised Stability and Growth Pact. Risks stem in particular from a lack of well-specified and credible measures, notably on the expenditure side of budgets. Given the favourable economic environment, the Governing Council considers it essential that pro-cyclical policies are avoided in all euro area countries and that sufficiently ambitious fiscal consolidation efforts are made in the countries with remaining budgetary imbalances and/or high public debt outstanding. The opportunity should be seized to attain sound public finances within the programme horizons and by 2010 at the latest in all euro area countries. Fiscal consolidation that is part of a medium-term-oriented, credible and expenditure-based reform strategy would support longer-term output and employment growth and help prepare for the fiscal impact of population ageing. As regards structural reforms, the European Council will discuss the current state of, and future progress in, the implementation of the Lisbon strategy at its meeting which starts today. It is positive to see that reforms and moderate increases in labour costs have helped to bring about higher employment and lower unemployment in recent years, although progress has been uneven across EU Member States. We encourage action to create incentives and structures which support the integration of all groups into the labour market, including those for which employment rates have been relatively low in the past. Reforms of tax and benefit systems should enhance incentives to work and to create jobs. Reducing labour taxes (including social security contributions) and thereby labour costs would support employment, while setting minimum wages at a level not in line with productivity reduces the employment chances of less skilled workers. We fully support policies to improve education and the adoption of technological innovations in order to raise productivity growth. Coupled with initiatives to create a business-friendly environment, such policies would broaden the opportunities of all to participate in an enhanced growth process."
South Korea,2007-03-08,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). In the real economy, exports continue to show steady growth, facilities and construction investment maintains a robust growing pace. On the other hand, private consumption exhibits a slowdown in the pace of its expansion. Meanwhile, the current account has recorded a deficit, owing mainly to the narrowed goods account surplus. Consumer price inflation and core inflation both remain stable. The upward pace of real estate prices has slowed down. In the financial markets, financial institutions' lending has slowed the pace of its expansion. Nevertheless, overall liquidity conditions are favorable. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period."
Chile,2007-03-15,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 15 March 2007 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). The external scenario relevant to the Chilean economy remains favorable, despite increased volatility and price adjustments observed in various assets in international financial markets. The latter has had mild consequences in the domestic financial market. Global growth continues to be strong, the copper price has strengthened reaching levels above estimates in the latest Monetary Policy Report's baseline scenario, and the oil price is somewhat above earlier projections. Information available is consistent with a gradual increase in internal output dynamism, in line with forecast in the last Report. Recently announced government measures support this scenario. Salaried employment continues to grow, although somewhat less intensely than in the past few months. Internal financial conditions look more favorable than they have in recent months. Beyond changes in the price level as a result of the implementation of Plan Transantiago, annual measures for CPI and CPIX (that excludes fuels and perishables) are evolving as forecast in the last Report. Meanwhile, annual CPIX1 inflation (which also excludes some regulated utilities and other goods), which has been above projections, has moderated over the last month. Alternative measures of trend inflation have shown mixed paths. Although labor costs are still contained and long-term inflation expectations remain anchored around 3%, some wage indicators show increased growth. The Board reaffirms its commitment of conducting monetary policy to ensure that projected inflation will be at 3% over the policy horizon. This implies that, in case inflationary risks decline and the baseline scenario in the last Monetary Policy Report consolidates, a somewhat stronger monetary impulse might be required. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2007-03-15,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2007 BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 4.50% The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the reference interest rate for the interbank market at 4.50 percent, considering that no inflationary pressures are expected in the short term and that the factors that have driven the inflation rate below the target range are transitory. These include the lower prices of public utilities and some food products. The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.26 percent in February, as a result of which the last-12-month CPI inflation rate fell from 0.64 percent in January to 0.36 percent in February. On the other hand, the rate of core inflation indicator of the trend of price increases was 0.26 percent, accumulating a last-12-month rate of 1.49 percent. The last-12-month inflation rate should remain below the lower band of the inflation target (1.0 percent) in the first part of 2007 due to the reversal of the price rises of some food products observed in the first months of 2006, in line with the forecasts outlined in the Inflation Report of January 2007. The above-mentioned factors have a one-time impact on inflation and therefore require no particular monetary policy measures to address them. This evolution of prices has taken place amid a context marked by a strongly dynamic performance of economic activity, which posted the highest level of growth (0.8 percent) observed in the last 11 years in 2006. This evolution is explained by the expansion of the productive capacity as a result of higher investment and productivity, the appreciation of the nuevo sol, low expectations of inflation, and increased competition reflected in lower margins. The macroeconomic prospects and the balance of risks described in our Inflation Report of January 2007 prevail. Thus, based on the expected pace of growth of economic activity, inflation expectations in line with the inflation target, and a moderate evolution of imported inflation, inflation is expected to converge to a rate of 2 percent. In contrast with the 2003-2005 period, the prices of food products and fuels are not expected to generate an upward trend of inflation in the forecast horizon, as normal conditions of supply are forecast in the agricultural sector and relatively moderate prices rises are expected in the international price of fuels. This upward trend in the forecast growth of economic activity for 2007 (6.8 percent) is being confirmed by the first indicators of demand this year, although no signals of inflation are observed yet. In this context, the Central BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Bank stands ready to prevent that an increase in domestic spending might be translated into inflationary pressures. The average monthly interbank reference rate was 4.48 in February. The short-term rates are relatively stable, while the long-term rates for operations in domestic currency continue to show a downward trend. Thus, the 90-day corporate prime rate in soles in February was 5.20 percent, a level that was 1 basis point higher than the one posted in January, while the yield on the 20-year sovereign bond in soles decreased at the close of month was 6.40 percent, decreasing 36 bps. with respect to end January. Emerging markets exhibited a higher volatility in the last week of February which involved portfolio adjustments in terms of the assets of these economies (currency, sovereign bonds, etc.). In this context, the country risk indicator was 136 bps. at the close of February, which represented an increase of 5 bps. relative to the previous month. In February, the nuevo sol appreciated 0.1 percent in nominal terms and closed at 3.191 per dollar at the end of the month. During the session, the Board of Directors approved the following annual interest rates for active and passive operations between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct temporary purchases of securities and rediscount operations: 5.25 percent. Overnight deposits: 3.75 percent. Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the following annual interest rates for operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage point. Swap: a commission equal to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.25 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 3.0 percent. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (for the month of April) on its session to be held on April 3, 2007."
Turkiye,2007-03-15,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep short-term interest rates (policy rates) unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 17.50 percent, and lending rate at 22.50 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m.  4:30 p.m. at 13.50 percent, lending rate at 25.50 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 21.50 percent.

While the slowdown in private consumption demand continues, foreign demand remains relatively strong. Aggregate demand conditions continue to support disinflation. Against this background, the disinflation trend is expected to become discernible starting from the second quarter of 2007. Nevertheless, prevailing uncertainties in the global economy, the gap between inflation expectations and the targets, and the risks related to services price inflation necessitate keeping the tight policy stance.

United States,2007-03-21,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. Recent indicators have been mixed and the adjustment in the housing sector is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters. Recent readings on core inflation have been somewhat elevated. Although inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures. In these circumstances, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.

Hungary,2007-03-26,"1 At its meeting on 26 March 2007, the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 8.00%. 2 In the Monetary Council's judgement, information received in the past month provides evidence that the Hungarian economy continues to grow along the central path assumed in the February issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation, and consequently, inflation may ease back close to the 3% medium-term target in 2008 H2. However, the latest data do not appear to have reduced the risks to the central projection. There was a fall in the market component of the consumer price index, and particularly in the month-on-month rate of core inflation, which may imply that considerable price pressures have not yet emerged in the Hungarian economy over and above the one-off upward impact on prices of the Government's measures. One source of uncertainty is that, although the January growth rate of regular pay in the private sector may pose an upside risk to the outlook for inflation, the detailed 2006 GDP data reflect a gradual easing in domestic demand. Pay growth in some sectors of the economy is inconsistent with the slowdown in productivity growth and the expected decline in demand. It is still difficult to make an accurate measure of wage inflation and its likely impact, as adjustment to the changes in labour market and tax regulations may bias statistical data upwards. According to the latest data, the fall in certain components of domestic demand within the overall pattern of growth was even more marked than in the past. On the demand side, this may have a dampening effect on inflation and reduce potential upward pressure caused by higher wage inflation. However, it may lead to a fall in firms' profitability, which, in turn, may add to the risk of a pronounced decline in economic growth and employment. The fall in the risk premium on forint-denominated government bonds over the recent period may also suggest an improvement in investors' sentiment about the long-term sustainability of the fiscal adjustment measures. This may provide increased room for manoeuvre in interest rate policy in the future. Taking all these factors into account, the Monetary Council decided to leave the Bank's key interest rate unchanged."
Israel,2007-03-26,"26.3.2007</td> The Bank of Israel interest rate remains unchanged for April 2007 at 4 percentThe Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for April 2007 will remain unchanged at 4 percent. This desicion is consistent with the policy of maintaining price stability, as expressed by the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions The Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell by 0.3 percent in February, in line with forecasters' expectations. Adjusting for seasonality, the CPI dropped in February by 0.4 percent. In the last twelve months the CPI has fallen by 0.8 percent, so that the rate of inflation over that period was significantly below the target. Israeli forecasters' predictions of inflation for the next twelve months are close to the midpoint of the target range, at about 2.3 percent, slightly higher than their forecast of 1.8 percent for the year 2007. Most private forecasters do not expect a change in the interest rate for April, and on average they assess that the interest rate in the next few monthswill be between 4 percent and 4.5 percent. Market expectations derived from the capital market indicate inflation of 1.4 percent over the next twelvemonths, while the makam curve implies the assessment that the interest rate will not change during the next year. Data on economic activity, based on the updated National Accounts figures for the fourth quarter of 2006, continue to indicate rapid growth. GDP rose by 5.1 percent, private consumption by 4.8 percent, gross fixed capital formation by 6.4 percent, and exports (excluding diamonds) by 9.3 percent. The decline in the unemployment rate to 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006, from 8.8 percent in the second quarter, also points to increased activity. At this stage, however, there are no signs of inflationary pressurederiving from the labor market, this is due to the rapid rise in productivity that resulted in a reduction in unit labor costs. In the light of thesefigures, the Bank of Israel updated its forecasts for 2007: GDP is now expected to grow by 5.1 percent, and business sector product by 6.2 percent. The shekel/dollar exchange rate remained essentially unchanged in the last month, and the shekel weakened by about 1 percent against the euro. The strength of the shekel in the foreign currency market in the last year can be explained by both the current account surplus, which in 2006 reached about 5 percent of GDP, and by the considerable inflow of nonresidents' investments into Israel. In the last month nominal long-term interest rates remained almost unchanged. On the stock exchange share prices fluctuated widely, against the background of the volatility of the major world stock exchanges. In the international financial markets. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, remained relatively low, at 18 basis points. The yield gap between fixed-rate 10-year Shahar local-currency bonds and 10-year US government bonds widened from about 60 basis points at the time of the last interest rate decision to about 80 basis points in the days prior to the current decision. In the international financial markets it is expected that the US Fed rate will be cut by 25 basis points by the end of the year. The Bank of Israel interest rate is currently 1.25 percentage points lower than the Fed rate. Last month the European Central Bank increased the euro interest rate, and the markets expect it to raise the rate by another 25 basis points by theend of the year. Data of the budget performance for January/February show tax revenues significantly in excess of expectation based on the seasonal path, and expenditure below the seasonal path. The main considerations behind the decision The decision not to change the interest rate is in line with the Bank ofIsrael's policy of aiming to return inflation to within the targetrange gradually, while maintaining financial stability. It is expected that during the next year rapid economic growth, in conjunction with the continued narrowing of the output gap, will act to bring inflation back into the target range. The marked drop in unemployment in the last quarter of 2006 strengthens the assessment that the narrowing of the output gap is proceeding faster than was thought previously. The cuts in the interest rate by the Bank of Israel each month since November 2006, totaling 1.5 percentage points, increase the probability that inflation will return to the target range in 2007. The effects of the large cumulative reduction in the rate have not yet been felt in full. In the light of the cuts in the interest rate in the last few months, and the steadying of inflation expectations one year forward at around the midpoint of the target range, the Bank's rate of interest in real terms has reachedthe low level of 2.6 percent, which has an expansionary effect on growth.</td> The domestic financial markets continue to show relative stability, despite the rise in the volatility of the international markets. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. 26.3.2007</td> The Bank of Israel interest rate remains unchanged for April 2007 at 4 percent.

Romania,2007-03-26,"In its meeting of March 26, 2007 the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR will vigilantly monitor developments in macroeconomic indicators and their outlook in order to ensure that monetary conditions are in line with the achievement of medium-term disinflation objectives and to consolidate the convergence process with the European Union, relying also on the support from other components of the macroeconomic policy mix. The analysis of recent macroeconomic and monetary developments shows that disinflation has stayed on a trajectory consistent with the announced inflation target for 2007, i.e. 4.0 percent ?1 percentage point. According to statistical data, year-on-year inflation rate slowed faster than forecast, to stand at 3.81 percent in February versus 4.01 percent in the previous month, 4.87 percent in December 2006 and 8.49 percent in February 2006. Average annual inflation rate also fell to 5.8 percent in February from 6.56 percent in December 2006 and 9.0 percent in February 2006. Statistical estimates point to a consolidation of the disinflation process which is projected to be reflected in a slowdown of the average annual inflation rate to 5.0 percent in the coming period. Economic growth - supported by a solid rise in investment and, to a lesser extent, by an advance in consumption - has remained fast at 7.7 percent, while the persistence of excess demand has triggered a wider current account deficit. The monetary sector shows a slower dynamic of non-government credit expansion (for the fifth consecutive month) against the background of a slowdown in the pace of increase for leu-denominated credits and some revival in foreign currency lending growth. The monetary policy stance, assessed via broad monetary conditions, has remained prudent in the context of the previous adjustment in the levels of monetary policy instruments, a faster leu appreciation in the recent period and the removal of some administrative measures limiting non-government credit dynamics. In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 7.5 percent per annum from 8.0 percent and to pursue an adequate control of liquidity via open-market operations in line with financial market conditions. The cut in the monetary policy rate to 7.5 percent also translates into a narrower gap between its level and the effective rate on sterilization operations, with the aim to improve monetary policy transmission, to enhance the signalling role of the monetary policy rate as the central bank's main monetary policy instrument and to better anchor inflation expectations, including the ones in the longer run. Although short-term outlook for inflation, including expectations, has improved, the risks posed by a potential relaxation in income and fiscal policies and by a steady widening of the current account deficit require the maintenance of a cautious monetary policy. In this context, the NBR Board has decided to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR will vigilantly monitor the developments in macroeconomic indicators and their outlook in order to ensure that monetary conditions are in line with the achievement of medium-term disinflation objectives and to consolidate the convergence process with the European Union, relying also on the support from other components of the macroeconomic policy mix. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for 2 May 2007, when a new quarterly."
Poland,2007-03-28,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 28 March 2007 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 27-28 March 2007 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 4.00% on an annual basis; lombard rate 5.50% on an annual basis; deposit rate 2.50% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.25% on an annual basis. Since the meeting of the Council in February 2007 the outlook for inflation in 2007 in the euro area has been slightly lowered. The forecasts for inflation in the United States have not changed. For the euro area the forecasts of economic growth in 2007 have been revised upwards, while they have remained unchanged for the United States. In February, the annual inflation in the euro-area was unchanged (at 1.8%), while in the United States it increased (to 2.4% from 2.1% in January). The current price of crude oil has gone up since the February meeting of the Council (by USD 3.2, i.e. 5.5%). The commodity's price forecast for 2007-2008 has edged up. GUS (CSO) data on industrial output, construction and assembly output and retail sales in January-February 2007 point to the continuation of economic growth acceleration in 2007 Q1. The rise in industrial output in February 2007 was consistent with the expectations of NBP analysts and external forecasters and amounted to 12.9% y/y (compared with 15.4% y/y in January), which in seasonally adjusted terms represented 13.0% y/y (compared with 15.5% in January). Construction and assembly output grew by 57.1% y/y (compared with 60.5% y/y in January) and in seasonally adjusted terms -- by 30.9% y/y (compared with 30.1% in January). Apart from the strong rise in demand, the annual growth of construction and assembly output continued to be supported by exceptionally favourable weather conditions in contrast to particularly adverse conditions a year before. In February the high growth in retail sales was also sustained (at 17.5% y/y in nominal terms as compared to 16.5% y/y in January). Since the middle of 2005 growth in consumer loans has been running high (a rise of 23.7% y/y in February). The growth rate of housing loans is still increasing (to 62.9% y/y in February). The significant growth in loans to enterprises has also been sustained (at 14.3% y/y in February). The currently observed growth in corporate lending, combined with substantial own funds of enterprises resulting from their very good financial results in 2006, may indicate that the currently high investment growth will be sustained. In 2006 net earnings of non-financial enterprises employing 50 and more people rose in relation to the corresponding period of the previous year by 35.8% reaching PLN 69.8 billion, while the net profit rate went up by 0.8 percentage point (to 4.7%). ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. The fast economic growth is accompanied by dynamically growing demand for labour. In February the employment in enterprises grew by 4.3% y/y (compared to 3.8% y/y in January), which was the highest increase since the beginning of the 1990s. According to the data from Labour Offices the unemployment rate fell in February to 14.9% (against 18.0% one year earlier). Economic growth is also accompanied by fast growing wages. In February the rise in nominal wages in enterprises was 6.4% y/y as compared to 7.8% y/y in January (6.5% y/y after adjusting for the impact of shifts in one-off components of wages in some sections). Strong economic growth which would not pose a threat to the achievement of the inflation target can only be sustained on the condition that the growth in wages does not outpace the growth in labour productivity. This requires strong and productivity-oriented corporate governance in enterprises, which is usually more easily attained in the conditions of private ownership. This also calls for wage discipline in the public sector. In February the annual growth rate of consumer prices rose to 1.9% (in comparison to the downward adjustment of 0.1 percentage point to 1.6% in January). ‘Net' core inflation stood at 1.6% y/y (against 1.5% y/y in January). In March inflation expectations of households rose to 1.7% y/y (from 1.4% in February). In February the annual growth of producer prices in industry reached 3.6% compared to 3.1% in January (0.3% m/m against 0.6% m/m in January), while in manufacturing it was 3.0% (versus 2.3% in January). In February the nominal effective exchange rate of the zloty remained stable and was close to that recorded one year before. In the Council's assessment in the short-term both CPI inflation and net core inflation will be markedly lower than in the January projection. In the medium term, the gradual increase in wage growth is likely to be sustained, which may lead to higher inflation. The Council believes that this increase in inflation will be probably moderate, provided that the strong productivity growth and low growth of external prices are sustained, the latter being associated with globalisation and the ensuing increased competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services. Maintaining inflation close to target of 2.5% and thus creating conditions for sustainable long-term economic growth may require monetary policy tightening in the near future. The scale of the tightening will depend, to a large extent, on whether the incoming data confirm the expectations that the high growth of domestic demand, which most probably outpaces the growth of potential GDP, will be sustained in the next few quarters. Future decisions will also depend on other economic developments in Poland and in the world and on their impact on future inflation in Poland. In the opinion of the Council, the currently observed high rate of economic growth creates convenient conditions for the implementation of reforms which would permanently contain the public finance imbalance. The Council maintains its belief that it would be the most favourable for Poland to adopt an economic strategy focused on creating conditions that would guarantee the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date. The constraining of public finance imbalance would be conducive, both per se and by creating conditions for the introduction of the euro, to accelerating the long-term economic growth. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 17 April 2007 and will be devoted to discussing the draft Inflation Report. The Report will be finally approved at the Council's meeting held on 24-25 April 2007."

Thailand,2007-04-11,"No 17 /2007 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 11 April 2007 Ms. Suchada Kirakul. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. In the first quarter of 2007, domestic demand slowed down by more than the MPC had expected, particularly private consumption and investment. The MPC assessed that the risks to economic growth this year rose due to the slowdown in the global economy which would dampen demand for exports, while weak private sector confidence would dampen domestic spending. As inflation in the first quarter moderated sharply, the MPC viewed that even though crude oil prices were expected to be higher, inflation would remain at a low level, due partly to subdued domestic demand. The MPC viewed that, with minimal inflationary pressures and with core inflation projected to remain within the target range for the next 8 quarters, monetary policy could be eased further and at an accelerated pace to support economic growth without increasing inflation risks. The MPC therefore decided to lower the 1-day repurchase rate by 05 per cent from 450 per cent per annum to 400 per cent per annum, effective today.

Chile,2007-04-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 12 April 2007 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). The external scenario relevant to the Chilean economy remains favorable. World growth is still high. The copper price has increased strongly and is now considerably above baseline projections in the last Monetary Policy Report. Prices of oil and derivatives, especially gasoline, have risen beyond projections. The prices of other commodities have also increased. Information available continues to reflect increased dynamism of domestic output, in line with forecasts in the last Report. Salaried employment continues on the rise and internal financial conditions have remained favorable. CPI inflation is somewhat below 3%, as projected. This is the result of changes in the price level due to the startup of Plan Transantiago, increased fuel prices with respect to January and core CPIX1 inflation (that excludes fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities) slightly above projections. The latter, partly influenced by the higher international price of some grains. Alternative measures of trend inflation show no material changes. Labor costs remain contained and inflation expectations are around 3%. Overall, the new information suggests that annual inflation will decline in the coming months with less intensity than was projected in the last Report. The Board reaffirms its commitment of conducting monetary policy to ensure that projected inflation will be at 3% over the policy horizon. Future changes to the MPR to attain this objective will depend on incoming information and its implications on projected inflation. * The Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2007-04-12,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in March. It has also confirmed that the medium-term outlook for price stability remains subject to upside risks, so that very close monitoring of all developments is warranted. Indeed, it is essential to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Given the favourable economic environment, our monetary policy continues to be on the accommodative side, with the key ECB interest rates moderate, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. Turning first to the economic analysis, recent information has underpinned our assessment of ongoing robust economic growth dynamics in the euro area. Eurostat's second estimate has confirmed quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2006 at 0.9%. Over the whole year 2006, real GDP grew by 2.7% in the euro area, unadjusted for the number of working days. On the basis of the latest data, survey releases and various indicator-based estimates, it appears that robust growth is continuing in the first half of 2007. Looking further ahead, the conditions are in place for the euro area economy to grow solidly. As regards the external environment, global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat, remains strong. External conditions thus continue to provide support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong corporate earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, increasingly supported by employment growth and improving labour market conditions. The risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. At longer horizons, downside risks remain, stemming mainly from the external side. They relate to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of further increases in oil prices and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 1.9% in March 2007, compared with 1.8% in the first two months of the year. A detailed breakdown of the March HICP data is not yet available. Looking ahead, barring further increases in oil prices, last year's volatility in energy prices will lead to significant base effects, thereby affecting the profile of annual inflation rates this year. On the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, annual inflation rates are likely to fall in the months to come, before rising towards the end of the year to hover again at around 2%. Over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, the outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks. These relate to the possibility of further oil price rises and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. More fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments could pose significant upward risks to price stability, not least in view of the favourable momentum in labour markets observed over the past few quarters. It is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. In this context, wage agreements should take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies, as well as productivity developments. The Governing Council monitors the wage negotiations in euro area countries with particular attention. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Annual M3 growth increased further to 10.0% in February, from 9.9% in January. At the same time, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, while remaining very strong at 10.3% in February, showed some further signs of moderation. Whereas in previous months this moderation reflected a decline in the growth rate of household borrowing in an environment of rising mortgage lending rates throughout the euro area and a slowing increase in house prices in some regions, in February it was due to a moderation in the growth of loans to non-financial corporations. When assessing such developments, it should be borne in mind that monthly figures can be influenced by temporary factors and should thus not be overstated. Indeed, the strong growth in private sector credit reflects the continuation of the strong trend in the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations seen since mid-2004. When put in perspective, the latest data continue to point to vigorous dynamics in the underlying rate of broad money expansion in the euro area. The continued robust expansion of money and credit reflects the low levels of interest rates over a prolonged period of time and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. Rising short-term interest rates, in combination with low long-term interest rates, have had an impact on developments in the individual components of monetary and credit aggregates, but have thus far had only a limited influence on the overall strength of monetary developments. Following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. In this environment of ample liquidity, the continued vigorous expansion of money and credit points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look through any short-term volatility in inflation rates. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to stronger than currently expected wage developments in a context of ongoing robust growth in employment and economic activity. Given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments. Indeed, it is essential to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. Concerning other policy areas, the Governing Council welcomed the recommendations addressed to the euro area countries in the 2007 update of the Integrated Guidelines, which was endorsed by the European Council at its meeting on 8 and 9 March, particularly to speed up fiscal consolidation, to improve the quality of public finances, to foster competition and integration, and to promote labour market reforms. Indeed, as regards fiscal policy, it is of the utmost importance to use the momentum of the improved economic situation and to press ahead vigorously with budgetary consolidation. Government deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios in euro area countries in 2006 have turned out to be significantly better than anticipated. But this positive outcome largely reflects buoyant tax revenues in the context of a favourable macroeconomic environment, offsetting in some cases higher than planned public expenditure. The better than expected fiscal outcomes in 2006 should lead to more ambitious targets for 2007 and beyond, allowing revenue windfalls to be fully allocated to deficit and debt reduction. Furthermore, procyclical fiscal policies should be avoided in all countries. This is of vital importance to ensure fiscal sustainability in preparation for the impact of ageing populations and is fully in line with the revised Stability and Growth Pact. Reviewing public expenditure and taxation so as to improve the quality of public finances would additionally foster economic growth and fiscal sustainability. We also support ambitious structural reforms, which would further contribute to the smooth functioning of Monetary Union and support growth potential and job creation. In particular, improving labour market flexibility to better align wage and productivity developments and facilitating labour mobility would further strengthen the resilience of countries to shocks and ensure their competitiveness."
South Korea,2007-04-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). In the real economy, while exports continue to show steady growth, facilities and construction investment maintains a robust growing pace and private consumption appears to be recovering. Meanwhile, the current account has recorded a surplus, thanks to the widened goods account surplus. Consumer price inflation and core inflation both remain stable. The upward pace of real estate prices has slowed down. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions' lending has shown a steady increase led by those to small and medium enterprises. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period."
South Africa,2007-04-12,"Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee in February 2007, the inflation outlook has deteriorated somewhat, despite the most recent inflation outcomes. The less favourable outlook has been brought about primarily by petrol and food price increases. Domestic demand pressures and credit extension have remained strong with only tentative signs of moderation in response to the tighter monetary policy stance. At the same time, the South African economy has been growing at a robust pace and employment growth has also been encouraging. Domestic growth prospects remain positive despite the temporary sell-off in the international markets in late February. The appetite for emerging market assets has rebounded. Year-on-year inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds (CPIX) increased at a year-on-year rate of 5,3 per cent in January 2007, following a rate of increase of 5,0 per cent in the previous three months. In February, year-on-year CPIX inflation declined to 4,9 per cent. Food and energy remained the main drivers of inflation. If these categories were excluded. CPIX inflation would have measured 3,9 per cent and 4,0 per cent in January and February respectively. Food prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 7,7 per cent in February this year, following an 8,1 per cent increase in January. Meat price inflation, which was the largest contributor to overall CPIX inflation, declined from 16,0 per cent in January to 13,9 per cent in February. The elevated spot prices of maize and wheat resulted in grain product prices accelerating at a rate of 8,7 per cent in February, compared to 7,1 per cent in January. Petrol price changes over the past few months have been a reflection of the volatility in international oil prices and the exchange rate. In February 2007, year-on-year petrol price inflation measured 1,8 per cent compared to 8,2 per cent the previous month. This is nevertheless significantly lower than the increases in excess of 20 per cent that were experienced in the middle of last year. In contrast, the prices of a number of goods continued to decline in February. Clothing prices declined by 7,8 per cent, footwear prices by 11,0 per cent and those of furniture by 2,8 per cent. In January and February 2007, goods price inflation measured 5,7 per cent and 5,0 per cent respectively, compared to services price inflation of 4,6 per cent and 4,8 per cent in the same months. Administered prices increased by 6,4 per cent and 4,1 per cent in January and February respectively while administered prices excluding petrol increased at a year-on-year rate of 5,7 in those months, compared to 3,1 per cent in June 2006. Production price inflation continued to increase at high rates, across a broad range of categories, although below the peak of 10,0 per cent seen in October and November 2006. Measured year-on-year, production price inflation declined to 9,5 per cent in February, compared to 9,8 per cent in January. Imported goods inflation measured 9,7 per cent in February compared to domestically produced goods inflation of 9,4 per cent. The most recent central forecast of the Bank's forecasting model indicates a deterioration in the inflation outlook, mainly as a result of adverse developments in the international oil markets and administered prices. The forecast, which takes account of the petrol price increases of March and April, projects that CPIX inflation will increase to slightly below the upper level of the inflation target in the second quarter of 2007. Thereafter, apart from a technical decline in the third quarter. CPIX inflation is expected to remain at rates of around 5,9 per cent until the second quarter of 2008 and then follow a downward trajectory to reach 5 per cent by the final quarter of that year. The latest survey of inflation expectations conducted on behalf of the Bank by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at the University of Stellenbosch indicates that CPIX inflation expectations in respect of both 2007 and 2008 have declined compared to the previous survey. This may indicate that inflation expectations are not always backward looking, and have remained entrenched within the inflation target range. Inflation expectations declined from 5,4 per cent to 5,2 per cent for 2007, and from 5,4 per cent to 5,1 per cent for 2008, while CPIX inflation is expected to average 5,1 per cent in 2009. All categories of respondents lowered their expectations for 2007, while business executives and trade union officials lowered their expectations for 2008. As usual, the MPC analysed the factors impacting on inflation and assessed the risks to the forecast. In some instances, these risks were perceived to have increased, whereas in other cases there has been no major change to our previous assessment. In particular, the risks posed by oil and food prices appear to have increased. International oil price developments have been dominated by heightened geopolitical tensions, supply disruptions and declining inventory levels. The price of North Sea Brent crude oil increased to around US$70 per barrel in recent weeks, compared to a level of around US$56 per barrel at the time of the February MPC meeting. As a result, the domestic petrol price increased by R0,24 per litre in March, and R0,68 per litre in April. A decomposition of the April price increase shows that of the R0,68 increase in April, about R0,09 was attributable to exchange rate changes. R0,10 to fuel taxes announced in the February budget, and the remainder to changes in the international price of oil. International oil prices are expected to remain vulnerable to geopolitical developments and therefore continue to pose a significant risk to the outlook. The spot prices of white and yellow maize have increased significantly over the past two years as a result of domestic drought conditions and increases in international prices. Grain product prices, which have a weight of 4,8 per cent in CPIX, are expected to increase further as they have not yet fully reflected these increases. The higher maize prices have also affected meat prices through their impact on cattle and chicken feed prices. However, meat price inflation could be moderated somewhat as more cattle are brought to market during periods of drought. This effect, while possibly significant, is expected to be relatively short-lived. Despite the tighter monetary stance since June last year, household consumption expenditure growth, which measured almost 8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2006, continues to pose a risk to inflation. In January of this year, retail sales increased at a year-on-year rate of 9,4 per cent compared to 6,7 per cent in December 2006. There is, however, some evidence of moderation in the growth of interest sensitive durable goods consumption. In particular, a softening trend in motor vehicle sales has been observed in recent months. The seasonally adjusted number of new vehicles sold in the first quarter of 2007 declined by 2,9 per cent compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Consumer confidence remains at a high level. According to the latest FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index (CCI), the CCI increased significantly during the first quarter of 2007, to reach the highest level ever recorded in the 25-year existence of the index. Factors underpinning the strong demand include the further increases in asset prices. The housing market remains buoyant and the JSE Securities Exchange has reached new highs despite the short-lived downturn in March. Credit extension by banks to the private sector has continued at uncomfortably high levels. Twelve-month growth in banks' loans and advances extended to the private sector has grown at a rate of around 27 per cent since November 2006, and increased to 27,7 per cent in February this year. Asset-backed credit growth however showed a modest decline in February to 25,5 per cent. Instalment sale and leasing finance growth declined from 15,8 per cent in December to 14 per cent in February, reflecting the moderation in demand for motor vehicles. Growth in total loans and advances to households has been on a somewhat declining trend compared to the strong upward trend in credit extension to the corporate sector. Nevertheless, the ratio of household debt to disposable income increased further in the fourth quarter of 2006 to almost 74 per cent and the cost of servicing the debt has been steadily increasing. The South African economy has grown at a rate of 5 per cent in each of the past three years, a level which we estimate to be slightly above potential. Indications are that growth rates around this level are likely to be sustained during 2007. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector increased further in the fourth quarter to a new level of 86,6. The Investec Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) reflects continued buoyant conditions in the manufacturing sector, and despite a marginal decline in the RMB Business Confidence Indicator, business confidence remains high and broad-based. Underpinning this positive outlook is a strong trend in the growth of investment expenditure. Gross fixed capital formation increased at an annualised rate of 16,6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2006, and 12,8 per cent for the year. As a ratio to GDP, gross fixed capital formation has increased from around 15 per cent in the early part of the decade to over 19 per cent in the final quarter of 2006. While this bodes well for current and future growth, the concurrent decline in the savings ratio has seen the current account deficit of the balance of payments widening to 6,4 per cent of GDP in 2006, and 7,8 per cent of GDP in the final quarter of the year. The good growth prospects for the economy continued to ensure that the current account deficit has been adequately financed. Since the beginning of this year, net non-resident purchases of bonds and equities have totaled R20,3 billion. The Bank has also been able to continue with its gradual build-up of international reserves. Official gross gold and other foreign exchange reserves stood at US$26,5 billion at the end of March 2007 and the international liquidity position amounted to US$24,0 billion. Since the February meeting of the MPC, the exchange rate has been relatively stable, apart from the reaction to the transitory sell-off in international financial markets in late February. The exchange rate reached a level of R7,55 to the US dollar in response to the heightened risk in the markets, but by late March the rand had returned to levels below R7,30. The rand is currently trading at around R7,15 to the US dollar, compared to R7,20 at the previous meeting. The trade-weighted rand exchange rate is also relatively stable compared to February. Other factors impacting on the exchange rate during this period included movements in the US dollar against other currencies and commodity price fluctuations. The outlook for global growth appears to be positive, despite the recent market volatility. The re-rating of risk, particularly in emerging markets, resulted in significant adjustments in exchange rates and stock market valuations globally. Most markets have since recovered to a large extent, including those in South Africa. Strong growth in most regions is expected to be sustained, although there is the risk of a slowdown in the United States. The continued resilience of the world economy also bodes well for commodity prices. Global inflation is expected to remain under control despite the firmer oil prices, and the international interest rate cycle appears to have peaked. However, monetary policies are unlikely to become generally more accommodating in the short term in the face of the positive growth outlook. The Monetary Policy Committee has decided that despite the slight deterioration in the inflation outlook, an unchanged monetary policy stance continues to be appropriate for now. The repo rate will therefore remain at 9 per cent per annum."
Peru,2007-04-15,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2007 BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 4.50% The Board of the Central Bank (BCRP) approved to maintain the reference interest rate for the interbank market at 4.50 percent. However, the Board expressed concerns about the possible inflationary impact that a growth of domestic demand exceeding the rates forecast by the Bank might have in a 12-18 time horizon. Therefore, should this trend persist, the Board would be inclined to withdraw monetary stimulus when deemed appropriate and on a timely basis. The Board analyzed recent macroeconomic developments and prospects on the basis of information for the last month, including the following: The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.35 percent in March, as a result of which the last-12-month CPI inflation rate fell from 0.36 percent in February to 0.25 percent in March and would be likely to come closer to zero in April, in line with the forecasts included in our Inflation Report of January 2007. On the other hand, the rate of core inflation indicator of the trend of price increases was 0.33 percent, accumulating a last-12-month rate of 1.42 percent (1.49 percent in February). The last-12-month inflation rate should remain transitorily below the lower band of the inflation target (1.0 percent) in the first part of 2007, due to both the reversal of the price rises of some food products observed in the first months of 2006 and the lower prices of fuels and public utility rates observed in the last months of 2006. Domestic demand grew from 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 to an estimated rate of 13.5 percent in January-February 2007, driven by the growth of private consumption (6.9 percent) and private investment (23.4 percent). The Board expressed concern about the high growth of domestic demand and, in this context, stands ready to anticipate an eventual impact on prices that could be caused by an increased expansion of domestic spending and to withdraw monetary stimulus. The average monthly interbank reference rate was 4.50 in March. The short-term rates are relatively stable, while the long-term rates for operations in domestic currency continue to show a downward trend. Thus, the 90-day corporate prime rate in soles in March was 5.18 percent, a level that was 2 basis point lower than the one posted in February, while the yield on the 20-year sovereign bond in soles at BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU end March was 6.35 percent, decreasing 5 bps. relative to end February. The General Index at the Lima Stock Exchange grew 13.2 in March. On the other hand, in February, last-12-month credit to the private sector grew 16.8 percent, while credit to the private sector in domestic currency grew 30.3 percent. In March, on average the nuevo sol appreciated 0.1 percent in nominal terms and closed at 3.184 per dollar at the end of the month. This evolution was mainly associated with a dollar supply of US$ 666 million in the exchange market (spot operations), partly explained by the fact that the period for paying income tax started. In this context, the Central Bank purchased US$ 610 million in the exchange market to reduce the volatility of exchange and accumulate international reserves. During the session, the Board of Directors approved the following annual interest rates for active and passive operations between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct temporary purchases of securities and rediscount operations: 5.25 percent. Overnight deposits: 3.75 percent. Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the following annual interest rates for operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage point. Swap: a commission equal to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.25 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 3.0 percent. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (for the month of May) on its session to be held on May 3, 2007."
Philippines,2007-04-18,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The tiering system on bank placements with the BSP was also retained. In its assessment of the monetary policy stance, the Monetary Board noted that recent price developments are consistent with the BSP's and the market's expectations of a generally benign inflation outlook. Supply-side pressures continued to ease in recent months given stable food prices, improved weather conditions, and the strengthening peso. The lagged impact of the monetary tightening in 2005 contributed to the slowdown in inflation. At the same time, demand-side pressures remained manageable. However, risks to the inflation outlook remain. Growth in domestic liquidity has been strong and this could persist given the prospect for sustained foreign exchange inflows. In addition, renewed volatility in oil prices continue to be an upside risk to future inflation given the still-limited global production capacities and possible geopolitical disturbances. While liquidity is not a concern at present, the Monetary Board believed that strong monetary growth could build up inflationary pressures over the medium term. To address this potential risk, the Monetary Board approved new monetary measures as follows:. These measures will take effect on 10 May 2007. The Monetary Board will continue to monitor closely the evolving monetary conditions in order to safeguard price stability and provide the macroeconomic environment supportive of a sustainable economic growth."
Turkiye,2007-04-18,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep short- term interest rates (policy rates) unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 17.50 percent, and lending rate at 22.50 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m.  4:30 p.m. at 13.50 percent, lending rate at 25.50 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 21.50 percent. The Committee evaluates the recent data on economic activity as broadly consistent with the outlook presented in the January Inflation Report. While the slowdown in private consumption demand continues, foreign demand remains relatively strong. Aggregate demand conditions continue to support disinflation. Against this background, the disinflation trend is expected to become discernible starting from the second quarter of 2007. Nevertheless, the Committee decided to enhance the cautious policy stance against the risks such as the gap between inflation expectations and targets, the backward looking pricing behavior, increase in oil prices, prevailing uncertainties, and the stickiness related to services price inflation. The monetary tightening since June 2006 is affecting the domestic demand as expected. The lagged effects on inflation are yet to be seen. The potential impacts of the progress in the structural reform agenda and the developments in incomes policy as well as public sector non-interest expenditures on inflation and inflation expectations are carefully evaluated. Within this framework, the Committee assesses that meeting the medium term inflation targets requires the maintenance of the tight policy stance. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook will lead the Committee to reconsider its stance.

Israel,2007-04-22,"22.4.2007</td> The Bank of Israel interest rate for May 2007 cut by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for May 2007 will becut by 25 basis points, to 3.75 percent. This step is consistent with the policy of maintaining price stability, as expressed by the inflation targetof 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.2 percent in March, in line with forecasters' expectations. Seasonally adjusted, the CPI also roseby 0.2 percent. In the last twelve months the CPI has fallen by 0.9 percent, so that the rate of inflation over that period is still significantly below the target. Israeli forecasters' predictions of inflation for 2007 and for the next twelve months are both below the midpoint of the target range, at 1.2 percent and 1.4 percent respectively. Their forecasts for 2008, however,at 1.9 percent, are close to the midpoint. Most private forecasters expectcuts of 25 basis points each in the interest rates for May and June, and on average they assess that the interest rate at the end of 2007 and twelve months hence, in April 2008, will be 4 percent. The expectation of inflation over the next 12 months, derived from the capital markets, is 0.5 percent, while the makam curve implies that the interest rate will decline slightly during the next year. On the real side, data received since the last interest rate decision on 26 March 2007 give additional support to the assessment that rapid growth is continuing. Thus, the composite State-of-the-Economy index for March rose by 0.6 percent, while the revised indices for January and February were readjusted upward by a total 0.5 of a percentage point. Also, the number of employee posts increased over the last twelve months by 4.4 percent (calculated from the average for November 2006 to January 2007 compared with the same period a year earlier). Employment service data indicate a downward trend in the number of job hunters and an increase in the demand for workers. The nominal wage per employee post increased by about 3.1 percent in the last twelve months. The number of tourist hotel bed nights rose in February, indicating continued recovery in the tourist industry. Tax revenues in the first quarter of 2007 exceeded the seasonal path of the budget, and expenditure was below its seasonal path. The shekel exchange rate against the dollar declined since the previous interest rate decision at the end of March until mid-April by about 3.7 percent. Most of this appreciation of the shekel was due to the dollar's weakening in the international markets, and also to Israel's large current account surplus and the inflow of investments from abroad. In April nominal yields to maturity fell, and reached their lowest ever level,about 5 percent for the medium and long terms. In contrast, real medium- and long-term yields remained unchanged at about 3 percent. Share prices rose from the middle of March; the general share price index increased by 7 percent, and the Maof (Tel Aviv 25) index by 10 percent. In the international financial markets. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, remained low, at 18 basispoints. The yield gap between fixed-rate 10-year Shahar local-currency bonds and 10-year US government bonds contracted to its lowest ever level, 40 basis points. In the international financial markets it is expected that the US Fed funds rate will be cut by 25 basis points by the end of the year. The Bank ofIsrael interest rate for May is 1.5 percentage points lower than the Fed funds rate. The markets expect the European Central Bank to raise the euro interest rate by 25 basis points by the end of the second quarter of 2007, and that there will be a further rise by the end of the year. The main considerations behind the decision The main consideration in the previous interest rate decision, on 26 March 2007, was the rapid economic growth rate, with the implied narrowing of the output gap; the decision also reflected the Bank of Israel's commitment to maintaining financial stability. Rapid growth has persisted, and continues to help return inflation to within the target range. According to Bank of Israel assessments, domestic prices--that are not directly affected bychanges in the exchange rate--are rising by more than 2 percent per annum. At the same time, since the last interest rate decision, estimates of future inflation--derived from the capital markets forecasters' predictions, and the Bank of Israel econometric models--have declined. This decline reflects mainly the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar (primarily due to the weakening of the dollar worldwide), which contributes to reductions in domestic prices. The decision to reduce the interest rate for May by 25 basis points was taken in the context of the Bank of Israel's policy of continually attempting toreturn inflation gradually to within the target range by the end of the year, while maintaining financial stability. This policy provides the backdrop to the cuts in the interest rate since November 2006 totaling 1.75 percentage points. This current decision is part of the gradual process that will continue as long as necessary to increase the probability that inflation will return to the target range close to the end of 2007. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. Please note: The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decisionwill be published on 7 May 2007. The decision regarding the interest rate for June will be published at 18:30 on 28 May 2007. 22.4.2007</td> The Bank of Israel interest rate for May 2007 cut by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent.

Poland,2007-04-25,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 25 April 2007 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 24-25 April 2007 The Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point to the level: (cid:131) reference rate 4.25 % on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 5.75 % on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 2.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 4.50% on an annual basis. The Polish economy is currently in the period of strong growth involving all economic sectors. The data released in April support previous assessments that strong economic activity should be sustained for at least next few quarters. The continuation of fast economic growth in Poland will be supported by strong activity in the world economy and particularly the continuation of the fast economic growth in the euro area in the conditions of stable inflation. In March the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland amounted to 2.5%, which is a level consistent with the inflation target of the NBP. The Council got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by NBP staff and based on the ECMOD model, which is one of the inputs to the Council's decision-making process on NBP interest rates. According to the April ECMOD-based projection, the annual GDP growth will remain with 50-percent probability within the range of 6.0-7.0% in 2007 (compared with 4.9-6.7% in the January projection), 4.0-6.3% in 2008 (compared with 3.6-6.4%) and 4.0-7.0% in 2009 (compared with 3.5-6.5%). According to the April inflation projection, the growth of consumer prices will be lower than in the January projection over the whole projection horizon. Under constant interest rates, there is a 50-percent probability that inflation will remain within the range of 1.3-2.6% in 2007 Q4 (compared with 2.1-3.8% in the January projection), 1.6-3.8% in 2008 Q4 (compared with 2.2-4.5%) and 2.1- 4.6% in 2009 Q4 (compared with 2.4-5.2%). The Council also got acquainted with other forecasts conducted at the NBP. In the Council's assessment, in the second half of 2007 CPI inflation will temporarily decrease markedly below the inflation target of 2.5%, which is also indicated by the April inflation projection. In the Council's assessment, in the medium term, the probability of inflation running above the target is larger than the probability of its running below the target, which persuaded the Council to tighten the monetary policy. The Council assessed that the high growth of domestic demand, which most probably outpaces the growth of potential GDP, will be sustained in the next quarters, which should be conducive to a gradual increase in wage and inflationary pressures. ul.

Malaysia,2007-04-27,"At its meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. Domestic consumption and investment indicators continue to support a steady growth path for domestic demand. More moderate growth in the U.S., however, is expected to lead to some moderation in export growth during the first half of the year, although this is expected to be partially mitigated by sustained growth in other trading partner economies. While this external environment may result in slower growth in the first half of the year, for the year as a whole, the Malaysian economy is expected to experience sustained growth. The growth would be driven mainly by domestic demand, fuelled by private sector consumption and investment, with the public sector playing a strong supportive role. On the inflation outlook, there continues to be a lack of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy. Consequently, as the effect of the increase in retail petroleum prices lapses, inflation has moderated to 1.5% in March. The expectation going forward is that the average rate of inflation for the year would remain within the forecasted range of 2 - 2.5%. The current level of the policy rate remains consistent with the medium term outlook of relatively low and stable inflation and sustainable economic growth. The future stance of monetary policy would be determined by Bank Negara Malaysia's assessment of the implications of domestic and external developments on price stability and economic growth.

Romania,2007-05-02,"In its meeting of May 2, 2007, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for May 4, 2007. The analysis of macroeconomic indicators confirms that disinflation continued, faster than it had been forecasted, with the annual inflation rate falling to 3.66 percent in March versus 4.87 percent in December, due to a slower advance in administered prices and a reduction of volatile prices. Moreover, core inflation, excluding the effect of the vice tax, has fallen to 2.8 percent, reflecting both the fact that broad monetary conditions have remained restrictive, as well as a favorable impact of Romania's accession to the European Union via increased competition on the retail market. Statistics show a consolidation of investment as the main driver of economic growth in the last part of 2006 and a widening of the current account deficit in the context of persistently high dynamics of internal absorption as well as of a catching-up in the real convergence process. Non-government credit expansion has remained brisk against the background of a relative slowdown in the pace of increase in leu-denominated credit and of a revival of foreign currency lending growth. Broad monetary conditions have remained restrictive and are adequate to the aim of attaining medium-term disinflation targets in the context of the recent adjustment of the levels of monetary policy instruments, of faster leu appreciation and of tight minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 7.25 percent per annum from 7.5 percent and to pursue an adequate control of liquidity via open-market operations in line with money market conditions. The NBR Board has also decided to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions and to continue to align its minimum reserve requirements regulation (Regulation No. 6/2002) to the standards of the European Central Bank by removing in transit amounts from the reserve base and setting a zero reserve ratio applicable to savings banks for housing. Changes to the Regulation will come into force after their publication in the Official Gazette. The NBR reiterates that it will continue to vigilantly monitor the developments in macroeconomic indicators and their outlook in order to ensure that monetary conditions are in line with the achievement of medium-term disinflation objectives and to consolidate the convergence process with the European Union, relying also on the support from other components of the macroeconomic policy mix. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic context and inflation outlook, as well as the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for May 4, 2007. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for June 25, 2007."
United States,2007-05-09,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. Economic growth slowed in the first part of this year and the adjustment in the housing sector is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters. Core inflation remains somewhat elevated. Although inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures. In these circumstances, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.

Chile,2007-05-10,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 10 may 2007 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). The external scenario relevant to the Chilean economy remains favorable. World economic activity is expanding strongly, the copper price is still high and financial conditions remain positive. Prices of oil and derivatives, especially gasoline, as well as prices of some foods have remained high. Information available confirms stronger growth in domestic output in the first quarter of 2007, somewhat above earlier projections. Consumption is still robust, while both investment and exports have regained dynamism. Salaried employment continues to grow, and internal financial conditions are good. CPI inflation is below 3%, although slightly above last January's projections. Most recently, it has been affected by higher-than-expected fuel prices and core CPIX1 inflation (that excludes fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities), especially due to an increase in food prices. Alternative measures of trend inflation show no significant change. Most recently, growth in labor costs has increased from relatively low rates. Medium- and long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored around 3%. The Board reaffirms its commitment of conducting monetary policy to ensure that projected inflation will be at 3% over the policy horizon. Future changes in the monetary policy rate to achieve this objective will depend on incoming information and its implications on projected inflation. * The Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2007-05-10,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference here in Dublin. I would like to thank Governor Hurley for his kind hospitality and to express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of the meeting of the Governing Council. Let me now report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in March. Strong vigilance is of the essence in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. In turn, this will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Given the favourable economic environment, our monetary policy continues to be on the accommodative side, with the key ECB interest rates moderate, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. Turning first to the economic analysis, the latest indicators and survey data confirm that the expansion of economic activity continued in the first quarter of 2007 and remains solid and broad-based. Looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic growth in the euro area continues to be favourable. Conditions are in place for the ongoing expansion to proceed at sustained rates. Global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat in recent quarters, remains strong. External conditions thus continue to provide support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, strong corporate earnings and gains in business efficiency. Consumption should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, increasingly supported by employment growth and improving labour market conditions. The risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. At longer horizons, the balance of risks remains on the downside, stemming mainly from external factors. Such factors include fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of further increases in oil prices and concerns about possible disorderly developments due to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 1.8% in April 2007, after 1.9% in March. Looking at the coming months, barring further increases in oil prices, significant base effects deriving from last year's energy price volatility will strongly influence the profile of annual inflation rates. On the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, annual inflation rates are likely to fall somewhat in the months to come, before rising again towards the end of the year to hover at levels around 2%. Over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, the outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks. These relate notably to the increasing capacity utilisation in the euro area economy, the possibility of further oil price rises and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. More fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments could pose significant upward risks to price stability, not least in view of the favourable momentum in labour markets observed over the past few quarters. The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area countries with particular attention. It is crucial that the social partners meet their responsibilities so as to continue to avoid wage developments that would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and harm the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. In this context, it is also important to point out that wage agreements should be sufficiently differentiated and take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies and productivity developments across sectors. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. The underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong, in a context of already ample liquidity. The ongoing strength of monetary expansion is reflected in the increasingly rapid growth of M3, which in March reached an annual rate of 10.9%, as well as in the ongoing high levels of credit growth. Monetary and credit expansion is due partly to the moderate level of interest rates and solid economic growth. Short-term monetary and credit developments can be affected, inter alia, by the shape of the yield curve and external factors, and be subject to some degree of volatility. Looking through such transitory aspects, there are, however, several indications that higher short-term interest rates are influencing monetary dynamics, although they have not, as yet, significantly dampened the overall strength of these dynamics. For example, increases in short-term rates have served to moderate the expansion of the narrow aggregate. M1, in recent quarters, but its annual growth is still robust. Equally, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has shown some signs of stabilising since mid-2006, albeit at double-digit levels. All in all, taking into account both short-term factors and the underlying trend of the continued vigorous expansion of money and credit, there are clear indications of upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. In fact, following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. In this environment, monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and still strong property market developments. To sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look beyond any short-term volatility in inflation rates. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to stronger than currently expected wage developments in a context of ongoing robust growth in employment and economic activity. Given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to be strongly vigilant in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. In relation to fiscal policies, the Governing Council welcomes the recent commitment by the euro area finance ministers  at the Eurogroup meeting in Berlin on 20 April  to make full use of the current economic growth and better than expected tax revenues to pursue sound fiscal policies and to avoid procyclical policies in line with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. In the view of the Governing Council, this requires a rigorous implementation of 2007 budgets, the avoidance of expenditure overruns and the full allocation of unexpected extra revenues to deficit and debt reduction. For 2008, countries with remaining fiscal imbalances are expected to pursue more ambitious than planned budgetary targets As a result, all euro area countries should achieve their medium-term objective of sound budgetary positions as soon as possible and by 2010 at the latest. Moreover, all countries should avoid fiscal policies that feed macroeconomic imbalances. This would allow euro area countries to prepare themselves for less favourable economic conditions. As repeatedly stressed, the Governing Council fully supports structural reforms that enhance competition, increase productivity and foster economic flexibility, thus promoting the potential for real GDP growth and employment. Increased productivity also allows for increases in real wages without negatively impacting on employment, thereby supporting the income growth of the euro area work force. In recent years, average wage increases in the euro area as a whole have been rather moderate, making a vital contribution to job creation and lower unemployment. It is important that this favourable trend in labour markets continues, so contributing to a prolonged and robust upswing. In this respect, sufficient wage differentiation is required so as to improve employment opportunities for less skilled workers and in sectors and regions with high unemployment. Furthermore, the removal of impediments to labour mobility would help to address local imbalances in labour markets and to enhance the adjustment flexibility of euro area economies to economic shocks. The euro area could reap major benefits from these policies in terms of economic dynamism, more job creation, lower unemployment and increased per capita income."
Egypt,2007-05-10,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release May 10, 2007 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 875 percent per annu. In its meeting held on May 10, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 875 percent and 1075 percent, respectivel. For the first time in more than a year, the annual headline CPI inflation declined in April 2007 to 117 percent (y/y) compared to 128 percent in March 2007, consistent with the MPC's view that the annual headline CPI may have reached its pea. The most recent development came about as the base effect from last year's administered price adjustment and part of the avian flu supply shock started to level of. The annual headline inflation rates are expected to continue on this declining path as the base effect from the previous price increases related to the supply shocks fully level of. However inflationary demand pressures from the current economic growth continues to be a concer.

South Korea,2007-05-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). In the real economy, while exports continue to show steady growth, facilities investment maintains a robust growing pace and private consumption appears to be recovering. On the other hand, construction investment exhibits some degree of slowdown in its pace of expansion. Meanwhile, the current account has recorded a deficit owing mainly to the repatriation of dividends, although the goods account has remained in surplus. Consumer price inflation and core inflation both remain stable. The upward pace of real estate prices has significantly slowed down. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions' lending has shown a sharp increase led by those to small and medium enterprises. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period."
Turkiye,2007-05-14,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep short- term interest rates (policy rates) unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 17.50 percent, and lending rate at 22.50 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m.  4:30 p.m. at 13.50 percent, lending rate at 25.50 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 21.50 percent. Recent data on economic activity is broadly consistent with the outlook presented in the April Inflation Report. While the slowdown in private consumption demand continues, foreign demand remains relatively strong. Aggregate demand conditions continue to support disinflation. Against this background, disinflation is expected to become more significant in the upcoming period. Besides, the Committee noted that a partial correction in unprocessed food prices, and the base effect may contribute to the decline in annual inflation in May. However, the Committee, with a medium term perspective, decided to keep the policy rates unchanged against the risks such as the gap between inflation expectations and targets, the backward looking pricing behavior, elevated oil prices, prevailing uncertainties, and the stickiness related to services price inflation. The monetary tightening since June 2006 is affecting the domestic demand as expected. The lagged effects on inflation are yet to be seen. The potential impacts of the progress in the structural reform agenda and the developments in incomes policy as well as public sector non-interest expenditures on inflation and inflation expectations are carefully evaluated. Within this framework, the Committee assesses that meeting the medium term inflation targets requires the maintenance of the tight policy stance. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook will lead the Committee to reconsider its stance.

Peru,2007-05-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2007 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4,50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain the interbank reference rate at 4.5 percent, but expressed concerns about a possible inflationary impact in a 12-18 month horizon due to a very high increase of domestic demand. Therefore, should inflationary pressures be observed, the Board will be inclined to withdraw monetary stimulus. The Board analyzed recent macroeconomic developments and prospects based on data on the last month, including the following: The Consumer Price Index for Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.18 percent in April. As a result of this, the last 12-month CPI inflation rate fell from 0.25 percent in March to -0.08 percent in April, in line with the forecasts included in the Inflation Report of January. On the other hand, core inflation indicator of the trend of price increases was 0.13 percent, and accumulated a last 12-month rate of 1.48 percent (1.42 percent in March). Last 12-month inflation in the first months of 2007 should transitorily be below the lower band of the inflation target (1.0 percent). Inflation should be in the range of the inflation target in the second half of the year, in line with Inflation Report forecasts, and would converge to the 2.0 percent inflation target thereafter. Domestic demand grew from 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 to an estimated rate of 10.5 percent in the first quarter of 2007, mainly as a result of increased private consumption (6.9 percent) and private investment (18.8 percent). In this context, the Board stands ready to anticipate the eventual impact on prices of a very high expansion of internal spending in a 12-18 horizon through the withdrawal of monetary stimulus. The average monthly interest rate in the interbank market was 4.51 percent in April. Short-term rates are relatively stable, while long-term rates in domestic currency continue to show a downward trend. Thus, the average 90-day corporate prime rate in soles in the same month was 5.18 percent, decreasing by 1 basis point relative to March, while the yield on the 20-year sovereign bond in soles was 6.02 percent, 23 bps. lower than at end March. The General Index of the Lima Stock Exchange grew 20.5 percent in April. In March, last 12-month credit to the private sector grew 18.1 percent and 33.9 percent in the case of credit in domestic currency. In April, the nuevo sol appreciated on average 0.2 percent in nominal terms, closing at 3.179 per dollar. This evolution was mainly associated with a supply of dollars in the spot exchange market and in the forward market of US$ 601 million and US$ 900 million respectively. In this context, the Central Bank purchased US$ 1,330 million in the exchange market to reduce the volatility of exchange and to accumulate international reserves. This amount was higher than in March, due to operations associated to the regularization of income tax payments. During the session, the Board approved the annual interest rates on the following active and passive operations in soles between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.25 percent. Overnight deposits: 3.75 percent. Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the interest rates on the following operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight depostis: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage point. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.25 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 3.25 percent anually. The Board approved to initiate procedures to raise the limit for investments abroad by Private Administrators of Pension Funds from 13.5 to 15.0 percent. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (June 2007) on the session to be held on June 7, 2007."
Thailand,2007-05-23,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 23 May 2007 Ms. Suchada Kirakul. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. Overall domestic demand continued to soften due to a slowdown in private expenditure and fragile confidence. Although the government accelerated spending, government expenditure had yet to achieve the target. Meanwhile exports continued to expand favorably in line with global economic conditions and the ability of exporters to adapt to the current environment. However there remained a risk to export growth should the global economy slow down going forward. Inflation continued to moderate as expected. The MPC thus assessed that despite higher global oil prices, inflationary pressure would remain low due to a slowdown in domestic demand. The MPC viewed that, with subdued inflationary pressures, monetary policy could be eased to facilitate economic growth, while inflationary pressures remained manageable. The MPC therefore decided to lower the 1-day repurchase rate by 05 per cent from 400 per cent per annum to 350 per cent per annum, effective today. The current rate was deemed suitable in ensuring the inflation target and supporting economic expansion."
Israel,2007-05-28,"28.5.2007</td> The Bank of Israel interest rate for June 2007 cut by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for June 2007 will be cut by 25 basis points, to 3.5 percent. This step is consistent with the Bank of Israel's policy of aiming for the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: In line with earlier forecasts, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.5 percent in April. In the last twelve months the CPI has fallen by 1.3 percent, so that the rate of inflation over that period was below the lower boundary of the target range of 1 percent. In contrast, the domestic component of prices, as calculated by econometric models, rose by more than 2 percent. This discrepancy between changes in the CPI andlocal prices is mostly explained by the appreciation of the shekel againstthe dollar. Forecasts: The average prediction of inflation for the next twelve months by Israeli forecasters stands at 1.2 percent. At the same time, most private forecasters expect a cut of 25 basis points in the interest ratefor June. Their forecasts for the Bank of Israel interest rate at the end of 2007 range between 3.25 percent and 4 percent. The expectation of inflation over the next 12 months, as derived from the capital markets, is 0.5 percent, while the makam curve impliesthat the interest rate will decline by 0.3 percentage points during the next year. According to the econometric models, assuming the exchange rate against the dollar remains at about its current level and that the Bank of Israel interest rate is cut by 25 basis points, inflation will return to within the target range in the first half of 2008. Real economic activity: According to data of the CBS published yesterday, in the first quarter of the year, the expansion in economic activity continued. GDP grew by 6.3 percent (in annual terms), the unemployment rate dipped by 0.1 percentage points to 7.7 percent, and the rate of participation in the labor force rose by 0.5 percentage points to 56.1 percent. After four years of increases, the upward trend in labor productivity has come to a halt and as a result, unit labor costs appear to be rising. Government activity: The government registered a surplus in its finances, mostly due to a rise in tax revenues. Government budget data are consistent with an annual deficit of between 1 percent and 1.5 percent of GDP. Forex market: Since the previous interest rate decision (18/4/07), the shekel has strengthened against the dollar and the euro by 0.9 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively. Most of this appreciation of the shekel was due to domestic factors. Average daily trading volume on the forex marketin May rose to $1.7 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the previous five quarters. Capital market: Since the previous interest rate decision, share prices on the stock exchange rose by 5 percent, further to a rapid increaseof about 14 percent from the beginning of the year until mid-April. At thesame time, yields on government bonds of all maturities fell by about 0.2 percentage points. For some of the period, the yield to maturity on 10-yearlocal-currency government bond was lower than that on 10-year US government bonds. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, remained at the low level of 0.17 percent. Global background conditions: Strong global growth is expected tocontinue in the coming year albeit at a more moderate pace; global inflation remains relatively moderate and is expected to continue falling. Capitalmarkets expect that the US Fed funds rate will be cut by 25 basis points by the end of the year. The markets expect the European and Japanese centralbanks to continue raising interest rates. The main considerations behind the decision In the framework of the Bank of Israel's commitment to the government-set inflation target of 1-3 percent, a reduction in the interest rate is required to raise the probability of returning inflation to within the target range in the first months of 2008. Despite therise in domestic prices as derived from econometric models and the economic expansion of recent years, there still appear to be no inflationary pressures, whether in inflation expectations or in actual inflation figures. The reduction of 25 basis points in the interest rate is based, inter alia, on the need to continue to contribute to the preservation of financial stability. In this framework, the Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in, and the functioning of, the financial markets. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. Please note: The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decisionwill be published on 11 June 2007. The decision regarding the interest rate for July will be published at 18:30 on 25 June 2007. 28.5.2007</td> The Bank of Israel interest rate for June 2007 cut by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent.

Malaysia,2007-05-28,"At its meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. Despite the less favourable external environment which has had a moderating effect on Malaysia's export growth, strong domestic demand has sustained the growth of the Malaysian economy. The public sector has also had an important positive impact on domestic economic activity. The Malaysian economy is therefore expected to sustain steady growth over the medium term. Inflation during the first four months of 2007 averaged 2.4% and has continued its downward trend. Going forward, the continued high prices of commodities and agricultural products, and the rise in global food prices could have implications for domestic food prices and overall inflation. Taking into account these developments and the low inflation prevailing currently, the expectations are that the average rate of inflation for 2007 would be within the projected range of 2-2.5 percent. Given the medium term outlook for inflation and economic growth, the current level of the policy rate remains appropriate. In view of the uncertainty in the external environment, developments in the international economy would be monitored closely. The future stance of monetary policy would be determined by Bank Negara Malaysia's assessment of new data and information and its implications on the prospects for price stability and economic growth. Bank Negara Malaysia 28 May 2007."
Philippines,2007-05-30,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The tiering system on bank placements with the BSP was also kept in place, including those on SDA placements by trust entities. The Monetary Board assessed that the outlook for inflation over the policy horizon continues to be benign, due mainly to easing supply-side pressures, moderate demand pressures and well-contained inflation expectations. Ample supply of major food items, the subsiding base effect of the RVAT on the CPI, and the strengthening of the peso have contributed to the continued downtrend in inflation. However, sustained growth in domestic liquidity remains a key policy concern. Domestic liquidity expansion has remained strong in the past several months and although current inflation has continued to decelerate, a prolonged surge in liquidity could eventually pose risks to future inflation. In addition, volatility in oil prices remains a risk to the inflation outlook, given the limited production capacity and the threat of possible geopolitical disruptions. The possibility of additional wage adjustments also provides some upside risks. The implementation of the new monetary measures beginning 10 May 2007 is expected to help siphon off additional liquidity in the system and thereby exert a mitigating impact on future inflation. While the initial results have been encouraging, the recent policy moves need to be given more time to fully work their way through the financial system and achieve their objective of keeping domestic liquidity growth down to a more modest pace. This will also allow further assessment of the liquidity impact of the continued strong foreign exchange inflows into the economy. For the next several months, the BSP will closely monitor the impact of the new measures on monetary conditions which will serve as basis for subsequent monetary policy actions to ensure that the benign inflation environment is maintained over the policy horizon."
Poland,2007-05-30,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 30 May 2007 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 29-30 May 2007 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 4.25 % on an annual basis; lombard rate 5.75 % on an annual basis; deposit rate 2.75% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.50% on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of strong growth encompassing all its sectors. The data released in May confirm previous assessments that strong economic activity should be sustained for at least next few quarters, even though economic growth in the next quarters will be probably slightly lower than in 2007 Q1. The continuation of fast economic growth in Poland will be supported by strong activity in the world economy and, particularly, the consolidating recovery in the euro area, which is taking place in the conditions of stable inflation. In April the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland amounted to 2.3%, which was close to the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. In the Council's assessment the high growth of domestic demand, which most probably exceeds the growth of potential GDP, will be sustained in the next quarters. The latest data on labour market developments point to a further build-up in wage pressure, which may lead to an increase in inflation. The Council assesses, however, that in the medium term inflation increase will be constrained primarily by a probable continuation of high productivity growth supported by high investment growth, very good financial results of enterprises and low growth of external prices, related to globalisation and the ensuing intensified competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services. In the Council's assessment in 2007 Q3 CPI inflation may temporarily fall below its present level. In the Council's assessment, in the medium term, the probability of inflation running above the inflation target decreased owing to the last month's NBP interest rate increase, though it remains higher than the probability of inflation running below the target. A more comprehensive assessment of the scale of risk of inflation overshooting the inflation target will only be possible after analysing the data to be released in the coming months. The Council will be closely monitoring the relation between wage and labour productivity growth, zloty exchange rate, the impact of globalisation on the economy and other factors."
Nigeria,2007-06-05,"PRESS RELEASE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 50 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. JUNE 5, 2007 The Monetary Policy Committee of the CBN met on 5th June 2007 and decided to reduce the MPR by 200 basis points, ie., from 100 per cent to 80 per cent 1) The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 5th June, 2007 and reviewed the major macroeconomic developments and the implementation of fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies in the first five months of 2007, as well as the challenges for the rest of the year. The meeting, the second in 2007, lasted three hours. The MPC noted with satisfaction the macroeconomic performances in the first five months, as inflation and naira/dollar exchange rates stabilized further. It however, noted the potential threat to inflation. The Committee, therefore, expressed its commitment to sustaining macroeconomic stability. Key Macroeconomic Developments 2) Inflation: The MPC noted that the inflation rate stayed within single digit in the first four months of 2007. In particular, the year-on-year (headline) inflation dropped steadily from 85 per cent at end-December 2006 to 42 per cent in April 2007. The Committee also observed that although the current estimates show that inflation would remain single-digit at the end of the second-quarter, inflation pressures still persist. 3) Exchange Rate: The MPC noted with satisfaction the continued stability of the naira exchange rate in the first five months of 2007 as the naira remained stable at both the wDAS and the BDCs during the period. The naira exchange rate in the wDAS moved between N12660/US$1 and N12829/US$1 (rate +1%) in January through May, 2007. In addition, the premium between the wDAS and BDC rates narrowed from 139 per cent in January to 12 per cent in May 2007. The Committee noted the positive impact of the stability in exchange rate on the economy generally, particularly in locking-in inflationary expectations. Thus the MPC reaffirmed its commitment to sustain the liberalization of the foreign exchange market. 4) External Reserves: From $4196 billion at end December 2006, gross official reserves rose to $4348 billion as at 28th May, 2007, which could finance 25 months of imports. The Committee, however, noted the risk to growth of reserves arising from the decline in the volume of crude oil production due to disturbances in the Niger Delta, but welcomed the initiatives of the government to resolve the crisis. 5) Growth in Monetary Aggregates: At the end of the first quarter, 2007, broad money grew by 880 per cent and moderated to 770 per cent at end- 2 April 2007, which when annualized showed a growth of 230 per cent compared with the target of 190 per cent for entire 2007. The rise in M2 was attributable to the combined effects of the increases in foreign asset (net) of the banking system and credit to the private sector. 6) Credit: Growth in aggregate domestic credit (net) declined by about 637 per cent at end-March, and by 387 per cent in April, 2007 relative to its level at end-December 2006. The fall in aggregate credit was attributed mainly to the decline in credit (net) to government during the period. Meanwhile credit to the private sector grew by about 240 per cent in first four months ending April 2007, reflecting a growth of 720 per cent on annualized basis. The target for the year is 300 per cent. The Committee noted, however, that a significant proportion of the credit went into import financing, which have low inflation risk for the domestic economy. The spending items included payments for Telecommunications and Information Technology imports and the payment for oil blocs in foreign currencies. 7) Reserve Money: At end-March, the reserve money (N8410 billion) was on target under the PSI programme. In April 2007, however, reserve money rose to N8960 billion, while the forecast to end-June 2007 is about N92650 billion, which is higher than the PSI target by N665 billion. The surge in reserve money is attributable to the expansion in demand for currency and 3 growth in banks' balances with the CBN. The MPC, therefore, stressed the need to intensify liquidity mop up operations to reduce the excess liquidity. It also agreed to apply some price and non-price disincentives to encourage banks to be more professional in their liquidity management. 8) Interest Rates Developments: The introduction of the CBN Standing Facility since December 2006 has continued to moderate the volatility in inter- bank rates in the first five months of 2007. In particular, the average inter- bank call rate moderated from 898 per cent in December 2006 to 754 per cent in April and to 76 per cent in May 2007. The decline in rates was due to the continued surfeit of funds in the market. With the year-on-year inflation rate at 420 per cent in April 2007, the inter-bank rates and other rates in the banking system have become strongly positive OUTLOOK FOR REST OF 2007 AND MPC DECISIONS The MPC noted that though inflation has moderated significantly, the downside risk remained. The Committee also noted the challenges in achieving the exit target reserve money by end-June, 2007; the rising autonomous private inflows and the risk of over-appreciation of the naira/dollar exchange rate. The Committee, however, noted that the upside risk was strong. These included the continued stability of the exchange rate; the strong external sector reserves as well as the recent maiden broadcast of Mr. President to the Nation on sustaining the economic reforms. On the whole the Committee believes that the medium term outlook is one of robust economic performance. Against this background the Committee decided to: a) Introduce tenured repo at MPR b) Reduce the MPR by 200 basis points, ie. from 100 per cent to 80 per cent c) Reduce the width of the interest rate corridor from +/- 300 to +/- 250 basis points. The combined implication of (b) and (c) is that the deposit facility now stands at 55 per cent while the lending facility would be 105 per cent, both down from 7 and 13 per cent, respectively. d) Both facilities are expected to be used as a last resort. Consequently the frequent usage of these facilities will attract penalty. e) Increase the issuance of primary market instruments to mop up about N100 billion; 5 f) That inter-bank placements shall henceforth form part of the deposits for calculating banks' liquidity ratio and g) Continued use of open market operations (OMO) in liquidity management Thank you for your kind attention.

Euroarea,2007-06-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. At today's meeting, we decided to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision was taken in view of the prevailing upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. Today's decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards fostering sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. After today's increase, given the positive economic environment in the euro area, our monetary policy is still on the accommodative side, with overall financing conditions favourable, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample. Looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. The Governing Council will monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Incoming information clearly confirms that the euro area economy continues to expand at a pace which is significantly stronger than generally expected a year ago. With a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.6%, real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2007 was again somewhat above previous expectations. Other available information on economic activity, notably various surveys of business and consumer confidence, suggests that solid growth has continued into the second quarter. Looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic activity remains favourable. The conditions are in place for the euro area economy to continue to grow at a sustained rate. As regards the external environment, global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat, remains robust. External conditions thus continue to provide support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from financing conditions which remain favourable, accumulated and ongoing strong corporate earnings, balance sheet restructuring as well as business efficiency gains achieved over an extended period. Meanwhile, consumption should be supported by developments in real disposable income, as labour market conditions continue to improve. This outlook is also reflected in the new Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. The projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 2.3% and 2.9% in 2007 and between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2008. In comparison with the previous ECB staff projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2007 are within the upper part of the ranges from March. For 2008, the ranges have been revised marginally downwards, following the increase in oil prices over recent months. In the Governing Council's view, the risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. At medium to longer horizons, the balance of risks remains on the downside, owing mainly to external factors. These relate in particular to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of further increases in oil prices, concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances and potential shifts in financial market sentiment. As regards price developments, oil prices have risen again over recent months. Accordingly, as reflected in Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 1.9% in May 2007, unchanged from April but somewhat higher than expected a few months ago. Looking ahead, the short-term profile of annual inflation rates continues to be determined largely by current and past energy price developments, as last year's volatility in energy prices leads to significant base effects. On the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, which show an upward slope, annual inflation rates are likely to fall slightly in the months ahead before rising again significantly towards the end of the year. Consistent with this view. Eurosystem staff projects average annual HICP inflation of between 1.8% and 2.2% in 2007 and between 1.4% and 2.6% in 2008. Compared with the March 2007 ECB staff projections, the range projected for inflation in 2007 is somewhat higher, largely reflecting higher oil prices. In this context, let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections, which are based on a series of technical assumptions, including assumptions for future short and long-term interest rates that are based on market expectations derived from the yield curve, as well as assumptions for oil and non-energy commodity prices. At the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, risks to the outlook for price stability remain on the upside in the Governing Council's view. In particular, capacity utilisation in the euro area economy is increasing and labour markets are gradually improving. Accordingly, there is a risk that wage developments will be stronger than expected, which would pose significant upward risks to price stability. In addition, pricing power in market segments with low competition may increase in such an environment. It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities. Wage agreements in particular should be sufficiently differentiated to take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies and sector-specific productivity developments. The Governing Council stresses that wage developments should be avoided which would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and harm the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. In addition, upside risks to price stability arise from increases in administered prices beyond those anticipated thus far. Finally, on the external side, upside risks stem from the possibility of further unexpected oil price rises. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. The underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong, in a context of already ample liquidity. The ongoing strength of monetary expansion is reflected in the continued rapid growth of M3, which reached an annual rate of 10.4% in April, as well as the still high level of credit growth. The strong rate of monetary and credit expansion reflects, in part, favourable financing conditions and solid economic growth. In the short term, monetary and credit developments can be affected, inter alia, by the shape of the yield curve and external factors, and be subject to some degree of volatility. In assessing the policy-relevant underlying trends in monetary and credit growth, it is important to look through such transitory aspects. Taking this perspective, there are several indications that higher short-term interest rates are now influencing monetary dynamics, although they have not, as yet, significantly dampened the overall strength of the underlying rate of monetary and credit expansion. For example, increases in short-term rates have contributed to a more moderate expansion of the narrow aggregate. M1, in recent quarters. Equally, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has shown some signs of stabilising since mid-2006, albeit at double-digit levels. The stabilisation of loan growth is now becoming more broad-based, as evidenced in recent months by developments in borrowing by non-financial corporations and by households. At the same time, house price growth has come down somewhat, although remaining at high levels on average in the euro area. Taking into account both short-term factors and the underlying trend of the continued vigorous expansion of money and credit, there are clear indications of upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area remains ample. In this environment, monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of the expansion in economic activity and still strong property market developments. To sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look beyond any short-term volatility in inflation rates. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to the domestic side. As capacity utilisation increases and labour markets gradually improve, constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to stronger than expected wage developments. Given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. Accordingly, the Governing Council will monitor closely all developments in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. Looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. As regards fiscal policy, all countries should be in line with the rules and provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. This will be crucial for the smooth functioning of Monetary Union, given that the Stability and Growth Pact is an indispensable part of its institutional setting. Following the significant budgetary improvement recorded in 2006, the latest available forecasts suggest a further reduction in the government deficit-to-GDP ratio of the euro area over the period 2007-08. This reflects in particular projected ongoing strong revenue collection in the context of a favourable macroeconomic outlook. The current economic “good times” should be used to rapidly redress the remaining budgetary imbalances in euro area countries as well as to accelerate the adjustment towards their medium-term objectives of sound budget positions with a focus on expenditure restraint. As agreed by the euro area finance ministers at the Eurogroup meeting in Berlin on 20 April, taking advantage of the favourable cyclical conditions would enable most euro area members to achieve their medium-term objectives in 2008 or 2009, and all of them should aim for 2010 at the latest. This is particularly important with a view to reducing the still high government debt ratios and preparing for the fiscal challenges arising from population ageing. In order to ensure that fiscal developments are monitored effectively, the Governing Council supports all efforts by Eurostat to improve the fiscal data situation. It also welcomes the increased emphasis placed by the ECOFIN Council on measures to improve the quality of public finances and increase the efficiency of public administration. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council fully supports any efforts that enhance competition, increase productivity and foster economic flexibility, thus promoting higher sustainable real GDP growth and employment. In this respect, we strongly back reforms focusing on reducing labour market rigidities, product market barriers and administrative burdens, and on stimulating technological innovation. Exploiting the complementary nature of reforms would increase their benefits in terms of long-term economic dynamism and price stability. Furthermore, the importance of a successful conclusion of the Doha round of trade talks for productivity and growth in Europe should not be underestimated. In the end, higher productivity growth will allow increases in real wages without negatively affecting employment, thereby supporting the income growth of the euro area workforce."
South Africa,2007-06-07,"CPIX inflation breached the upper end of the inflation target range in April 2007 for the first time since August 2003. The year-on-year increase of 6,3 per cent was higher than that expected by the Bank and most forecasters. The petrol price had increased by R0,69 per litre in April, and this was expected to contribute to an increase in the inflation rate. This was compounded by strong increases in food prices as well as generalised increases in some other categories. The breach of the target is in the past and there is nothing that monetary policy can do about past inflation. Nevertheless the Monetary Policy Committee cannot ignore the possible impact of this breach on inflation expectations and the public's understanding of the monetary policy process. Monetary policy acts with a lag, and the focus of the MPC will remain, as always, on the medium-term inflation outlook which is the period over which monetary policy can be effective. Year-on-year inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds (CPIX) increased at a year-on-year rate of 6,3 per cent in April 2007 compared to 4,9 per cent in February and 5,5 per cent in March. Food and petrol price increases accounted for most of the increase, but more broad-based pressures are also becoming evident. If food and energy were excluded. CPIX inflation would have measured 4,6 per cent in April compared to 3,9 per cent in January. Although this measure is still well within the target range, the recent strong upward trend is indicative of more broadly-based price pressures. The biggest impetus to the increase in the inflation rate in April came from the petrol price. Petrol prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 15,5 per cent in April compared to 7,9 per cent in March 2007. Food price inflation also continued its upward trend measuring 7,8 per cent and 8,6 per cent in March and April respectively. The higher food price inflation in April was driven mainly by grain product and meat price increases. Grain product prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 10,6 per cent compared to meat price increases of 10,8 per cent. The latter, although still high, are significantly lower than the peak increases of almost 20 per cent in October and November last year. Prices of household consumables increased by 8 per cent in April, compared to 6,1 per cent in February. Services price inflation has also been increasing steadily, having measured 5,5 per cent on a year-on-year basis in April, compared to 4,6 per cent in January. Certain components of housing services made a significant contribution to this upward trend. Pressures on inflation continue to be moderated by price declines in clothing, footwear, furniture and recreation and entertainment. Production price inflation increased at a year-on-year rate of 11,1 per cent in April, compared to 9,5 per cent and 10,3 per cent in February and March respectively. These developments point to further pressures on CPIX inflation in the coming months. The April increase was the highest since December 2002. Apart from textiles, clothing and footwear, the increases were across a wide spectrum. Prices of domestically produced goods increased by 11,2 per cent in April compared to 10,5 per cent for imported goods. The most recent central forecast of the Bank's models indicates a further deterioration in the inflation outlook compared to the previous forecast. The forecast, which takes account of the petrol price increases of May and June, projects that CPIX inflation will remain marginally above the upper level of the inflation target range in the second quarter of 2007. After a technical decline in the third quarter. CPIX inflation is expected to marginally exceed 6 per cent in the subsequent two quarters, peaking at an average of 6,3 in the first quarter of 2008. Thereafter. CPIX inflation is projected to follow a downward trajectory and to average 5,3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2008. The higher trend of the forecast in the near term compared to the previous forecast is a result of a slightly higher oil price assumption. The committee continues to view the risks to the outlook to be strongly on the upside. Inflation expectations are an important indicator of possible future inflation trends because of their impact on wage and price setting processes. According to the most recent inflation expectations survey conducted in May on behalf of the Bank by the Bureau for Economic Research at the University of Stellenbosch, there had been some deterioration in inflation expectations which had moved back to the levels of the fourth quarter of 2006. Nevertheless inflation expectations still remained within the inflation target range. Respondents expected CPIX inflation to average 5,5 per cent this year, and to moderate to 5,3 per cent and 5,2 per cent respectively in the coming two years. Expectations of trade unionists increased the most since the previous survey. Labour and business expectations were then significantly higher than those of analysts, but all groups were within the target range for all three survey years. The bond markets have also shown evidence of some deterioration in expectations. In reaction to the April inflation data, long-term bond yields increased further and the yield curve shifted upwards, although it remained inverted. The break-even inflation rate, which is the difference between the yield on conventional bonds and the yield on inflation-linked bonds, increased by about 50 basis points to around 5,6 per cent since the end of May. The MPC identified a number of upside risks to the outlook. These include food and oil prices and continued high rates of household consumption expenditure. The assessment of most of the other variables was relatively unchanged since the previous meeting. Oil remains an upside risk to the inflation outlook. The price of North Sea Brent crude oil has averaged US$68 per barrel since the previous MPC meeting and is currently trading above US$72 per barrel. International prices remain dominated by geopolitical tensions, fluctuating inventory levels and supply disruptions in a number of oil-producing countries. Futures prices suggest that upward pressure on oil prices is expected to persist in the near future. The domestic petrol price was increased by R0,34 and R0,23 per litre in May and June respectively. These increases, which were due to international product price increases, were cushioned to some extent by the behaviour of the exchange rate. Pressure on inflation emanating from food price increases is expected to persist for some time. This may be attributed to international food price developments which have seen the diversion of grain products to biofuel production and increased food demands as a result of higher global real incomes. Household consumption expenditure has remained strong although preliminary estimates suggest that there has been a slight moderation in the first quarter. Growth in new passenger motor vehicle sales has been declining since late last year, but the most recent trend has been distorted by problems related to the teething challenges during the introduction of the new electronic licensing system. Sales of commercial and heavy vehicles remain strong, reflecting the strong state of the economy. Growth in retail sales declined to a year-on-year rate of 8,0 per cent in February compared to 9,9 per cent the previous month, but growth accelerated to a year-on-year rate of 10,1 per cent in March. The continued underlying strength in household consumption expenditure is reflected in the high rates of domestic credit extended to the private sector. Twelve-month growth in banks' loans and advances extended to the private sector measured 26,2 per cent in March before increasing to 27,4 per cent in April. Adjusted for the cumulative effect of securitisation transactions, growth has remained around 29 per cent. Growth in mortgage advances, which had previously exhibited a slight declining trend, increased at a year-on-year rate of 27,6 per cent in April. In line with declining trend in passenger motor vehicle sales, instalment sale and leasing finance increased by 17,2 per cent and 16,9 per cent in March and April respectively. Consistent with the growth in fixed capital formation, advances to the corporate sector accounted for the strongest increases in bank lending. The sustained strength in consumer demand has been underpinned by higher levels of employment, higher real incomes and improved household balance sheets. Higher equity and house prices contributed to this positive wealth effect. The All-share index on the JSE Limited reached new heights in the past weeks, in tandem with strong equity market performances in a number of countries. According to the Absa and Standard Bank house price indices, house prices continue to increase although at moderately slower rates. South Africa's economic growth rate declined moderately in the first quarter of 2007 to an annualised quarter-on-quarter rate of 4,7 per cent. The decline is attributable mainly to a contraction in the mining sector and slower manufacturing sector growth. The construction sector grew at over 21 per cent mainly as a result of non-residential construction and civil engineering projects. This strong performance is indicative of the continuing domestic investment boom which has been given further impetus by the investment activities of public corporations. The economy is still growing at a rate around estimated potential and the higher rate of fixed capital formation, which is now in excess of 20 per cent of GDP, is expected to sustain economic growth going forward as well as increase the growth potential of the economy. The utilisation of production capacity in manufacturing increased by a further 0,3 percentage points in the first quarter of 2007 to 86,5 per cent. However, growth in the manufacturing sector appears to have moderated somewhat. Manufacturing output declined between March and April of this year, and the most recent Investec Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) also indicates a slowdown of the manufacturing sector's growth momentum. According to the most recent Wage Settlement Survey by Andrew Levy Employment Publications, wage settlements averaged 6,5 per cent in 2006 and remained at this rate in the first quarter of 2007. These increases are consistent with the inflation target if account is taken of positive changes in labour productivity. The exchange rate of the rand is trading at levels similar to those prevailing at the time of the previous MPC meeting. The volatility observed since the last meeting can be attributed mainly to movements of the US dollar against other currencies. The deficit on the trade account of the balance of payments narrowed as a result of an expected decline in the volume of imported oil. Preliminary data suggest that the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments in the first quarter was narrower than that experienced in the final quarter of 2006. As before, this deficit was comfortably financed by net financial inflows. In the year to date, non-resident net purchases of bonds and equities have totaled around R45 billion. The bulk of this has been equity investments, reflecting continued confidence in South Africa's macroeconomic policy framework and the related growth prospects. This is also illustrated further by the revision of the outlook from stable to positive of South Africa's external sovereign debt rating by Moody's rating agency. Further progress was also made with international reserve accumulation. At the end of May, official gross gold and other foreign exchange reserves had increased to US$ 27,9 billion, while the international liquidity position had risen to US$ 25,5 billion. Aside from oil and food price developments, the international economic environment remains relatively favourable. World growth is expected to remain strong although slightly lower than that achieved last year. The main risk to growth is seen to emanate from the housing market in the United States, although this risk appears to have dissipated somewhat. In general, international interest rates are not expected to decline in the near future, while further increases may still occur in some regions. The generally tighter monetary policy stance is expected to keep inflation contained despite pressures from rising oil and food prices. Growth prospects in the CMA region remain positive, although member countries are also experiencing inflation pressures from food and oil prices. The Monetary Policy Committee has decided that in view of the further deterioration in the inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance needs to be adjusted to ensure that CPIX inflation returns to within the inflation target range over time. Accordingly, the repo rate will be increased by 50 basis points to 9,5 per cent per annum with effect from Friday 8 June 2007. The MPC will continue to monitor developments which have a bearing on inflation outcomes and will not hesitate to adjust the policy stance as may be appropriate."
South Korea,2007-06-08,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). In the real economy, while exports continue to show steady growth, facilities and construction investment maintain robust paces of increase, and private consumption appears to be recovering. Meanwhile, the current account has recorded a deficit recently owing mainly to the narrowed goods account surplus and the repatriation of dividends. Consumer price inflation and core inflation both remain stable. The upward pace of real estate prices has slowed down significantly. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions' lending has increased sharply, led by loans to small and medium-sized enterprises. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period."
Chile,2007-06-14,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 14 June 2007 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). The external scenario relevant to the Chilean economy remains favorable. World economic activity confirms its dynamism, with better prospects for developed economies, which has contributed to increase medium and long term interest rates. Prices of copper and of oil and derivatives, especially gasoline, as well as prices of some foods, remain high. Information available on domestic output and expenditure show increased strength that exceeds previous projections, raising the probability of higher growth than contemplated in last Monetary Policy Report's baseline scenario. In particular, it is worth highlighting the vigor of private consumption, investment and exports. Salaried employment continues on the rise and, despite recent increases in market interest rates, internal financial conditions are favorable. CPI inflation is slightly below 3% and continues to be influenced by fuel prices and by a rebound of core CPIX1 inflation (that excludes fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities), which has been particularly affected by higher prices of foods and some health-related products. Beyond the increases of these specific prices, alternative measures of trend inflation have risen, while inflation expectations for the medium and long term remain well anchored around 3%. The Board reaffirms its commitment of conducting monetary policy to ensure that projected inflation will be at 3% over the policy horizon. This implies that, should inflation prospects consolidate at a level that exceeds the forecast of the last Monetary Policy Report, it will be necessary to reduce the monetary stimulus. * The Spanish original prevails."
Turkiye,2007-06-14,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided to keep short-term interest rates (policy rates) unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 17.50 percent, and lending rate at 22.50 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m.  4:30 p.m. at 13.50 percent, lending rate at 25.50 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 21.50 percent. Recent data on economic activity is broadly consistent with the outlook presented in the April Inflation Report. While the slowdown in private demand becomes more pronounced, foreign demand remains strong. Aggregate demand conditions increasingly support disinflation. Against this background, inflation is expected to maintain its downward trend. However, the Committee decided to keep the policy rates unchanged against the risks such as the gap between inflation expectations and targets, the backward looking pricing behavior, the remaining uncertainties notwithstanding recent favorable developments over services price inflation, rising oil prices, and prevailing uncertainties. The lagged effects of monetary tightening exercised since June 2006 are quite noticeable. Besides, the potential impacts of the progress in the structural reform agenda and the developments in incomes policy as well as public sector non-interest expenditures on inflation and inflation expectations are carefully evaluated. Within this framework, the Committee assesses that meeting the medium term inflation targets requires the maintenance of the tight policy stance.

Peru,2007-06-15,"MONETARY PROGR- AM FOR JUNE 2007 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain the interbank reference rate at 4.5 percent, as inflation is in the lower band of the inflation target (between 1 and 3 percent) and core inflation remains stable at 1.5 percent. This evolution reflects a balance between a strong dynamism of domestic demand and improved productivity in the economy. The Board follows closely the evolution of these variables and their impact on inflation in a 12-18 month horizon in order to make any preventive adjustment in the monetary policy stance should this be required. The Board analyzed recent macroeconomic developments and prospects based on data for the last month, including the following: The Consumer Price Index for Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.49 percent in May, as a result of which the last 12-month CPI inflation rate was 0.94 percent. On the other hand, core inflation indicator of the trend of price increases was 0.09 percent and accumulated a last 12-month rate of 1.5 percent (the same rate as in April). Annual inflation in the first months of 2007 has been below 1.0 percent, in line with the forecasts of our January Inflation Report. In May inflation started to converge to the inflation target of 2.0 percent and is expected to be within the inflation target (between 1 and 3 percent) as of June. Non-financial companies expect inflation to be at 1.5 percent in 2007, while financial entities and economic analysts expect inflation to be at 1.9 percent. Domestic demand grew from 12.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 10.2 percent in the first quarter of 2007, mainly as a result of increased private consumption (7.4 percent) and private investment (19.5 percent). The average monthly interest rate in the interbank market was 4.49 percent in May. Short-term rates are relatively stable, while long-term rates in domestic currency continue to show a downward trend. Thus, the average 90-day corporate prime rate in soles in the same month was 5.18 percent  the same rate as in April, while the yield on the 20-year sovereign bond in soles at the close of the month was 6.01 percent, 1 bp. lower than at end April. The General Index of the Lima Stock Exchange fell 2.6 percent in May. Moreover, in April, last 12-month credit to the private sector (without considering the effect of exchange fluctuations) grew 21percent (18 percent in March) and 39 percent in the case of credit in domestic currency (33 percent in March). In May the nuevo sol appreciated on average 0.3 percent in nominal terms, closing at 3.175 per dollar. This evolution was mainly associated with a supply of dollars in the spot exchange market and in the forward market of US$ 1,389 million and US$ 440 million respectively. In this context, the Central Bank purchased US$ 1,671 million in the exchange market to reduce the volatility of exchange and to accumulate international reserves. During the session, the Board approved the annual interest rates on the following active and passive operations in soles between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.25 percent. Overnight deposits: 3.75 percent. Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the interest rates on the following operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight depostis: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage point. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.25 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 3.25 percent anually. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (July 2007) in the session to be held on July 5, 2007."
United States,2007-06-18,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. Economic growth appears to have been moderate during the first half of this year, despite the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector. The economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures. In these circumstances, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Thomas M Hoenig; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Cathy E Minehan; Frederic S Mishkin; Michael H Moskow; William Poole; and Kevin M Warsh."
Israel,2007-06-25,"25.6.07 The Bank of Israel interest rate remains unchanged for July 2007 at 3.5 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for July 2007 will remain unchanged at 3.5 percent. This is consistent with the policy of maintaining price stability, as expressed by the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained unchangedin May, slightly above earlier forecasts. In the last twelve months the CPI has fallen by 1.3 percent, a rate of inflation significantly below the lower boundary of the target inflation range. Forecasts: Israeli forecasters predict, on average, that inflation for the next twelve months will reach 2.3 percent. At the same time, theyexpect, on average, that the Bank of Israel interest rate will stand at 3.75 percent in a year's time. The expectation of inflation over the next 12 months, as derived from the capital markets, now stands at 2.1 percent, close to the midpoint of the target range. The market expects that the interest rate will rise by 0.25 percentage points over the same period. Real economic activity: The expansion in economic activity continues, and GDP is expected to grow this year by 5.1 percent. The composite state-of-the-economy index rose in May by 0.7 percent. The closure of the output gap following continued economic expansion is still not reflected in a rise in unit labor costs, although unit labor costs, which have fallen for the past three years, are no longer declining. Government activity: The continuing trend in increased governmentrevenues is expected to bring the deficit this year to between 1 percent and 1.5 percent of GDP. However recent government decisions on the budget have increased the risks of raising the path of public expenditures. Forex market: Since the previous interest rate decision (on May 27) up till June 25, the shekel weakened against the dollar and the euro by 5.4 percent and 5.7 percent, respectively. Despite this weakening of the shekel against the dollar, the underlying forces supporting the value of the shekel--the surplus in the current account of the balance of payments and foreign investment in the economy--continue.Capital markets: Since the previous interest rate decision (on May 27) up till June 25, share prices on the stock exchange rose by 1.5 percent, in line with global trends. Since the beginning of June, yield to maturity on 10-year government local-currency bonds rose by 0.6 percentage points, while yields on CPI-indexed 17-year bonds rose by 0.3 percentage points. The gap between the Israeli and US government 10-year bond yields rose by 0.06 basis points since the last interest rate decision. Israel's sovereignrisk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, stood at 0.17 percent, similar to the previous month. Global background conditions: Growth in the US economy is expected to reach 2.2 percent this year, and inflation is expected to be 2.6 percent. The markets expect that the US Fed will leave the federal funds rate unchanged next month. In Europe, growth is expected to reach 2.7 percent, andinflation 2 percent. The European Central Bank, according to market assessments, is also expected to leave its interest rate unchanged next month. The main considerations behind the decision At this stage, the current level of the Bank of Israel interest rate is consistent with bringing the rate of inflation back to within the target range by the endof 2007, assuming that the exchange rate remains around its current level.In any case, interest policy will be to act, under the circumstances, suchthat inflation stays within its range, in the future too. Against a background of this year's economic growth and that expected next year, according to econometric models, local prices continue to rise by the rapid rateof more than 3 percent. However, at this stage, there are no signs of inflationary pressures. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. 25.6.07 The Bank of Israel interest rate remains unchanged for July 2007 at 3.5 percent. The Bank of Israel interest rate remains unchanged for July 2007 at 3.5 percent. The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for July 2007 will remain unchanged at 3.5 percent.

Romania,2007-06-25,"In its meeting of June 25, 2007, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR reiterates that it will continue to vigilantly monitor developments in macroeconomic indicators and their outlook in order to ensure that monetary conditions are in line with the achievement of medium-term disinflation objectives and to consolidate the convergence process with the European Union, relying also on the support from other components of the macroeconomic policy mix. The analysis of the most recent trends in macroeconomic indicators shows a continuation of the disinflation process, a relatively slower economic growth and a widening of the current account deficit against the background of persistently high dynamics of domestic absorption. Wage dynamics has stayed high while the labour market has tightened. The monetary area has registered a marginal slowdown in the pace of nongovernment credit expansion, with a tempering of leu-denominated credit dynamics and a faster pace of foreign currency lending growth. Annual inflation stood at 3.81 percent in May, lower than 4.87 percent last December. The mild increase of inflation in May compared to the previous month was triggered by adjustments in state-controlled rental tariffs and increased volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, fuels), but its level is consistent with the aim of attaining the medium-term inflation objectives. Core inflation, adjusted for the effects of excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol, has fallen further to 2.7 percent in May from 2.8 percent in April and 3.0 percent in December 2006. The drop in core inflation shows that broad monetary conditions have remained restrictive in the context of the recent adjustment of the levels of monetary policy instruments, of more pronounced leu appreciation and of maintained minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 7.0 percent per annum from 7.25 percent, to pursue an adequate control of liquidity via open-market operations in line with money market conditions and to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. Although disinflation continued, risks related to wage rises, a procyclical fiscal policy and to wider external imbalances require the maintenance of a prudent monetary policy stance. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled."
Poland,2007-06-27,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 27 June 2007 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 26-27 June 2007 The Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point to the level: reference rate 4.50 % on an annual basis; lombard rate 6.00 % on an annual basis; deposit rate 3.00 % on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.75 % on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of strong growth encompassing all its sectors. The data released since the last meeting of the Council confirm previous assessments that strong economic activity should be sustained for at least next few quarters, even though economic growth in the next quarters will be most probably slightly lower than in 2007 Q1. The continuation of fast economic growth in Poland will be supported by strong activity in the world economy and, particularly, the consolidating recovery in the euro area, which is taking place in the conditions of stable inflation. In May the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland amounted to 2.3%, and hence it was close to the NBP's inflation target of 2.5% for another consecutive month. In the Council's assessment in 2007 Q3 inflation may temporarily fall below its present level. In the Council's assessment, in the next quarters economic growth will most probably continue to exceed the growth of potential GDP. The latest information on labour market developments points to a continuation of high wage growth and a deterioration in the relation between wage and labour productivity growth. A further build-up of wage pressure and, consequently, inflationary pressure is possible. The Council assessed that in the medium term inflation increase may be constrained by a continuation of high productivity growth, very good financial results of enterprises and still low growth of external prices, related to globalisation and the ensuing intensified competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services. However, in the Council's assessment, the impact of those factors would be insufficient to keep inflation at the target level over the monetary policy transmission horizon. Therefore, the Council assessed the probability of inflation running above the inflation target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running below the target and decided to increase the NBP interest rates. In the coming months, the Council will be closely monitoring the growth and the structure of domestic demand, including the degree of the expansionary fiscal policy stance, the relation between wage and labour productivity growth, zloty exchange rate and the impact of globalisation on the economy."
Euroarea,2007-07-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our previous meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in June. It has also confirmed that the medium-term outlook for price stability remains subject to upside risks. Given the positive economic environment in the euro area, our monetary policy is still on the accommodative side, with overall financing conditions favourable, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample. Looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest data and survey releases have remained broadly positive, supporting the view that economic activity in the euro area in the second quarter of 2007 continued to expand at solid rates in line with our baseline scenario. Looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic activity remains favourable. The conditions are in place for the euro area economy to continue to grow at a sustained rate. As regards the external environment, global economic growth has become more balanced across regions and, while moderating somewhat, remains robust. External conditions thus continue to provide support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from overall financing conditions which remain favourable, accumulated and ongoing strong corporate earnings, balance sheet restructuring as well as business efficiency gains achieved over an extended period. Meanwhile, consumption should be supported by developments in real disposable income, as labour market conditions continue to improve. The risks surrounding this favourable outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. At medium to longer horizons, the balance of risks remains on the downside, owing mainly to external factors. These relate in particular to fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, the possibility of further increases in oil prices, concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances and potential shifts in financial market sentiment. As regards price developments, as reflected in Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 1.9% in June 2007, unchanged from previous months. Looking ahead, the short-term profile of annual inflation rates continues to be determined largely by current and past energy price developments, as last year's volatility in energy prices leads to significant base effects. On the basis of the current level of oil prices and oil price futures, which show an upward slope, annual inflation rates are likely to fall only slightly in the months ahead before rising again significantly towards the end of the year. At the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, risks to the outlook for price stability remain on the upside. In particular, as capacity utilisation in the euro area economy is high and labour markets continue to improve, constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to stronger than expected wage developments. In addition, pricing power in market segments with low competition may increase in such an environment. Such developments would pose significant upward risks to price stability. It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities. Wage agreements in particular should be sufficiently differentiated to take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies and sector-specific productivity developments. The Governing Council stresses the importance of avoiding wage developments that would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and harm the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. In addition, upside risks to price stability arise from increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those anticipated thus far, and the potentially procyclical stance of fiscal policy in some countries. Finally, on the external side, upside risks stem from the possibility of further unexpected oil price rises. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. The underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong, in a context of already ample liquidity. The ongoing strength of monetary expansion is reflected in the continued rapid growth of M3, which increased at an annual rate of 10.7% in May, as well as the still high level of credit growth. The strong rate of monetary and credit expansion reflects, in part, favourable financing conditions and solid economic growth. When identifying and assessing the policy-relevant underlying trends in monetary and credit expansion, it is important to look through shorter-term volatility and the effects of changes in the slope of the yield curve and external factors that are likely to prove temporary. Taking this perspective, there are several indications that higher short-term interest rates are now influencing monetary dynamics, although they have not, as yet, significantly dampened the overall strength of the underlying rate of monetary and credit expansion. For example, increases in short-term rates have contributed to a more moderate expansion of the narrow aggregate. M1, in recent quarters. Equally, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has shown some signs of stabilising since mid-2006, albeit at double-digit levels. The stabilisation of loan growth is now becoming more broad-based, and is apparent in borrowing by both non-financial corporations and households. In the latter case, the stabilisation of loan growth also reflects some moderation in house price dynamics, although house price growth nonetheless remains at high levels on average in the euro area. Given the continued vigour of money and credit expansion, there are clear indications of upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area remains ample. In this environment, monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of the expansion in economic activity and still strong property market developments. To sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look beyond any short-term volatility in inflation rates. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability remain on the upside, relating in particular to the domestic side. As capacity utilisation is high and labour markets continue to improve, constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to stronger than expected wage and profit margin developments. Given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. Accordingly, the Governing Council will monitor closely all developments in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term remains warranted. As regards fiscal policy, the Governing Council notes with concern the pressures emerging in a number of countries to relax previous fiscal consolidation targets. In the current overall benign economic environment, it is imperative that all governments comply with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact on fiscal consolidation in economic “good times” and that all the countries concerned honour the commitments they made at the Eurogroup meeting in Berlin on 20 April 2007. As agreed in Berlin, taking advantage of the favourable cyclical conditions would enable most euro area countries to achieve their medium-term objectives in 2008 or 2009, and all of them should aim for 2010 at the latest. These pledges should be reflected in the 2008 budget plans so as to avoid repeating governments' past failure to adjust fiscal balances in economic “good times”. At the same time, the Governing Council welcomes the emphasis placed by the ECOFIN Council on measures to improve the quality and efficiency of public finances. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council fully supports all measures that improve the functioning of product, labour and financial markets. In the context of the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs, the EU Member States noted that a well-functioning Internal Market remains at the heart of the Lisbon agenda and that its four freedoms will reinforce the European Union's competitiveness. The completion of the Single Market is therefore a priority for Member States, in particular as regards further financial market integration, the pursuit of effective competition in the energy market and the implementation of the Services Directive. Increased market competition and a reduction of cross-border barriers are beneficial for consumers since they lead to lower prices and a greater choice of products. For firms, they lead to higher efficiency, greater dynamism and an enhanced capacity to cope with economic shocks and to face the challenges and opportunities posed by globalisation. Following the principle of “an open market economy with free competition” is pivotal to fostering long-term economic growth and job creation, increasing the resilience of the euro area to economic shocks and facilitating the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. This was confirmed at the last European Council meeting, when the EU leaders agreed to annex a new protocol to the Treaties, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference. This protocol underlines the fact that an Internal Market which includes a system ensuring that competition is not distorted is indeed indispensable for the good functioning of the EU economies."
Egypt,2007-07-05,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release July 5, 2007 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 875 percent per annu. In its meeting held on July 5, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 875 percent and 1075 percent, respectivel. The annual headline CPI inflation eased further in May 2007, recording 10 percent (y/y) compared to 128 percent (y/y) in March 200. This trend underpins the MPC's view that the annual headline CPI may have reached its pea. This has come about as the base effect from last year's administered price adjustments and part of the avian flu shock continued to level of. The annual headline inflation rates are expected to maintain this downward trend as the base effect from the previous price increases related to the supply shocks completely dissipat. On the other hand, inflationary demand pressures from the current economic growth remain a concer. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Philippines,2007-07-11,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain a neutral monetary policy stance by implementing two complementary moves. Effective Friday, 13 July 2007, the tiering system on placements with the BSP will be lifted and the BSP's key policy interest rates will be adjusted to 6.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 8.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The removal of the tiering scheme and the adjustment in interest rates will also apply to placements in the special deposit account (SDA) facility of the BSP. This policy stance—which is neutral relative to future inflation and output—is consistent with the forward-looking orientation of inflation targeting, considering the low actual inflation and, more importantly, the benign inflation outlook over the policy horizon. The latest BSP forecasts continue to indicate that inflation is likely to fall below the 4.05.0 percent target range in 2007 and stay within the 4.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point target in 2008. In its assessment of economic conditions, the Monetary Board noted that recent data suggest that the additional liquidity management measures implemented in early May 2007 have begun to exert the desired cooling effect on liquidity conditions. Meanwhile, there are indications that the tiering scheme that has been in effect for the past eight months has had a beneficial impact on bank lending to the productive sectors of the economy. At the same time, the Monetary Board observed that the continued broadening of financial markets means that non-bank sources of financing are becoming increasingly available to the corporate sector, therefore reducing the reliance on bank lending. The Monetary Board believes that the neutral stance of monetary policy is appropriate given moderate demand pressures, favorable supply conditions and manageable inflation expectations. Moreover, the Monetary Board considers that neutrality will provide greater flexibility to the monetary authorities in the absence of a clearer direction on potential risks to the inflation outlook, such as liquidity, wage pressures and oil prices. The BSP will continue to be closely attentive to price developments and related risks with a view to formulating pre-emptive monetary policy that will safeguard price stability. This will ensure that a low-inflation environment supportive of healthy and strong economic growth is sustained over the policy horizon."
Chile,2007-07-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 12 July 2007 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.25% (annual). This decision is consistent with less slack than foreseen in the last Monetary Policy Report, and is necessary to ensure that inflation projected around two years ahead will stand at 3%. The external scenario relevant to the Chilean economy remains favorable. World economic activity is expanding strongly, financial conditions are still good and the copper price has increased once again, but so have the prices of oil and its derivatives. The prices of several food products continue to be high and some have increase even further. Beyond the performance of some specific sectors, information available on domestic output and expenditure continues to show significant dynamism in the second quarter, above early projections. Salaried employment continues on the rise and internal financial conditions are favorable. CPI inflation is slightly above 3%, exceeding forecasts in the last Monetary Policy Report, and continues to be influenced by fuel prices and by the higher price of foods: The latter have also raised core CPIX1 inflation (that excludes fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities). Beyond the increases in these specific prices, alternative measures of trend inflation stand at, or somewhat above, 3%, while labor costs remain well contained. In this scenario of higher inflation because of a supply shock, although short-term inflation expectations have risen, long-term expectations remain well anchored around 3%. The Board believes that, in the most likely scenario, it will be necessary to reduce the monetary stimulus in coming months in order for projected inflation over the policy horizon to be at 3%. As usual, the materialization of changes in the monetary policy interest rate will depend on incoming information and its implications on projected inflation. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2007-07-12,"The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) by 25 basis points, from 4.50% to 4.75%. The domestic economy seems likely to maintain its upward trend. While exports continue to post robust growth, investment and private consumption are increasing steadily. Consumer price inflation remains stable due mainly to the decline in agricultural and marine product prices, which has counteracted the run-up in international oil prices. The upward pace of real estate prices has slowed down significantly. In the financial markets, there is ample liquidity and financial institutions' lending has increased sharply, led by loans to small and medium-sized enterprises. The Committee judges that the upwardly-adjusted call rate target would still be supportive of ongoing economic recovery."
Turkiye,2007-07-12,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided to keep short-term interest rates (policy rates) unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 17.50 percent, and lending rate at 22.50 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. at 13.50 percent, lending rate at 25.50 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 21.50 percent. While the developments in energy and food prices, public expenditures, and external demand since the last quarter of 2006 restrain the disinflation process, domestic demand and inflation continue to decelerate owing to the lagged effects of strong monetary tightening. These developments are broadly in line with the April Inflation Report. Therefore, adhering to the outlook presented in the Report, the Committee envisions a measured easing starting from the last quarter of 2007. The exact timing and extent of the easing will depend on the incoming information regarding external demand, public expenditures and other determinants of medium term inflation outlook. Moreover, considering the current levels of liquidity, the Committee assessed that the Central Bank Liquidity Billsin addition to the current tools used in open market operations—could be used to enhance the effectiveness of liquidity management when necessary.

Peru,2007-07-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2007 BCRP RAISES REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 4.50% TO 4.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) approved to raise the interbank reference rate from 4.50 to 4.75 percent. This preventive measure was adopted considering the lags with which monetary policy operates and in order to continue maintaining expectations anchored at low inflation levels, given the robust growth observed in terms of domestic demand. The Board will continue to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, differentiating the factors that have temporary impacts from those with permanent effects. Moreover, given current macroeconomic data, the Board considers that this adjustment in the reference interest rate does not imply the beginning of a sequence of interest rate rises. The Board analyzed recent macroeconomic developments and prospects based on data for the last month, including the following: The Consumer Price Index for Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.47 percent in June and accumulated 1.5 percent over the last 12 months, as a result of which inflation is again within the target range. The evolution of inflation in June was influenced by rises in the prices of fuel and some food products, such as chicken meat. Like in previous episodes (first months of 2004 and 2006), these rises due to supply-related factors have a one time impact on inflation and, therefore, generate a transitory impact on the average growth of prices. On the other hand, last 12-month core inflation indicator of the price trend increased from 1.5 percent in May to 1.7 percent in June. Annual inflation during the first months of the year was below 1.0 percent and started converging towards the 2.0 percent target since May. Inflation is expected to continue this process, thus reverting the price corrections observed since May last year, in line with the forecasts of our last Inflation Report of May. Non-financial companies expect inflation to be at 1.5 percent in 2007, while the expectations of financial entities and economic analysts are in line with the 2.0 percent inflation target. Domestic demand continues to show a high dynamism, growing at an estimated rate of 10.6 percent. The most dynamic components were private consumption and private investment (which grew 7.4 percent and 20.1 percent respectively). The average monthly interest rate in the interbank market was 4.52 percent in June. Short-term rates are relatively stable; thus, the average 90-day corporate prime rate in soles was 5.20 percent in June, a similar rate to that of May. However, due to the recent upward trend of international interest rates, an increase has been observed in the yield on the 20-year sovereign bond in soles which closed at 6.15 percent in June, a level 14 bps. higher than at end-May. The General Index at the Lima Stock Exchange increased 11.1 percent in June. On the other hand, in May, last 12-month credit to the private sector grew 17.5 percent (17.6 percent in April) and 41.8 percent in the case of credit in domestic currency (39.4 percent in April). In June, the nuevo sol nominally depreciated on average 0.08 percent against the dollar, closing at 3.168 per dollar. This evolution was mainly associated with a reduction in the net balance of forwards for a total of US$ 518 million. In this context, the Central Bank purchased US$ 371 million in the exchange market, amount that was 78 percent lower than the one purchased in May. During the session, the Board approved the annual interest rates on the following active and passive operations in soles between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.50 percent. Overnight deposits: 4.00 percent. Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the interest rates on the following operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage point. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.50 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 3.25 percent. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (August 2007) in the session to be held on August 2, 2007."
Thailand,2007-07-18,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 18 July 2007 Ms. Suchada Kirakul. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. In the first quarter of 2007, domestic demand slowed down by more than expected. While private consumption and investment showed signs of a slight improvement in April and May, fragility remained, given that consumer confidence stayed at a low level. Despite higher global oil prices, inflation in the first half of the year was lower than expected, due to the appreciation of the baht and private spending that had yet to fully recover. The MPC viewed that risks to growth remained, particularly in private expenditure, which still required support for a continued recovery. Risks to inflation moderated, and core inflation was expected to remain within the target range for the next 8 quarters. Monetary policy could therefore be eased further to facilitate economic adjustment and to facilitate economic expansion without exerting pressure on inflation. The MPC therefore decided to lower the 1-day repurchase rate by 025 per cent from 350 per cent per annum to 325 per cent per annum, effective today."
Israel,2007-07-23,"23.7.07 The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for August 2007 by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for August 2007 willrise by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent. This is consistent with the policy of maintaining price stability, as expressed by the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose in June by 0.7 percent, above forecasts that had predicted, on average, a rise of 0.4 percent. In the last twelve months the CPI has fallen by 0.7 percent, a rate of inflation that is still significantly below the lower boundary of the target inflation range. However, since the beginning of the year prices have risen by 1 percent (in annual terms, at a rate of 2 percent per year), which is the midpoint of the target inflation range. According to the Bank of Israel'seconometric models, in the past 12 months local prices have risen at a rate in excess of the upper boundary of the target inflation range. The rapid pass-through between changes in the exchange rate and inflation in Israel and the volatility of the exchange rate, which has increased of late, leads to large fluctuations in the monthly CPI figures. Forecasts: After the publication of June CPI data, local forecasters revised their forecasts upward, and they now expect, on average, an inflation rate of 2.7 percent for both 2007 and for the next twelve months. At the same time, they expect that the Bank of Israel will raise the interest rate further this year, and that in a year's time it will stand at 4.2 percent. The expectation of inflation over the next 12 months, as derived from the capital markets--the difference between the yield to maturityof unindexed bonds and the yield to maturity of indexed bonds--stands at 1.9 percent, close to the midpoint of the target range. Themarket also expects that the interest rate will rise by 40 basis points in the next 12 months. The Bank of Israel's econometric models also imply that inflation will lie within the target range in 2007-2008, with a rise in the interest rate before the end of the year. Real economic activity: The Bank of Israel Companies Survey for the second quarter shows that the growth trend in the economy continued in the second quarter and is expected to continue in the third quarter, further to therapid growth seen in the first quarter of the year. The composite state-of-the-economy index that rose in June by 0.7 percent, including a revision upward of earlier indices, supports the assessment that the expansion of economic activity will continue. Labor market and wages: The rise in real activity has been accompanied by an increase in the number of people employed in most principal industriesof the economy, and by a moderate rise in wages, against a background of afurther slowdown in the increase in labor productivity. In the past year, wages in the private sector have risen faster than in the public sector, though negotiations on public sector wage agreements are currently in progress. Budgetary policy: Government spending in the first half of the year together with the higher income from taxes are expected to lead to a budget deficit of about 1.5 percent of GDP in 2007. Recent decisions involving government expenditures imply a rise in government spending in the coming years; hence it will be difficult for the government to meet its budgetary framework in the coming years. Forex market: Since the previous interest rate decision (on June 25) up till July 22, the shekel strengthened by 0.6 percent against the dollar andweakened by 1.9 percent against the euro, while other currencies strengthened against the dollar by more than 2 percent. Despite these developments, the underlying forces supporting the value of the shekel--mostly the surplus in the current account of the balance of payments and foreign investment in the economy--continue. Capital market: Since the previous interest rate decision (on June 25) up till July 22, the TA 100 index rose by 3.2 percent, while stock markets inmost of the developed markets remained stable and those in the developing markets registered rises of more than 2 percent. In the same period, yieldsto maturity on unindexed and indexed 10-year bonds have remained steady at 5.5 percent, and 3.1 percent respectively. The gap between yields on 10-year unindexed bonds in Israel and in the US reached 0.6 percentage points, compared to a gap of 0.5 percentage points prior to the previous interest rate decision. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, stands at 0.17 percent, similar to previous months. Global background conditions: Global economic activity remains firm. Global inflation remains relatively mild. However, the rise in the prices of oil and of basic food products, together with the contracting output gap in the developed countries, raises the fear of a rise in inflation. Against this background, the probability has risen that many central banks will continue the process of raising interest rates. The main considerations behind the decision C 2A 8 ; The continued rapid growth of the economy, which is expected to continue, and with it the further contraction in the output gap, signal a tendency to higher inflation. C 2A 8 ; After the publication of the June CPI figure--a rise of 0.7 percent--inflation expectations from the capital market, from forecasters, and from the Bank of Israel's econometric models, increased. The expectations are that in 2007 inflation will be around the midpoint of the target range, while in 12 months time, inflation will be above the midpoint. These inflation expectations include an expectation that the Bank of Israel interest rate will rise by the end of 2007. C 2A 8 ; Recently the expectation of a rise in the global inflation rate--particularly in the prices of oil and basicfoods--has increased, and this will affect import prices in Israel. C 2A 8 ; In addition, against this background, many countries are continuing a process of raising interest rates. The positive interest rate gap between other countries and Israel affects the movement of short-term capital and thus the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. 23.7.07 The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for August 2007 by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent.

Malaysia,2007-07-24,"At its meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. The overall growth of the Malaysian economy in the first half of the year has remained favourable with the slower growth in the external sector being balanced by stronger growth in domestic demand. During the second half of 2007, the growth momentum of the economy is expected to strengthen. Recent trade data suggest that the sustained growth in Malaysia's major trading partner economies is starting to provide support to export growth. This will complement the robust growth in both domestic consumption and investment that is expected to be sustained for the rest of the year. Inflation moderated in the first half of 2007 to a level of 1.4% in June and averaged 2% for the period as a whole. During the second half of 2007, inflation may edge up due to both domestic and external factors, but the average rate of inflation for 2007 is expected to be at the lower end of the projected range of 2-2.5 percent. The future stance of monetary policy would be determined by Bank Negara Malaysia 's assessment of new data and information and their implications on the medium-term prospects for price stability and economic growth.

Poland,2007-07-25,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 25 July 2007 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 24-25 July 2007 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 4.50% on an annual basis; lombard rate 6.00% on an annual basis; deposit rate 3.00% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.75% on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of strong growth encompassing all its sectors. The data released since the last meeting of the Council confirm previous assessments that strong economic activity should be sustained for at least next few quarters, even though economic growth will be most probably slightly lower than in 2007 Q1. The continuation of fast economic growth in Poland will be supported by strong activity in the world economy and, particularly, the consolidating recovery in the euro area in the conditions of stable inflation. In June the annual growth rate of consumer prices in Poland amounted to 2.6%, and hence it was close to the NBP's inflation target of 2.5% for another consecutive month. The Council expects that in 2007 Q3 inflation may temporarily fall below its present level. The Council got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by NBP staff and based on the ECMOD model, which is one of the inputs to the Council's decision-making process on NBP interest rates. According to the July inflation projection, in the horizon of eight quarters, the growth rate of consumer prices will be higher than in the April projection. Under constant interest rates, there is a 50-percent probability that inflation will remain within the range of 2.3-3.3% in 2007 Q4 (compared with 1.3-2.6% in the April projection), 2.1-4.1% in 2008 Q4 (compared with 1.6-3.8%) and 2.1-4.5% in 2009 Q4 (compared with 2.1-4.6%). According to the July ECMOD-based projection, the annual GDP growth rate will remain with a 50-percent probability within the range of 6.2-6.8% in 2007 (compared with 6.0-7.0% in the April projection), 4.3-6.7% in 2008 (compared with 4.0-6.3%) and 4.0-7.2% in 2009 (compared with 4.0-7.0%). The Council also got acquainted with other forecasts conducted at the NBP. In the Council's assessment, in the coming quarters, economic growth will most probably continue to exceed the growth of potential GDP. The latest information on labour market developments point to a continuation of a high wage growth and a deterioration in the relation between wage and labour productivity growth. A further build-up in wage pressure and, consequently, inflationary pressure is possible. Nevertheless, the Council assessed that the mid-term inflation growth may be curbed by increase in productivity and a very good financial standing of ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, enterprises. Inflation growth in the medium term may also be constrained by low growth of external prices, related to the monetary policy pursued by major central banks as well as the globalisation process and the ensuing rise in competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services. In the Council's assessment, in the medium term the probability of inflation running above the inflation target decreased to a certain degree due to the previously implemented monetary policy tightening, though it is still higher than the probability of inflation running below the target. A more comprehensive assessment of the scale of the risk of inflation overshooting the inflation target will only be possible after analysing the data released in the future. In the months to come, the Council will be closely monitoring the growth and structure of domestic demand, including the degree of the expansionary fiscal policy stance, the relation between wage and labour productivity growth, zloty exchange rate and the impact of globalisation processes on the economy."

India,2007-07-31,"First Quarter Review of the Annual Policy Statement on Monetary Policy for the Year 2007-08 RBI Governor presented the First Quarter Review of Annual Statement on Monetary Policy for the Year 2007-08 today. Highlights Bank Rate kept unchanged. Reverse Repo Rate and Repo Rate under LAF kept unchanged. Withdrawal of the ceiling of Rs. 3,000 crore on daily reverse repo under the LAF with effect from Monday. August 6, 2007.

GDP growth projection for 2007-08 retained at around 8.5 per cent, barring domestic or external shocks. Holding inflation within 5.0 per cent in 2007-08 assumes priority in the policy hierarchy, while reinforcing the medium-term objective to condition policy and perceptions to reduce inflation to 4.0- 4.5 per cent on a sustained basis. While non-food credit growth has decelerated, the acceleration in money supply and reserve money warrants an appropriate response. Recent financial market developments in India and potential uncertainties in global markets warrant a higher priority in the policy hierarchy for managing appropriate liquidity conditions at the current juncture. Barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy including the outlook for inflation, the overall stance of monetary policy in the period ahead will broadly continue to be: To reinforce the emphasis on price stability and well-anchored inflation expectations while ensuring a monetary and interest rate environment that supports export and investment demand in the economy so as to enable continuation of the growth momentum. To re-emphasise credit quality and orderly conditions in financial markets for securing macroeconomic and, in particular, financial stability while simultaneously pursuing greater credit penetration and financial inclusion. To respond swiftly with all possible measures as appropriate to the evolving global and domestic situation impinging on inflation expectations, financial stability and the growth momentum.2007-08.

Domestic Developments Real GDP growth during the quarter January-March 2007 is placed at 9.1 per cent as against 10.0 per cent in the corresponding quarter a year ago and real GDP growth for the year 2006-07 is revised upwards from 9.2 per cent to 9.4 per cent. Inflation, measured by variations in the wholesale price index (WPI) on a year-on-year basis, declined from 5.9 per cent at end-March 2007 to 4.4 per cent as on July 14, 2007. The average international price of the Indian crude oil basket increased from US $ 56.2 per barrel in January-March 2007 to US $ 66.2 per barrel in April-June 2007 and to around US $ 73.5 per barrel on July 27, 2007. Growth in money supply (M3) at 21.6 per cent on a year-on-year basis on July 6, 2007 was above the projected trajectory of 17.0-17.5 per cent indicated in the Annual Policy Statement for 2007-08 and higher than 19.0 per cent a year ago. The year-on-year increase in aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) at 24.4 per cent (Rs.5,31,881 crore) up to July 6, 2007 was higher than 20.9 per cent (Rs.3,77, 392 crore) a year ago. The year-on-year non-food credit growth of SCBs at 24.4 per cent (Rs.3,67,258 crore) on July 6, 2007 was lower than 32.8 per cent (Rs.3,70,899 crore) a year ago. The total overhang of liquidity under the LAF, the MSS and cash balances of the Central Government taken together declined from an average of Rs.97,449 crore in March 2007 to Rs.72,823 crore on July 27, 2007. An assessment of the total liquidity overhang, however, should also reflect the transfer of Rs.35,351 crore from the Central Government to the Reserve Bank during this period on account of transfer of shares from the Reserve Bank to the Central Government. During the first quarter of 2007-08, financial markets experienced sizeable fluctuations in liquidity and attendant episodes of volatility in the money market with overnight rates in the call, market repo and collateralised borrowing and lending obligations (CBLO) segments displaying close co-movement. Banks had generally increased their deposit rates by about 25-50 basis points across various maturities between March 2007 and June 2007, but reduced them during July 2007, especially in the shorter maturities. The majority of public sector banks (PSBs) adjusted their deposit rates upwards by10-25 basis points on maturities above one year, particularly at the longer end. By the beginning of the current financial year, several banks had drawn down holdings of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR)-eligible securities close to the statutory floor. Exclusive of liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) operations, however, banks' investments in Government and other approved securities increased by Rs.27,331 crore during the current year so far (up to July 6,2007) as compared with an increase of Rs.751 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. Gross market borrowings (dated securities and 364-day Treasury Bills) of the Central Government during 2007-08 at Rs.85,628 crore up to July 27, 2007 (Rs.70,813 crore a year ago) constituted 45.4 per cent of the budget estimates while net market borrowings at Rs.46,047 crore (Rs.34,822 crore) constituted 42.0 per cent of the budget estimates.33.0 per cent as compared with 16.9 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. Non-POL imports rose by 47.3 per cent whereas oil imports remained broadly stable at the level recorded a year ago. As a result, the merchandise trade deficit widened to US $ 13.3 billion during April-May 2007 from US $ 8.2 billion in April-May 2006. As on July 20, 2007 India's foreign exchange reserves increased by US $ 22.9 billion over their end-March 2007 level to US $ 222.0 billion. During April-June 2007, the rupee appreciated by 6.63 per cent against the US dollar, by 5.19 per cent against the euro, by 4.41 per cent against the pound sterling and by 10.44 per cent against the Japanese yen. Global Developments According to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released in April 2007, global real GDP growth was expected to decline from 5.4 per cent in 2006 to 4.9 per cent in 2007 and 2008. The update of the WEO released in July 2007 has revised this estimate upwards to 5.5 per cent for 2006 and its forecast for 2007 and 2008 to 5.2 per cent. Globally, headline inflation has picked up in the wake of increase in commodity prices and core inflation has also generally remained firm. The inflation outlook remains a matter of concern on account of energy and other commodity prices, increased capacity utilisation rates in developed and major emerging economies and the impact of rising wages on inflation in advanced industrial economies. Perceptions of inflation pressures ahead have prompted monetary authorities generally to persevere in withdrawing monetary accommodation. The central banks that have tightened their policy rates include the ECB; the Bank of England; the Bank of Japan; the Bank of Canada; the Reserve Bank of Australia; the Reserve Bank of New Zealand; the People's Bank of China; the Bank of Korea; the Banco de Mexico; and the Banco Central de Chile.Some central banks, such as China and Korea, have used supplementary measures for tightening, besides increasing the key policy rates such as increases in reserve requirements. In the first half of 2007, emerging markets outperformed stocks in developed markets. Foreign investor demand for emerging market assets was reflected in a broad-based rise in inflows into dedicated bond and equity markets of the EMEs. Emerging market corporate bond issuance in international bond markets rose to a record level in 2006. The exposure of emerging markets to risky financial assets of the mature markets has increased, and therefore, the overall global financial risks have increased.4.0-4.5 per cent on a sustained basis. For the purpose of monetary policy formulation, the Annual Policy Statement of April 2007 projected growth of money supply (M ) at around 17.0-17.5 per cent for 2007-08 in consonance 3 with the outlook on growth and inflation. Consistent with the projections of money supply, the growth in aggregate deposits in 2007-08 was placed at around Rs.4,90,000 crore while non-food credit including investments in bonds/debentures/shares of public sector undertakings and private corporate sector and commercial paper (CP) was projected to decelerate to 24.0-25.0 per cent in 2007-08 from the average of 29.8 per cent over 2004-07. While non-food credit growth hasdecelerated, the acceleration in money supply and reserve money warrants an appropriate response. The global outlook is positive with continuing prospects for strong and stable growth but there are concerns about inflationary pressures worldwide. Monetary authorities are inclined to regard the current levels of real interest rates as warranting further withdrawal of monetary accommodation and are indicating a preparedness to respond to the manner in which the inflation scenario evolves. Financial markets have been aggressively re-pricing risks; however, the wide diffusion of risks and the abundance of liquidity have imparted considerable uncertainty. These developments are necessitating intensified policy monitoring with a policy preference for insulating domestic real activity from these shocks. Monetary policy in India would continue to be vigilant and pro-active in the context of any accentuation of global uncertainties that pose threats to growth and stability in the domestic economy. The domestic outlook continues to be favourable and would dominate the dynamic setting of monetary policy in the period ahead. It is important to design monetary policy such that it protects growth by contributing to the maintenance of stability. Accordingly, while the stance of monetary policy would continue to reinforce the emphasis on price stability and well-anchored inflation expectations and thereby sustain the growth momentum, contextually, financial stability may assume greater importance in the months to come. Recent developments in financial markets in India and potential uncertainties in global markets warrant a higher priority for managing appropriate liquidity conditions in the policy hierarchy at the current juncture. The Reserve Bank will continue with its policy of active demand management of liquidity through appropriate use of the CRR stipulations and open market operations (OMO) including the MSS and LAF, using all the policy instruments at its disposal flexibly, as and when the situation warrants. Barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy including the outlook for inflation, the overall stance of monetary policy in the period ahead will broadly continue to be: To reinforce the emphasis on price stability and well-anchored inflation expectations while ensuring a monetary and interest rate environment that supports export and investment demand in the economy so as to enable continuation of the growth momentum. To re-emphasise credit quality and orderly conditions in financial markets for securing macroeconomic and, in particular, financial stability while simultaneously pursuing greater credit penetration and financial inclusion. To respond swiftly with all possible measures as appropriate to the evolving global and domestic situation impinging on inflation expectations, financial stability and the growth momentum.6.0 per cent. Reverse Repo Rate and Repo Rate under LAF kept unchanged at 6.00 per cent and 7.75 per cent, respectively. In view of the current macroeconomic and overall monetary and liquidity conditions, it has been decided to withdraw the ceiling of Rs. 3,000 crore on daily reverse repo under the LAF with effect from Monday. August 6, 2007. The Reserve Bank, however, retains the discretion to re- impose a ceiling as appropriate and has the flexibility to conduct repo/reverse repo auctions at a fixed rate or at variable rates as circumstances warrant. The Reserve Bank retains the option to conduct overnight or longer term repo/reverse repo under the LAF depending on market conditions and other relevant factors. The Reserve Bank will continue to use this flexibility including the right to accept or reject tender(s) under the LAF, wholly or partially, if deemed fit, so as to make efficient use of the LAF in daily liquidity management. The second LAF, which was introduced from November 28, 2005 and is conducted between 3.00 p.m. On a review of the current liquidity situation, it is considered desirable to increase the CRR by 50 basis points to 7.0 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning August 4, 2007. The Mid-Term Review of the Annual Policy Statement for the year 2007-08 will be undertaken on October 30, 2007. Alpana Killawala Chief General Manager Press Release :2007-2008/156."
Romania,2007-07-31,"In its meeting of July 31, 2007, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. In its meeting of July 31, 2008, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for August 6, 2007. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic environment and the inflation outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for August 4, 2008. The recent developments in macroeconomic indicators show a disinflation process consistent with the aim to attain this year's inflation target, a mild slowdown of economic growth dynamics under the negative impact from agriculture as well as a persistent widening of the current account deficit. The annual inflation rate stood at 8.61 percent in June, almost unchanged versus 8.63 percent in March 2008 but still significantly above the upper limit of the variation band around the target for this year. Moreover, the administered price increases will lead to a temporarily faster growth of annual inflation rate in July. The year-on-year inflation rate stood at 3.8 percent in June, unchanged from the previous month, consolidating its position below the 2007 target and falling from 4.87 percent in December 2006. The continued rise in incomes in excess of labour productivity gains as well as the persistently rapid pace of credit expansion have fuelled inflationary pressures, heightening also the risk of deteriorating external competitiveness. Core inflation, excluding the effects of excise duties on tobacco and alcohol, dropped further - to 2.65 percent year-on-year in June from 2.7 percent in the month before and 3.0 percent in December 2006 - as broad monetary conditions remained restrictive against the background of a more pronounced appreciation of the leu. The adjusted annual CORE2 inflation rate - calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) as well as the effect of vice tax - climbed to an annual 7.9 percent in June from 7.6 percent in the previous month, due to the persistent impact of inflationary shocks over the past 12 months, reflected also by stronger inflation expectations. In the monetary area, a relative reduction of the dynamics of the non-government credit expansion is to be noted again. Meanwhile, the money market witnessed increased volatility in the levels of liquidity and interbank rates. This situation requires an adjustment of the corridor of interest rates on the standing facilities offered by the monetary authority to credit institutions, meant also to consolidate the signaling role of the monetary policy rate for the interbank market which is a key link for the monetary signal transmission to the economy. Under these circumstances, further consolidation of monetary policy restrictiveness through an appropriate dosage of its instruments is needed, as well as stronger support from other components of the economic policy mix. In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged at 7.0 percent per annum and to reconfigure the instruments of the operational framework, with the aim of gradually aligning to European Central Bank practice. In light of available data and given the need to boost savings and alleviate fast credit growth, the NBR Board has decided to raise the monetary policy rate to 10.25 percent per annum from 10.0 percent. Therefore, the NBR Board has decided to raise the interest rate on its deposit facility to an annual 2.0 percent from 1.0 percent, to lower the interest rate on its lending facility (Lombard rate) to an annual 12.0 percent from 14.0 percent and reduce the maturity for its deposit taking open-market operations to two weeks from one month along with keeping their frequency unchanged (weekly, on Mondays). Therefore, starting from August 1, 2008 the interest rate on the NBR deposit facility is raised to an annual 6.25 percent from 6.0 percent while the rate on its lending facility (Lombard rate) will stand at an annual 14.25 percent versus 14.0 percent previously. Also, the penalty rate for deficits of leu-denominated minimum reserve requirements will rise to an annual 21.25 percent from 21 percent starting with the August 24-September 23, 2008 maintenance period. The NBR Board has also decided to cut the penalty rate for deficits of leu-denominated minimum reserves to an annual 18.0 percent from 21.0 percent starting with the August 24-September 23, 2007 maintenance period. The NBR will continue to pursue a firm management of money market liquidity via open-market operations, leaving unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. Meanwhile, the NBR Board is restating that the monetary authority will continue to pursue an adequate control of liquidity via open-market operations in line with financial market conditions and leaves unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for August 4, 2008. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic context and inflation outlook, as well as the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The inflation outlook reveals a slowdown trend in the year-on-year inflation rate starting August as a result of a base effect as well as of the maintenance of restrictive monetary conditions. Nevertheless, macroeconomic risks, especially those related to income policy and increased budget spending in the electoral period, have picked up and might be heightened by rising uncertainties surrounding the global economic environment. The medium-term inflation outlook indicates a continuation and a consolidation of disinflation. However, pressures related to an increase in incomes insufficiently supported by productivity gains, growing government spending, as well as uncertainties related to investors' attitude vis a vis emerging markets, the calendar of administered price adjustments and the impact of drought on food prices require the maintenance of a cautious monetary policy stance. In this context, the NBR Board believes it is essential that the temporary deviation of annual inflation outside the target band should not trigger any relaxation of wage and fiscal policies, considering the need to preserve the main macroeconomic equilibria. Under these circumstances, bringing inflation, in a sustainable manner, within the variation band around the target during 2009 requires the implementation of coherent and restrictive macroeconomic policies (monetary, fiscal and income) as well as stepped-up structural reforms. Following an assessment of the new forecast taking into account the need to continue disinflation in the medium term, in line with the euro adoption calendar as well as of the medium-term risks and uncertainties related to the inflation outlook, especially the factors outside the central bank's authority, the NBR Board has set the 2009 inflation target at 3.5 percent, with a target band of +/- one percentage point. The NBR Board has also made a preliminary assessment of the main parameters for setting the 2010 inflation target, taking into account the need to continue disinflation in the medium term in line with the euro adoption calendar as well as the risks and uncertainties related to the inflation performance, especially those pertaining to factors beyond the central bank's control. The 2010 target will be set and announced after the completion of consultations with the Government. The 2009 target, also assumed by the government, is in line with the need to achieve a sustainable medium-term inflation rate in the context of the ongoing convergence with the European Union - a process that requires sustained financial and economic efforts underpinned by an adequate macroeconomic policy mix. The NBR Board reaffirms that it will vigilantly monitor developments in macroeconomic indicators, standing ready to use the central bank's entire array of instruments to counteract inflationary pressures and to ensure that disinflation will resume at a pace consistent with the aim of achieving the announced medium-term inflation targets in a sustainable manner. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for August 6, 2007. Also, according to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for September 26, 2007. The next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for September 25, 2008."
Nigeria,2007-08-01,"PRESS RELEASE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 51 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. AUGUST 1, 2007 The Monetary Policy Committee of the CBN met on 1st August 2007 and decided to leave the MPR unchanged at 80 per cent 1) The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on August 1, 2007 under the chairmanship of the Governor. Professor Chukwuma C Soludo. The Committee reviewed the major macroeconomic developments and the implementation of fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies in the first half of 2007, as well as the challenges for the rest of the year. The MPC noted with satisfaction the overall macroeconomic performance in the first half of the year, as evidenced by the sustained single-digit inflation and relatively stable naira/dollar exchange rate and interest rates. The Committee, thus, restated its commitment to ensuring price and exchange rate stability through restrictive monetary policy stance for the rest of the year. Key Macroeconomic Developments 2) Inflation: Inflation stayed within single-digit in the first half of 2007. The Committee noted the rise in year-on-year (headline) inflation to 64 per cent in June 2007 from 46 per cent in May, 2007, reflecting the combined effects of the increase in food, transport and energy price indexes. Staff estimates, however, show that the year-on-year inflation would remain within single -digit for the rest of the year, despite current pressures. 3) Exchange Rate: The MPC noted with satisfaction the continued stability of the naira exchange rate in the first seven months of 2007. The exchange rate of the naira remained stable at both the wDAS and the BDCs during the period. The naira exchange rate in the wDAS appreciated from N12688/US$1 at end-March to N12605/US$1 (rate +1%) at end-June, 2007. The Committee also noted the actual and potential effects of the rising private foreign exchange inflows on the naira exchange rate. The inflows, comprising mainly foreign direct investment and portfolio investment averaged US$6746 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared with US$5000 million in the first quarter. 4) External Reserves: The Committee noted the decline in gross official reserves from $4317 billion at end-May 2007 to $4274 at end-June. Reserves stood at $429 billion at end-July, 2007 owing to increased foreign exchange sales at the wDAS. The level of reserves, the Committee noted, would cover approximately 19 months of current foreign exchange disbursements or 25 months of imports. 5) Growth in Monetary Aggregates: At the end of June, 2007, broad money grew by 109 per cent. When annualized the growth in M2 translates to 217 per cent which was higher than the 2007 target of 190 per cent. The increase 2 in M2 was driven largely by sustained increase in the foreign assets (net) of the banking system. Meanwhile in June, 2007 reserve money stood at N8584 billion which was lower than the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) programme target of N86000 billion. The drop in reserve money from the May 2007 level of N9024 billion reflected the effect of the liquidity mop-up operations towards the end of the second quarter of 2007. 6) Credit: Growth in aggregate domestic credit (net) declined by about 912 per cent at end-May, and by 3718 per cent in June 2007 relative to its level at end-December 2006. The fall in aggregate credit was attributed to the decline in credit (net) to government, which fell by about 506 per cent at end-May and by 505 per cent at end-June 2007. Meanwhile credit to the private sector grew by about 248 per cent in June 2007 which on annualized basis comes to 496 per cent, compared to the target growth of 300 per cent for the year. 7) Interest Rate Developments: The MPC noted that volatility in the inter-bank rates continued to moderate in the first half of 2007. Although the average inter-bank rate trended upward, it generally remained within the corridor defined by the Bank's Standing Facility. The Committee also noted that the spread between the average weighted deposit and maximum lending rate narrowed to 879 percentage points in the first half of 2007. With the year-on- 3 year headline inflation rate at 64 per cent in June 2007, both deposit and lending rates were positive in real terms. OUTLOOK FOR THE REST OF 2007 AND THE MPC DECISIONS The MPC noted that year-on-year headline inflation would continue to remain single digit in the third quarter of 2007, but may not return to the April level of 42 per cent, the lowest recorded in the first half of 2007. Overall a combination of stable food prices and a restrictive monetary policy stance is expected to help sustain the headline inflation within single-digit. The Committee also noted the challenges arising from rising autonomous private inflows and the challenge of further appreciation of the naira/dollar exchange rate. In addition, the Committee noted other important sources of pressure/risk to low inflation including the virement of capital vote to finance recurrent expenditure and the distribution of part of the excess crude oil account. However the forecast growth path of M2 in the rest of the year is within target if monetary policy remains on course. In the light of the above, the Committee decided to: a) Retain the MPR at 80 per cent b) Approve increased sale of financial securities to pre-emptively and proactively mitigate the impact of increased fiscal injections on system liquidity. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled to hold on October 2, 2007."
Euroarea,2007-08-02,"Trichet: Let me just say a few words and then I will be ready to respond to questions, as usual. Recent economic developments and survey indicators confirm that sustained economic growth continued in the euro area through the second quarter. Rising oil prices, emerging capacity constraints and the potential for stronger wage and cost dynamics, among other factors, imply upside risks to price stability over the medium term. The existence of upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons is confirmed by the strength of the underlying rate of monetary expansion: strong vigilance is therefore of the essence to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Both, our previous economic and monetary analysis as expressed in particular in the last press conference have been fully confirmed by the ongoing information we have received since the last meeting of the Governing Council. Let me also stress that we never pre-commit, we decide at the moment of the meeting of the Governing Council on the basis of the information that we have, facts and figures, and according to the judgement that we make at that moment. Let me also say that we are experiencing a period of market nervousness, a period where we see volatility in markets in general and re-appreciation of risks. We think that these developments in financial markets deserve attention. We will continue to pay great attention to the developments in the market over the period to come."
United States,2007-08-07,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year. Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures. Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Thomas M Hoenig; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Frederic S Mishkin; Michael H Moskow; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M Warsh."
Chile,2007-08-09,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 9 August 2007 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.5% (annual). This decision is necessary for projected inflation around two years ahead to stand at 3%. Although the external scenario relevant to the Chilean economy continues to be positive and world economic activity is still strong, risk premiums have increased, international financial markets are showing more volatility and credit conditions have become somewhat tighter. The prices of copper and oil remain high and gasoline prices have fallen. The prices of several food products remain high. Beyond the performance of some specific sectors, output data available confirms important dynamism in the second quarter, above earlier projections and above trend. Domestic demand seems to have exceeded forecasts, salaried employment continues on the rise and internal financial conditions are still favorable. CPI inflation has risen to almost 4%, much above projections in May's Monetary Policy Report. Increases in the prices of some non-perishable foods and of fuels have deepened, in combination with abnormal rises in the prices of several perishables, which are believed to be largely of temporary nature. The higher prices of non-perishable foods have also driven up core CPIX1 inflation (that excludes fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities). Alternative measures of trend inflation stand slightly above 3%, while labor costs remain well contained. In this setting of higher inflation due to various supply shocks, short-term inflation expectations have increased significantly, although for the longer-term they remain around 3%. The Board believes that, in the most likely scenario, it will be necessary to continue increasing the monetary policy rate in coming months in order for projected inflation over the policy horizon to remain at 3%. As usual, the evolution of the policy rate will depend on incoming information and its implications on projected inflation. In particular, a scenario of strong specific price shocks requires special follow-up of both a possible propagation to other prices and of medium- and long-term inflation expectations. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2007-08-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) by 25 basis points from 4.75% to 5.00%. In a related action, the Committee also raised the interest rates on both the Bank of Korea's Liquidity Adjustment Loans and Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans by 25 basis points to 4.75% and 3.25%, respectively. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) by 25 basis points, from 4.75% to 5.00%. The domestic economy seems likely to maintain its upward trend. While exports continue to post robust growth, investment and private consumption are increasing steadily. Consumer price inflation remains stable despite the rise in international oil prices. The upward trend of real estate prices seems to have been contained. In the financial markets, there is ample liquidity and financial institutions' lending continues to show a steady increase. The Committee believes that, after this action, the degree of financial accommodativeness will be markedly reduced."
Turkiye,2007-08-14,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided to keep short-term interest rates (policy rates) unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 17.50 percent, and lending rate at 22.50 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. at 13.50 percent, lending rate at 25.50 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 21.50 percent. Recent developments in economic activity and inflation are in line with the outlook presented in the July Inflation Report. While private consumption and investment demand exhibit signs of recovery, external demand moderates. Aggregate demand conditions continue to support the disinflation process. The Committee notes the favorable developments in the services inflation since the beginning of 2007. Notwithstanding the risks related to energy and food prices, inflation continues to decelerate owing to the lagged effects of strong monetary tightening. The Committee closely monitors the developments in the international liquidity conditions and the credit markets, and assesses that these developments have not changed the inflation outlook at this point. In this respect the Committee maintains the policy stance outlined in the Inflation Report, and thus envisions a measured easing starting from the last quarter of 2007. However, the exact timing and extent of the easing may vary depending on the incoming information regarding global liquidity conditions, external demand, public expenditures and other determinants of medium term inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook will lead the Committee to reconsider its stance. Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days. The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided to keep short-term interest rates (policy rates) unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 17.50 percent, and lending rate at 22.50 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. at 13.50 percent, lending rate at 25.50 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 21.50 percent.

Summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Peru,2007-08-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2007 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) approved to maintain the interbank reference rate at 4.75 percent, but expressed concerns that the rises in the international prices of fuel and in some inputs used in the production of food products might reflect in inflationary expectations. These rises have a transitory impact on inflation. The Board will continue to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, differentiating the factors that have temporary impacts from those with permanent effects. Therefore, should expectations about inflation increase or should domestic demand increase to a level exceeding the gains resulting from productivity, the BCRP will implement additional preventive adjustments in the reference interest rate. The Board analyzed the following macroeconomic information: The Consumer Price Index for Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.48 percent in July and accumulated 2.2 percent over the last 12 months, within the target range (2 percent, plus or minus one percentage point). Last 12-month core inflation indicator of the inflation trend was 1.9 percent, below the 2 percent inflation target. Inflation expectations for this year, as reflected in the surveys carried out with economic analysts and financial entities at the end of July, continue to be anchored to the 2 percent monetary inflation target. The rate of inflation in the last three months was mainly influenced by rises in the international prices of inputs for the production of food products, such as soy bean (10.7 percent) and wheat (27.6 percent), as well as rises in the international prices of fuel (19.0 percent). These rises should not have a permanent and generalized impact on the overall prices of the consumer basket as long as expectations continue to be anchored to the inflation target. Economic activity continues to show a robust growth: GDP is expected to grow 7.7 percent in the second quarter and domestic demand is expected to grow 10.3 percent in the same period. The nuevo sol appreciated 0.3 percent against the dollar in July, reaching an average exchange rate of 3.161 per dollar. On the other hand, the nuevo sol depreciated 0.5 percent against the currency basket of our trading partners, mainly due to the weakening of the dollar against other currencies. Therefore, in real terms the nuevo sol depreciated 0.3 percent. The average monthly interest rate in the interbank market was 4.69 percent in July. Short-term rates increased following the rise of the reference interest rate to 4.75 percent on July Thus, the average 90-day corporate prime rate in soles was 5.3 percent, 10 basis points higher than at end June. Due to the volatility seen in international financial markets in the last days of July, an increase was observed in the yield on the 20-year sovereign bond in soles which closed at 6.65 percent in July, a level 50 bps. higher than at end June. Moreover, 30-year sovereign bonds were issued for the first time in July. The yield on these bonds was 6.83 percent at the close of the month. During the session, the Board approved the annual interest rates on the following active and passive operations in soles between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.50 percent. Overnight deposits: 4 percent. Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the interest rates on the following operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage point. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.50 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 3.25 percent. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (September 2007) in the session to be held on September 6, 2007. Furthermore, the following Inflation Report will be published on October 5."
Egypt,2007-08-16,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release August 16, 2007 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 875 percent per annu. In its meeting held on August 16, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 875 percent and 1075 percent, respectivel. The annual headline CPI inflation fell for the fourth month in a row, registering 8 percent (y/y) in July compared to 10 percent and 846 percent in May and June, respectivel. This was largely driven by the continued phasing out of last year's supply shock. Looking forward, inflation is expected to moderate further over the coming month. Nonetheless inflationary demand pressures from the current economic growth remain a concer. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation and the recent developments in international financial markets, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

South Africa,2007-08-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee met and evaluated domestic and international economic developments as well as the prospects for inflation going forward. In this context the MPC noted that recent financial market developments in some of the developed economies have had spill-over effects on emerging markets including South Africa. A number of central banks have responded by injecting significant amounts of liquidity into their banking systems in order to ensure an orderly adjustment to the liquidity squeeze that was being experienced. The focus of the South African Reserve Bank remains to ensure a return of the inflation rate to within the target range. Year-on-year inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds (CPIX) increased at a year-on-year rate of 6,4 per cent in both May and June 2007, following an increase of 6,3 per cent in April. CPIX inflation has exceeded the upper end of the inflation target range of 6 per cent for the past three months. The main causes of the upward trend in inflation remain food and energy, but broader underlying pressures are also evident. If food and energy prices were excluded. CPIX inflation would have measured 4,6 per cent in May and 4,7 per cent in June, compared to 3,8 per cent in December 2006. This indicator has been rising consistently since the middle of 2006 when it measured 2,5 per cent. Food prices increased at year-on-year rates of 9,0 per cent and 9,4 per cent in May and June 2007 respectively, with grain product prices increasing by 13,4 per cent in June. Meat price inflation has been declining steadily since it peaked late last year, but nevertheless recorded an increase of 9,9 per cent in June. Petrol prices increased at year-on-year rates of 13,7 per cent in May and 11,1 per cent in June as a result of a cumulative increase of R0,57 per litre in these two months. Prices of services, which tend to adjust more slowly than those of goods, have also been displaying an upward trend, having increased at a year-on-year rate of 5,7 per cent in June, compared to 4,6 per cent in January 2007. The higher inflation trend is also observed in administered prices excluding petrol, which have increased at rates of around 5,5 per cent since October 2006. Price declines in clothing, footwear and furniture continue to moderate pressures on inflation. Production price inflation remains high, but declined to a year-on-year rate of 10,4 per cent in June, following rates in excess of 11 per cent in the previous two months. The prices of agricultural goods have been increasing at year-on-year rates of almost 20 per cent since March 2007, whereas manufactured goods prices increases moderated to 6,4 per cent in May and June. Imported goods inflation declined from 11,7 per cent in May 2007 to 9,4 per cent in June. The most recent central forecast of the Bank indicates a slight deterioration in the inflation outlook, particularly in the short term, when compared to the previous forecast. CPIX inflation is now expected to remain above the upper level of the inflation target range at an average of around 6,3 per cent before declining to within the inflation target range in the second quarter of 2008. Thereafter it is expected to follow a downward path, to reach around 5,1 per cent by the end of 2009. The higher trend results from a higher-than-expected second quarter outcome which raised the starting point of the forecast, and a revised assumption for international oil prices. The MPC identified a number of upside risks to the inflation outlook. These include oil and food prices, and high rates of household consumption expenditure. The assessment of most of the other variables was relatively unchanged, although there is some uncertainty about the potential impact of international financial market developments. Food prices remain a threat to the inflation outlook despite the declining trend in meat price increases. High rates of increase in the spot prices of maize and wheat during the first half of this year are expected to sustain the higher food inflation. Of further concern are the year-on-year increases in June in the prices of agricultural products and manufactured food at the producer price level measuring 18,7 per cent and 15,0 per cent respectively. These indicate possible further pressures on food prices at the retail level in coming months. North Sea Brent crude oil is currently trading at around US$72 per barrel, which is similar to prices prevailing at the time of the previous MPC meeting. During July however, the price rose to levels slightly below US$80 per barrel. More recently, prices have moderated partly as a result of concerns about the growth outlook in the United States and the sell-off in financial markets. The domestic petrol price declined in July and August by a total of R0,23, reflecting exchange rate and product price movements. Despite this recent respite, risks to inflation emanating from this source are still considered to be on the upside. There is little evidence of a sustained slowdown in household consumption expenditure growth. The FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index still remains near record levels despite a moderate decline in the second quarter of 2007. Retail sales growth remains robust, although the most recent data shows that the year-on-year increase in June declined to 6,4 per cent compared to rates of growth of 5,9 per cent and 9,2 per cent in April and May respectively. Retail sales of household furniture, appliances and equipment declined by 13,5 per cent in June compared to a year ago. Sales of private motor vehicles have also continued to decline. The seasonally adjusted number of new passenger vehicles sold in the three months to July 2007 reflected a decrease of 5,4 per cent compared to the previous three months. Growth in credit extension to the private sector remains high, and it is premature to assess the impact on credit extension of the introduction of the National Credit Act in June. Twelve-month growth in banks' loans and advances extended to the private sector increased at a rate of 27,9 per cent in June. Adjusted for securitisation transactions, the increase would have been 30,3 per cent. Growth in loans and advances to the corporate sector measured 36,2 per cent in June, compared to 33,3 per cent in May, while growth in credit extended to the household sector moderated from 22,8 per cent in May to 21,5 per cent in June. Year-on-year growth of asset-backed credit has been declining steadily over the past few months, recording a growth rate of 23,6 per cent in June. Wage settlements have been trending upwards. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average level of wage settlements measured 6,5 per cent in 2006. In the first half of 2007, wage settlement rates have averaged 6,8 per cent, but a growing number of recent settlements have been closer to 8 per cent. This may still be consistent with the inflation target if labour productivity growth is accounted for. Nevertheless the upward trend is of some concern given the importance of wage developments in the price formation process. As a result of the uncertainties in the international financial markets and the strengthening of the US dollar, the rand exchange rate has depreciated somewhat, particularly over the past few days. Before the onset of the current round of global financial market volatility, the rand had appreciated due to amongst others the weakness in the US dollar against other currencies, and anticipated capital inflows related to possible merger and acquisition activity. At one stage the rand had reached levels slightly below R6,80 at a time when the US dollar had reached an historic low against the euro. However the increased global risk aversion and a recovery in the US dollar reversed this trend and the rand is currently trading at a level of around R7,45 compared to R7,22 at the time of the previous meeting. Since the beginning of the year, the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand has declined by 6,2 per cent. Despite the global financial market developments noted above, non-resident interest in South African assets, in particular equities, has remained positive. Since 20 July, when emerging market spreads started to widen, non-residents have been net purchasers of equities totaling in excess of R11 billion, although in the past few days they have been moderate net sellers to the value of around R150 million. The sustainability of these inflows will depend in part on global liquidity conditions as well as domestic growth prospects. Conditions in the local foreign exchange market during July allowed for further accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. At the end of July gross gold and foreign exchange reserves had increased by US$1,06 billion to US$29,33 billion, while the international liquidity position had increased to US$26,97 billion. The domestic economy continues to grow at a brisk pace but there are some signs of moderation. GDP grew at an annualised rate of 4,7 per cent in the first quarter of 2007, down from 5,6 per cent in the final quarter of 2006. Mining production has continued to disappoint despite favourable commodity prices. In the second quarter of 2007, the physical volume of mining production remained under pressure, declining by 1,4 per cent compared to the previous quarter. The physical volume of manufacturing production also came under pressure in the second quarter when it grew by only 0,1 per cent. Nevertheless the index of utilisation of productive capacity in the manufacturing sector increased to 86,8 per cent in the second quarter. The RMB/BER Business Confidence Index declined marginally in the second quarter of 2007. A more positive outlook is provided by the Investec/BER Purchasing Managers Index which increased in July 2007 following three consecutive monthly declines. Despite some negative indications, growth is expected to be underpinned in the coming months by the continued acceleration in the growth of real gross fixed capital formation which increased at a year-on-year rate of almost 22 per cent in the first quarter of 2007 and brought the ratio of fixed capital formation to GDP to over 20 per cent. At this stage there is no evidence that the recent turbulence in the international financial markets will have marked effects on the domestic growth outlook, although this will depend to some extent on the impact of these developments on the US growth performance. To date the impact has been felt in the exchange rate, and to a greater extent on the capital market. Although the prices of equities on the JSE Limited declined from their recent elevated levels, at the end of trade on 15 August, the All-share Index was still over 8 per cent higher than that prevailing at the beginning of the year. This suggests that the possible impact on consumption via the wealth effect, and on investment are likely to be limited. The international environment has become increasingly volatile and uncertain. The updated IMF World Economic Outlook forecasts published in July this year show a 0,3 per cent increase in expected world GDP growth for both 2007 and 2008. World inflation is expected to remain more or less unchanged and average 3,5 per cent for 2007 and 2008. This forecast was made before the recent turmoil on the international financial markets and it is too early assess the risks that these developments may pose to the global growth and inflation outlook. Having considered recent developments, the MPC has decided that a further adjustment in the monetary policy stance is required in order to ensure that CPIX inflation returns to within the target range. Accordingly, the repo rate is adjusted by 50 basis points to 10,0 per cent per annum with effect from 17 August 2007. The MPC will continue to monitor the relevant economic and financial developments in order to ensure that its mandate is fulfilled."
Philippines,2007-08-22,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 6.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 8.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. In its decision to maintain policy settings, the Monetary Board considered the benign inflation outlook and noted that the balance of risks to future inflation has remained essentially unchanged. With the additional monetary measures in place, the growth of domestic liquidity moderated in May and June. Rainfall conditions have normalized in most of Luzon and the approved wage hike for NCR is not expected to generate additional inflationary pressures. At the same time, demand pressures—while on a broadly strengthening trend—continue to be limited. The relatively firm peso also serves to temper price pressures. Inflation expectations also remain subdued, suggesting that markets are confident about the BSP's anti-inflation resolve. Given the policy moves implemented in May and July, the Monetary Board decided to keep policy settings steady to give more time for the recent measures to work their way through the system. The Board discussed the recent turmoil in global financial markets and noted that this would have a limited impact on the domestic financial system. Going forward, the BSP will continue to closely monitor monetary and financial developments to ensure price stability and the sustained growth of the economy."
Malaysia,2007-08-24,"At its meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. During the first half of 2007, growth of the Malaysian economy has remained favourable with the slower external sector being balanced by stronger growth in domestic demand. In assessing the outlook for the rest of the year, the turbulence in the global financial markets over the recent weeks has created a higher degree of uncertainty regarding global economic growth. While the Malaysian economy is not insulated from the volatility in the global financial markets and possible consequential moderation in global demand, strong domestic fundamentals will provide a sound foundation for growth. While rising global food and commodity prices could potentially increase the risk of higher prices, the inflation rate in Malaysia is expected to remain low. Inflationary expectations are also well-contained. The future stance of monetary policy would be determined by Bank Negara Malaysia's assessment of new data and information and their implications on the medium-term prospects for price stability and economic growth. Bank Negara Malaysia 24 August 2007."
Hungary,2007-08-27,"At its meeting on 27 August 2007, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to maintain the central bank base rate at 7.75%. The Council also discussed the August 2007 issue of the Bank's Quarterly Report on Inflation. The Monetary Council continues to believe that the 3% medium-term target for inflation will be met in 2009. The rate of consumer price increases is likely to moderate more slowly in 2008 than expected earlier, due mainly to temporary factors outside the influence of monetary policy. In the August Report projection, inflation falls to below 3% in 2009, mainly reflecting transient effects. There has recently been a marked, though temporary, deterioration in the domestic economy's growth prospects; and the level of output may lag behind the longer-term trend over the forecast period. In the Council's judgement, the supply shock affecting output growth in agriculture will prove short-lived. However, the cyclical indicators suggest that the greater-than-expected decline in demand may also have played a role in the recorded slowdown in GDP growth in Q2. This larger fall in demand may pull down on inflation over the longer term. But in the short term consumer price developments are affected negatively by the supply shocks to the economy. Rises in agricultural prices and the price of oil are likely to put upward pressure on inflation in 2008; however, the expected reversal of rises in food prices may contribute to inflation falling below target in 2009. Consistent with its earlier practice, the Monetary Council does not wish to respond to  largely temporary  price fluctuations triggered by short-lived supply shocks. The inflationary effects of cost and supply shocks of the past year may only unwind simultaneously with a rapid adjustment of wage growth. There are signs that the rate of wage growth may have started to moderate in 2007 H1. The Monetary Council continues to monitor closely indirect inflationary effects induced by expectations and wage developments. In the Council's view, the greater-than-expected slowdown in economic growth and the strong disinflationary effect of the fall in demand continue to represent downside risks. The financial market turbulence stemming from the problems in the US sub-prime mortgage market has contributed significantly to uncertainty in the global investment environment, leading to a rise in the required risk premium on forint assets. However, the Council believes that the imbalances in the domestic economy have recently diminished considerably. This, in turn, has reduced Hungary's vulnerability to external shocks. In line with the prospects for inflation and the economy, the Monetary Council continues to believe there is room for further reductions in the central bank base rate in the future. However, a great degree of caution is needed in making monetary policy decisions, given the considerable uncertainty in the international environment."
Israel,2007-08-27,"27.8.07 The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for September 2007 by 25 basis points to 4 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for September 2007 will rise by 25 basis points to 4 percent. This is consistent with the policy of maintaining price stability, as expressed by the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose in July by 1.1 percent, above forecasts that had predicted, on average, a rise of 0.8 percent. In the last twelve months the CPI has risen by a modest 0.3 percent,but since the beginning of the year by 2.1 percent. According to the Bank of Israel's econometric models, in the past 12 months local prices--the price component that is not directly affected by changes in the shekel exchange rate--have risen at a rate in excess of the upper boundary of the target inflation range. Forecasts: Local forecasters expect, on average, that the inflation rate for 2007 will reach around 3 percent (the upper boundary of the target inflation range), and that inflation over the next 12 months will reachthe midpoint of the range, 2 percent. At the same time, they expect, on average, that the Bank of Israel will raise the interest rate, and that in a year's time it will stand at 4.5 percent. The expectation of inflation overthe next 12 months, as derived from the capital markets, stands at around 2 percent. The market also expects that the interest rate will rise over the next 12 months. The Bank of Israel's econometric models also imply that the interest rate needs to be raised if inflation is to be within the targetrange in the next 12 months and in 2008. Real economic activity: Recently published indicators point to the continued rapid growth of the economy. The composite state-of-the-economyindex rose in July by 1.1 percent, including a revision upward of earlier indices. National Accounts data published last week show that the economy grew at an annual rate of more than 6 percent, in annual terms, in the firsthalf of 2007, and that both imports and exports of goods grew rapidly. </td> Labor market and wages: The Labor Force Survey for the second quarter of 2007 shows a rise in employment, with a significant increase in therate of participation in the labor force, and a slight drop in the unemployment rate. Demand for workers in the business sector, according to the Employers Survey, shows a high level of demand. In the period March to May, there was a rise in average wage per employee post in all principal industries of the economy of 3.1 percent, compared to the corresponding period of last year. These developments took place against a background of a further slowdown in the increase in labor productivity, which is consistent with the closing of the output gap. Budgetary policy: The cumulative government budget surplus since the beginning of the year stands at NIS 6.8 billion, and the budget deficitfor 2007 is expected to be less than 1.5% of GDP. The proposed 2008 budget, which was approved by the government in August, and is consistent with the multi-year budgetary targets, together with a public sector wage agreement reached in July, contribute to the credibility of budgetary policy. Forex market: Since the previous interest rate decision (on July 22) up till August 24, the shekel strengthened by 1.5 percent against the dollar and by 3.2 percent against the euro, while most other currencies weakened significantly against the dollar. The strengthening of the shekel since the beginning of the month is consistent with the underlying forces supporting the value of the shekel, notably the surplus in the current account of the balance of payments, and foreign investment in the economy. Capital market: Events in the local capital market were affected by the credit crisis which occurred in the subprime mortgage market in the US and which expanded to other markets; since the previous interest rate decision (on July 22) up till August 23, the leading indices on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange fell by around 8 percent. At the same time, yields on local unindexed government bonds for all terms to maturity rose by about 0.6 percentage points on average. Yields on corporate bonds also rose. As a result of the sharp fall in bond yields in the US, the gap between yields on 10-year unindexed bonds in Israel and in the US reached 1.45 percentage points. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, rose to 0.33 percent, after remaining stable for some time at 0.17 percent. Despite the rise in volatility in the financial markets in Israel, there were no problems of liquidity in the markets, which continued to function well. Global background conditions: Developments in the capital marketsaround the world were influenced by the credit crisis which occurred in the subprime mortgage market in the US and which spread to other markets. As a result of the crisis, investors reviewed the risk inherent in their portfolios, which led to their closing positions. As a result, there was a rapiddrop in the price of those assets considered relatively risky and share prices fell. Since the previous interest rate decision (on July 22) up till August 23, indices of stock exchanges in the developed countries dropped by 6-12 percent, and in the developing markets by 9-15 percent. In the same period, the yield to maturity of bonds in developing countries rose while theyield to maturity of government bonds in developed countries such as the US. Germany and Japan, and with low risk, fell. The underlying conditions that the crisis created together with losses in the capital market are expected to impact on economic activity in the US and to a lesser extent in othercountries too. However, the effect of the crisis on global growth is expected to be relatively slight due to the diffusion of sources of growth in the world. The crisis in the credit markets makes it considerably more likelythat the US Federal Reserve will pursue an expansionary monetary policy, in contrast to expectations in recent months. In Europe, the tendency is still towards a tightening of monetary policy. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to raise the interest rate is intended to increase the probability of meeting the inflation target, in light of the acceleration in the actual inflation rate in recent months, and in expectations of inflation in the future.This rise in expected inflation is fed by, inter alia, the rapid growth in the Israeli economy, and with it, the further contraction in the output gap reflected, among other things, by the continued rise in local prices. The decision to raise the interest rate by a relatively modest 0.25 percentage points was influenced by factors likely to moderate the forces of inflation in thefuture, which stem from the continuation of underlying forces that supportthe value of the shekel--the continued surplus in the current account and the inflow of capital--and from the expectations of a reduction in the interest rate in the US, which will contribute to the contraction of the interest-rate gap between the shekel and the dollar. The Bank ofIsrael notes that despite the rise in uncertainty in the financial markets, the markets in Israel are functioning well and have suffered no problems of liquidity. This is in contrast to the case in several developed countries. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. 27.8.07 The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for September 2007 by 25 basis points to 4 percent.

Poland,2007-08-29,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 29 August 2007 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 28-29 August 2007 The Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point to the level: (cid:131) reference rate 4.75 % on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 6.25 % on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 3.25 % on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 5.00 % on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of strong growth encompassing all its sectors. The data released since the last meeting of the Council confirm previous assessments that strong economic activity should be sustained for at least next few quarters. The continuation of fast economic growth in Poland should be supported by the still strong activity in the world economy, including the euro area. Since the last meeting of the Council, however, there have been turbulences in the international financial markets and a rise in the risk of a stronger than earlier expected weakening in the economic activity in the United States and, consequently, also in the euro area. In July the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland amounted to 2.3%, and hence it was close to the NBP's inflation target of 2.5% for another consecutive month. The Council expects that in 2007 Q3 inflation may temporarily fall in relation to 2007 Q2. In the Council's assessment, in the coming quarters economic growth will most probably continue to exceed the growth of potential GDP. The latest information on labour market developments point to a continuation of a high wage growth and a deeper than previously estimated deterioration in the relation between wage and labour productivity growth. A further build-up in wage pressure and, consequently, inflationary pressure is possible. The recently made decisions leading to a decrease in revenues and an increase in expenditures of the public finance sector may lead to a deterioration of the public finance balance, which in the medium run may result in additional inflationary pressure. The mid-term increase in inflation may be curbed by the continuing very good financial results of enterprises and a high investment growth conducive to productivity growth. Increase in inflation in the medium term may also be constrained by low growth of external prices, related to the monetary policy pursued by major central banks as well as the globalisation and the ensuing rise in competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services. However, in the Council's assessment, the impact of those factors would be insufficient to keep inflation at the target level over the monetary policy transmission horizon. Therefore, the Council assessed the probability of inflation running above the inflation target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running below the target and decided to increase the NBP interest rates. ul.

Thailand,2007-08-29,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 29 August 2007 Ms. Suchada Kirakul. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. Recent economic data showed signs of positive adjustment in domestic demand, even though consumer and business confidence remained fragile. Exports slowed down, but overall economic growth forecasts stayed unchanged. Inflation was expected to remain low, due partly to private spending that had yet to fully recover, while the risk of higher oil prices moderated compared to the previous meeting. The MPC assessed that risks to growth and inflation were unchanged from the previous meeting, and therefore decided to keep the 1-day repurchase rate at 325 per cent per annum. However risks to the global economy and financial markets increased as a result of rising concerns in the US subprime market. Although the direct impact on the Thai economy thus far was minimal, the MPC viewed that the indirect effects from this problem would need to be monitored, going forward."
Euroarea,2007-09-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our previous meeting has confirmed that the medium-term outlook for price stability remains subject to upside risks, as identified by both our economic and monetary analyses. Incoming macroeconomic data also confirm the strong fundamentals of the euro area economy and support a favourable medium-term outlook for real GDP growth. Against this background, our monetary policy stance is still on the accommodative side with, inter alia, money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area. At the same time, the financial market volatility and reappraisal of risk of recent weeks have led to an increase in uncertainty. Given this high level of uncertainty, it is appropriate to gather additional information and to examine new data before drawing further conclusions for monetary policy in the context of our medium-term-oriented monetary policy strategy aimed at delivering price stability. Accordingly, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. On the basis of our assessment, and by acting in a firm and timely manner, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. This is all the more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. All in all, the data available suggest that economic activity in the euro area is continuing to expand at sustained rates. Euro area real GDP growth in the second quarter moderated to 0.3% quarter on quarter, compared with 0.7% in the previous quarter. However, due account should be taken of the volatility of these growth rates. Accordingly, economic growth during the first half of 2007, as a whole, was in line with potential growth. Data on activity in the third quarter  from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates  remain favourable overall and support the assessment that real GDP is growing at sustained rates. In particular, the latest data on unemployment are favourable and the levels of all confidence indicators to August were high. Global economic activity is expected to remain robust, as the likely slowdown in the United States is expected to be largely offset by the continued strong growth in emerging markets. This will continue to provide support to euro area exports and investment. In addition, consumption growth in the euro area should strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions improve further. That said, in view of the overall potential impact of increased financial market volatility and the re-pricing of risk on the real economy, appropriate monitoring of the economy's evolution is necessary. This outlook is also reflected in the September 2007 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which for the first time include Cyprus and Malta. The projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 2.2% and 2.8% in 2007, and between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2008. In comparison with the June Eurosystem staff projections, the range projected for real GDP growth in 2007 has been revised slightly downwards, mainly reflecting the assumptions of somewhat higher oil prices and slightly tighter market financing conditions due to higher average risk premia. In the view of the Governing Council, the ranges presented serve as a good reminder of the general uncertainty surrounding economic projections, which it is worthwhile emphasising given the current volatility in the financial markets. The risks to these projections for economic growth are judged to lie on the downside. These downside risks relate mainly to a potentially broader impact from the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets, global imbalances and protectionist pressures, as well as further oil and commodity price rises. With respect to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 1.8% in August 2007, the same rate as in the previous month. However, over the remainder of this year, inflation rates are likely to increase again to above 2%. In the September 2007 ECB staff projections, annual HICP inflation is projected to lie between 1.9% and 2.1% in 2007, and between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2008. In 2008, a declining impact from indirect taxes and energy prices is expected to be compensated by higher pressures from unit labour costs. Compared with the June 2007 Eurosystem staff projections, the new ranges for 2007 and 2008 are within the ranges previously projected. The Governing Council is of the view that risks to this outlook for price developments lie on the upside. These upside risks include increases in indirect taxes beyond those anticipated thus far and further increases in oil prices and prices for agricultural products. More fundamentally, stronger than expected wage developments and an increase in the pricing power in market segments with low competition may occur. It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities. The potential materialisation of these risks  or their abatement  requires close monitoring. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. On the basis of the latest available data (covering the period to the end of July), the underlying rate of monetary and credit expansion remains strong. This is reflected in the rapid growth of the broad monetary aggregate. M3, which grew at an annual rate of 11.7% in July, and the strength of MFI loans to the private sector, which continue to increase at double-digit rates on an annual basis. When identifying and assessing the policy-relevant underlying trends in monetary expansion, it is important to look through short-term volatility and the impact of temporary factors on developments in specific monetary aggregates. Taking the appropriate broader and medium-term-oriented perspective, there are several indications that increases in short-term interest rates over recent quarters have influenced monetary developments. For example, increases in short-term rates have contributed to a more modest expansion of M1, as the opportunity cost of holding the most liquid components of M3 has increased. Moreover, higher short-term rates have led to some stabilisation in the growth of MFI credit to the private sector, albeit at double-digit annual rates, with the growth of household borrowing moderating as house price dynamics and real estate activity have slowed. However, these developments are yet to dampen the overall rate of monetary expansion, as the flattening of the yield curve has increased the attractiveness of monetary assets relative to less liquid longer-maturity instruments, thereby causing broad money growth to rise. Furthermore, the growth of loans to non-financial companies has shown renewed vigour in recent months. In the current situation, let me remind you that volatility in financial markets can temporarily exert considerable influence over monetary dynamics. In previous episodes, private sector perceptions of and attitudes towards risk, and the resulting portfolio behaviour, have strongly affected monetary developments. The monetary data for July may already have been partly influenced by such portfolio considerations and this could possibly apply even more to the August data to be released later in September. However, as has been demonstrated in the past, an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the monetary data can help in our understanding of the impact of financial developments on monetary developments and to extract the policy-relevant signal in monetary growth with regard to longer-term inflationary trends. In such circumstances, the broad-based approach adopted in the ECB's monetary analysis is at a premium. Overall, the continued vigour of underlying monetary and credit expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring. To sum up, a cross-check of the information identified under the economic analysis with the outcome of the monetary analysis has confirmed the existence of upside risks to price stability over the medium term  against the background of the strong fundamentals of the euro area economy. Accordingly, our monetary policy stance is still on the accommodative side with, inter alia, money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area. At the same time, given the high level of uncertainty, additional information is needed before further conclusions for monetary policy can be drawn. Accordingly, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. On the basis of our assessment, and by acting in a firm and timely manner, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. In the current context, it is all the more important that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. In the area of fiscal policy, progress in structural fiscal consolidation remains slow and there are risks that some countries will pursue expansionary pro-cyclical fiscal policies. For the execution of 2007 budgets and the planning of 2008 budgets, it is crucial that the mistakes made during the previous economic upswing of 1999-2000 are not repeated. At present, countries with fiscal imbalances need to correct them in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. The commitment in the Eurogroup to reach medium-term budgetary objectives in 2008 or 2009, and by 2010 at the latest, has to be respected by all euro area member countries. Those countries that have already achieved sound fiscal positions need to abstain from pro-cyclical fiscal policies. Turning to structural reform, the Governing Council welcomes further efforts to increase the productive capacity of the euro area through higher employment. Euro area labour markets have shown clear signs of progress in the last few years, partly reflecting the impact of past labour market reforms. Further progress is needed, however, to enhance occupational and geographical labour mobility and skill creation, so as to overcome the comparatively low rates of labour market participation and still high unemployment rates in some countries and regions."
South Korea,2007-09-07,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. The domestic economy seems likely to maintain its upward trend. While exports continue to post robust growth, domestic demand is showing a steady increase, led by consumption. Consumer price inflation remains stable despite the rise in international oil prices. The upward trend of real estate prices has been blunted. In the financial markets, there is ample liquidity and financial institutions' lending continues to show a steady increase. Meanwhile, financial market price variables have shown increased volatility, affected by the recent international financial market unrest. The future level of the policy rate will continue to be decided after overall consideration of the movements of prices, economic activity and the financial markets, as shown by the latest indicators."
Chile,2007-09-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 September 2007 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.75% (annual). This decision is necessary for the rise in annual inflation of recent months to be truly transitory, and for projected inflation around two years ahead to stand at 3%. Although the external scenario relevant for the Chilean economy continues to be generally positive, downside risks have increased. In fact, the past few weeks have seen an intensification of problems in international financial markets. Meanwhile, the copper price remains high, the oil price has continued on an upward trend and the prices of several food products are still high. Domestically, beyond the performance of some specific sectors, the information available suggests that output is still dynamic. Imports growth indicates that domestic demand would continue expanding with relative strength in the third quarter. Salaried employment continues on the rise and internal financial conditions remain favorable. Annual CPI inflation has risen above 4%, affected by a deepening of unusual price increases in some foods, both perishable and non-perishable. The latter have also contributed to increase core CPIX1 inflation (that excludes fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities). Alternative measures of trend inflation stand above 3% and the growth rate of labor costs has increased. Inflation expectations reveal an outlook comparable to that in the last Monetary Policy Report, with high levels for the short term, and near 3% further ahead. The Board believes opportune to point out that the future path of the monetary policy interest rate will depend on incoming information and its implications on projected inflation. Particularly important will be the unfolding of the international scenario, the possible propagation of recent inflationary shocks to other prices and the evolution of output gaps. * The Spanish original prevails."
Turkiye,2007-09-13,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate from 17.50 to 17.25 percent, and lending rate from 22.50 to 22.25 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. from 13.50 to 13,25 percent, lending rate from 25.50 to 22,25 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions from 21.50 to 21,25 percent. Readings on economic activity and inflation are in line with the outlook presented in the July Inflation Report. While private consumption and investment demand exhibits signs of recovery, external demand moderates. Aggregate demand conditions continue to support the disinflation process. The Committee assesses that developments in services inflation have been more favorable than expected. Notwithstanding the risks related to energy and food prices, inflation is expected to further decelerate owing to the lagged effects of strong monetary tightening. The Committee closely monitors the developments in international liquidity conditions and credit markets. In the meeting, the Committee evaluated the recent data, and assessed that global developments are likely to restrain both the domestic and external demand growth, increasing the downward risks on achieving the 4 percent target in the medium term. In this respect, the Committee decided that current conditions require launching the measured rate cuts mentioned in the Inflation Report. The Committee underlines that the current monetary policy stance continues to be restrictive. The exact timing and extent of further easing may vary depending on the incoming information regarding global liquidity conditions, external demand, public expenditures and other determinants of medium term inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook will lead the Committee to reconsider its stance.

Peru,2007-09-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2007 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 4.75% TO 5.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) approved to raise the monetary reference rate from 4.75 to 5.0 percent. This preventive measure is taken considering the lags with which monetary policy operates in order to continue maintaining expectations of low inflation anchored, in view of the robust growth shown by domestic demand in a context market by an increase in the price of imported inputs. The Board will continue to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, differentiating the factors that have temporary impacts from those with permanent effects. The Board analyzed the following macroeconomic information: The Consumer Price Index for Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.14 percent in August and accumulated 2.2 percent over the last 12 months, within the monetary target range (2 percent, plus or minus one percentage point). Core inflation indicator of the inflation trend was 0.3 percent and accumulated 2.0 percent over the last twelve months. As reflected in the surveys carried out with economic analysts and financial entities at the end of August, the inflation rate this year is expected to be 2.5 percent. Moreover, economic analysts consider that inflation next year would reach 2.0 percent, while financial entities consider that it would reach 2.3 percent. On the other hand, non-financial entities expect inflation to remain at 1.8 percent at the close of 2007 and 2008. Economic activity continues to show a robust growth: GDP grew 7.8 percent in the first half of the year and domestic demand grew 10.4 percent during the same period. The average exchange rate in August was 3.159 per dollar, which represented a 0.08 percent average appreciation of the nuevo sol against the dollar compared with the month of July. In terms of the currency basket of our trading partners, the nuevo sol appreciated 0.72 percent mainly due to the strengthening of the dollar against other currencies. The average monthly interest rate in the interbank market was 4.77 percent in August, a level close to the reference interest rate. The average spread of the global bond (indicator of the country risk) increased from 129 bps. in July to 169 bps. in August, in a context of volatility in the international financial markets. Moreover, the yield on the 20-year sovereign bond in soles closed at 6.75 percent in August, a level 10 bps. higher than at the close of July (6.65 percent), while the yield on the 30-year bond at the close of the month was 6.90 percent, a level slightly higher (7 bps.) than at the close of the previous month. Furthermore, the average corporate prime rate rose from 5.3 to 5.4 percent between July and August. During the session, the Board approved the annual interest rates on the following active and passive operations in soles between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.75 percent. Overnight deposits: 4.25 percent. Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the interest rates on the following operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage point. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.75 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 3.5 percent. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (October 2007) in the session to be held on October 4, 2007. Furthermore, the following Inflation Report will be published on October 2."
United States,2007-09-18,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 4-3/4 percent. Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year, but the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally. Today's action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year. However, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Developments in financial markets since the Committee's last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Charles L Evans; Thomas M Hoenig; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Frederic S Mishkin; William Poole; Eric Rosengren; and Kevin M Warsh. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 5-1/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston. New York. Cleveland. St. Louis. Minneapolis. Kansas City, and San Francisco."
Egypt,2007-09-20,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release September 20, 2007 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 875 percent per annu. In its meeting held on September 20, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and overnight lending rates at 875 percent and 1075 percent, respectivel. The annual headline CPI inflation inched-up to 845 percent (y/y) in August compared to 8 percent in Jul. This was driven by the rise in domestic food prices on the back of accelerating international prices, particularly wheat, maize, and edible oi. However annual headline CPI inflation declined by around four percentage points since it peaked at 128 percent in March 200. The MPC decision was a result of differing inflationary signal. While headline CPI has been on a declining trend since March, inflationary demand pressures continue to be a concer. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation and the recent developments in international financial markets, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Israel,2007-09-24,"24.9.07 The Bank of Israel interest rate for October 2007 remains unchanged at 4 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for October 2007 will remain unchanged at 4 percent. This is consistent with the policy of maintaining price stability, as expressed by the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose in August by 0.7 percent, in line with the forecasts. In the last twelve months the CPI has risen by 1 percent, and since the beginning of the year by 2.8 percent.In the third quarter of 2007 domestic prices, i.e., prices not directly affected by changes in the shekel exchange rate, as derived from the Bank of Israel's econometric models, continued rising at a rate above the upper bound of the inflation target range, and the import component of prices also rose, due to the depreciation of the shekel against the dollar that started in the second quarter. Inflation forecasts: Israeli forecasters expect, on average, thatthe inflation rate for 2007 will reach 2.6 percent, and that inflation over the next 12 months will be 1.6 percent. At the same time they expect, on average, that the Bank of Israel's interest rate in a year's time will be 4.5 percent. The expectation of inflation over the next 12 months derived from rates of return in the capital market is around 1.2 percent, and, based on financial markets data, the interest rate is expected to rise by 0.5 percentage points in that period. The Bank of Israel's econometric models indicate that assuming an interest rate of 4 percent and the exchange rate at its current level, inflation twelve months from now will be close tothe middle of the target range. Real economic activity: The high rate of economic growth continues. According to the National Accounts estimates of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). GDP is expected to rise by 5.1 percent in 2007. The composite state-of-the-economy index rose in August by 0.7 percent, indicating continued growth Labor market and wages: The rate of employment rose by 0.5 percentage points from the first quarter of the year to the second, and reached 52.3 percent; unemployment fell to 7.6 percent, and according to the CBS estimates is expected to reach 7.4 percent at the end of 2007. The real wage per employee post was 4.4 percent higher in 2007:Q 2 than in 2006:Q 2. At the same time, as labor productivity flattened out and labor costs rose in 2007:Q 2, unit labor costs were 3 percent higher than in the first quarter. Budget policy: The cumulative government budget surplus since thebeginning of the year stands at NIS 7.6 billion. The budget performance sofar this year is consistent with a deficit of less than 1 percent of GDP in 2007. Forex market: Since the previous interest rate decision on August 28 up till September 23, the shekel strengthened by 2.3 percent against the dollar and by 0.2 percent against the euro. The underlying forces acting to strengthen the shekel of the shekel--notably the surplusin the current account of the balance of payments and foreign investment in the economy--continue to apply. In addition, the real exchange rate of the shekel against the basket of currencies weighted in accordance with Israel's foreign trade is presently at about its level at the beginning of the year. Capital market: Since the previous interest rate decision the index of prices of the leading shares on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange rose by 2.3 percent. At the same time the yield on 10-year Shahar bonds dropped by 0.28 percentage points. The gap between yields on 10-year bonds in Israel and on 10-year US government bonds contracted to one percentage point, down from 1.45 percentage points in the previous month, but remained significantly higher than in April-May. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread declined from 0.33 percent at the time ofthe previous discussion to 0.27 percent. Global background conditions: The crisis in the financial marketscontinued and spread from the US subprime mortgage market to other financial markets in the US and Europe. At the same time the degree of uncertaintyover global growth increased, as did expectations of a slowdown in the US and European economies. Increases in food and oil and other commodity prices point to the risk of higher inflation around the world. As a result of the financial market turbulence and its implications, the Federal Open MarketCommittee cut the interest rate by 0.5 percentage points, and the ECB leftits interest rate unchanged. Investment houses expect the high global growth rate, combined with the policy of central banks throughout the word, to help overcome the crisis. The main considerations behind the decision Based on assessments derived from the capital market, from private forecasters, and from the Bank of Israel's econometric models, the decision not to change the interest rate is consistent with the achievement of the inflation target over the coming twelve months. It appears that the effect on prices of the weakness of the dollar against the shekel is, at present, offsetting the inflationary pressures expressed by the risein domestic and other prices, such as those of electricity, oil, food, etc., and supports the assumption that the rate of inflation is likely to be within the price-stability target. This, against the background of the worldwide weakness of the dollar, the surplus in Israel's balance of payments, the continued flow into Israel of investments by nonresidents, and the contraction of the interest rate differential between the NIS and the dollar resulting from the 50 basis point cut in the US interest rate. If the expectation of some slowdown in growth in the US in the last quarter of 2007 and the first half of 2008 is confirmed, it would tend to reduce demand and prices in the Israeli economy, which would contribute to keeping inflation within the target range. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. 24.9.07 The Bank of Israel interest rate for October 2007 remains unchanged at 4 percent. The Bank of Israel interest rate for October 2007 remains unchanged at 4 percent. The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for October 2007 will remain unchanged at 4 percent.

Poland,2007-09-26,"Warsaw, 26 September 2007 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 25-26 September 2007 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 4.75% on an annual basis; lombard rate 6.25% on an annual basis; deposit rate 3.25% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 5.00% on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of strong growth encompassing all its sectors. The data released since the last meeting of the Council confirm previous assessments that strong economic activity should be sustained for at least next few quarters. The continuation of fast economic growth in Poland should be supported by the still strong activity in the world economy. Since August, however, there have been turbulences in the global financial markets. At the moment, though, it is difficult to assess the impact of these turbulences on growth of the American and euro area economies, and, consequently, on the Polish economy. In August the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland amounted to 1.5%. The decline in inflation observed in 2007 Q3, although deeper than previously expected, is of temporary nature. The Council assesses that in 2007 Q4 inflation will be close to the inflation target of 2.5%. In the Council's assessment, in the coming quarters economic growth will most probably continue to exceed the growth of potential GDP. The latest information on labour market developments point to a continuation of a high wage growth and a deeper than previously estimated deterioration in the relation between wage and labour productivity growth. A further build-up in wage pressure and, consequently, inflationary pressure is possible. The recently made decisions leading to a decrease in revenues and an increase in expenditures of the public finance sector may lead to a deterioration of the public finance balance, which in the medium run may result in additional inflationary pressure. The mid-term increase in inflation may be curbed by the continuing very good financial results of enterprises and high investment growth conducive to productivity growth. The increase in inflation may also be constrained by low growth of external prices related to the monetary policy pursued by major central banks as well as globalisation and the ensuing rise in competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services. The inflationary pressure may also be reduced by a possible slowdown of the global economy. In the Council's assessment, in the medium term the probability of inflation running above the inflation target decreased to a certain degree due to the previously implemented monetary policy tightening, though it is still higher than the probability of inflation running below the target. A more comprehensive assessment of the scale of the risk of inflation overshooting the inflation target will only be possible after analysing the data released in the future. The Council will be closely monitoring the growth and structure of domestic demand, including the degree of the expansionary fiscal policy stance, developments of the current account balance, the relation between wage and labour productivity growth, zloty exchange rate, the impact of globalisation on the economy and developments in international financial markets. The Council has adopted a resolution on the Monetary Policy Guidelines for the Year 2008, and approved the Forecast of the Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland for the Year 2008 together with the International Investment Position of Poland in 2006."
Romania,2007-09-26,"In its meeting of September 26, 2007, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR will vigilantly monitor developments in macroeconomic indicators and their outlook, both domestically and internationally, standing ready to adjust its instrument settings in order to achieve medium-term disinflation objectives in a sustainable manner and consolidate the convergence process with the European Union. The analysis of recent trends in macroeconomic indicators reveals a slowdown of the disinflation process and of the economic growth mainly due to supply-side factors (the impact of a prolonged drought on the farming sector) but also attributable to persistent domestic demand pressures. These pressures are also highlighted by the widening external imbalance. Year-on-year inflation climbed to 4.96 percent in August, close to the upper limit of this year's target band, due to a significant increase of food prices and a correction of the leu's exchange rate against the background of recent turbulences on the world financial markets. Wage dynamics stayed above productivity growth, emphasizing the risks of deteriorating external competitiveness and of labour cost-related inflationary pressures. In the monetary area, a revival of non-government credit dynamics is notable mainly due to the faster pace of foreign currency lending growth (foreign currency-denominated loans accounted for 50.6 percent of end-August overall non-government credit). In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 7.0 percent per annum and to pursue a firm control of liquidity via open-market operations, seeking to enhance the signalling role of the monetary policy rate and reduce the volatility of interbank money market rates. The NBR Board has also decided to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The short-term inflation outlook has worsened due to a prolonged impact of drought on food prices and uncertainties related to the evolution of leu's exchange rate given the difficulty of assessing the duration and the effects of the recent world financial markets turbulences. The NBR Board believes that achieving a sustainable disinflation and anchoring medium-term expectations require the maintenance of a cautious monetary policy stance as well as a strong support from the wage and fiscal components of the macroeconomic policy mix. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for."
Nigeria,2007-10-03,"PRESS RELEASE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 52 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. OCTOBER 3, 2007 The Monetary Policy Committee of the CBN met on 3rd October 2007 and decided to raise the MPR to 90 per cent 1) The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 3rd October, 2007. The Committee reviewed the major macroeconomic developments and the implementation of fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies in the third quarter of 2007, as well as the challenges for the rest of the year. The meeting, the fourth in 2007, lasted about 6 hours. The MPC noted both the global and domestic economic and financial developments. It also noted that the macroeconomic environment in the third quarter of the year has helped to sustain single-digit inflation, relatively stable naira/dollar exchange rate, and the inter-bank interest rate which remained within the corridor defined by the Bank's Monetary Policy Rate (MPR). 2) It however, noted the prospects for further increase in liquidity and the potential of further appreciation of the naira exchange rate, and of inflation in view of the possible substantial fiscal injections in the fourth quarter of the year arising from the supplementary budget at the federal and state levels. The Committee, thus, restated its commitment to ensuring continued price and exchange rate stability through appropriate monetary policy stance in the rest of the year. Key Macroeconomic Developments 3) Inflation: Inflation stayed within single-digit in the third quarter of 2007. The Committee noted with satisfaction the decline in year-on-year (headline) inflation from 64 per cent in June 2007 to 48 per cent in July, 2007 and further down to 42 per cent in August, 2007. 4) Exchange Rate: The MPC noted the slight appreciation in the naira exchange rate at the wDAS in July through September, 2007. The naira exchange rate at the wDAS appreciated from N12605/US$1 in June to N12475/US$1 in September 2007, representing an appreciation of about 103 per cent. The Committee noted the effect of rising private foreign exchange inflows on the naira exchange rate. 5) External Reserves: The Committee noted with satisfaction the increase in gross official reserves which stood at about US$47 billion in September, 2007. This represented an increase of 284 per cent when compared with the level of US$3663 billion in the corresponding period of 2006. The level of reserves, the Committee noted, could support approximately 20 months of current foreign exchange disbursements. 6) Growth in Monetary Aggregates: At the end of July, 2007, broad money grew by 133 per cent and further to 157 per cent in August. Staff projections 2 suggest that M2 grew by 161 per cent in September and would grow at about 176 per cent in October, 2007. When annualized these translate to 235 per cent in August; 215 per cent in September; and 211 per cent in October, 2007, respectively. 7) Reserve Money: In June, 2007 reserve money stood at N8584 billion which was lower than the target under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) programme target of N86000 billion. However as at end-September 2007 reserve money was N9286 billion compared with the target of N8800 for the third quarter of 2007. 8) Credit: Growth in aggregate domestic credit (net) declined by 366 per cent in August compared to 5611 per cent decline at the end of the second quarter of 2007, driven mainly by sustained decline in credit (net) to government. Meanwhile credit to the private sector maintained an upward trend, rising by about 4879 per cent by July 2007, compared to the target growth of 30 per cent for the year. 9) Interest Rates Developments: The MPC noted that volatility in the inter- bank rates continued to ameliorate as rates fluctuated around the MPR. The average inter-bank call rate moved between 60 per cent and 857 per cent since end-August, 2007. Other market rates remained relatively stable and were generally within the corridor. OUTLOOK FOR REST OF 2007 AND MPC DECISIONS The MPC noted that year-on-year headline inflation would continue to remain single-digit in the rest of 2007, but at the upper region of the single digit range. Overall a combination of stable food prices and a restrictive monetary policy stance is expected to help sustain the headline inflation within single- digit. The Committee also noted the challenges arising from rising autonomous private inflows and the attendant risk of further appreciation of the naira/dollar exchange rate. In addition, the Committee also noted the high possibility of substantial fiscal injections in the fourth quarter, arising from the supplementary budget at the federal and state levels. The Committee, thus, decided that the CBN: a) will continue to deploy increased forex sales for purposes of liquidity management b) embark upon active open market operations c) move the MPR to 90 per cent; which would be the repo rate and the rate at which CBN lends to the banks. d) The deposit money banks' deposits with the CBN will no longer earn interest. These measures are intended, amongst others, to deepen inter-bank trading and encourage banks to free-up resources to enlarge the credit market. Thank you for your kind attention. Prof Chukwuma C Soludo CFR Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria. Abuja."
Philippines,2007-10-03,"The Monetary Board decided today to reduce by 25 basis points the BSP's key policy interest rates to 5.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 7.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate, effective Friday, 5 October 2007. This is the second time that the policy rates were adjusted this year; the first time was in July when the tiering scheme was also removed. In deciding to cut policy rates, the Monetary Board considered the benign inflation outlook. Inflation is likely to fall well below the 4.0-5.0 percent target range in 2007 and within the 4.0 percent + 1 percentage point target in 2008. Liquidity growth decelerated for the fourth consecutive month in August; weather conditions have broadly normalized, supporting favorable supply of agricultural products; and recent wage adjustments are not expected to generate additional inflationary pressures. The Monetary Board noted that, while risks to the inflation outlook remain, these have on balance moderated. The continued strength of the peso provides a buffer against rising global commodity prices, including food and oil, while the impact of strong foreign exchange inflows on domestic liquidity has been mitigated by recent policy measures. The Monetary Board will continue to monitor developments in the global economy. The Board will also remain watchful of any emerging risk to future inflation to ensure stable prices, which is a precondition to robust and durable economic growth."
Euroarea,2007-10-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference here in Vienna. I would like to thank Governor Liebscher for his kind hospitality and to express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Let me now report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our previous meeting has confirmed that the outlook for price stability over the medium term is subject to upside risks. Against this background, and with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area, our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our primary objective. The fundamentals of the euro area economy support a favourable medium-term outlook for economic activity. In particular, corporate earnings and profitability have been sustained, employment growth has been robust and unemployment has fallen. However, given the financial market volatility and the reappraisal of risk seen in recent weeks, this assessment is surrounded by heightened uncertainty. In view of the only limited range of new economic data that have become available since our meeting in early September, particular caution needs to be exercised when assessing any potential impact of the financial market developments on the real economy. Hence, it remains necessary to gather additional information and examine new data before drawing further conclusions for monetary policy in the context of our medium-term-oriented monetary policy strategy focused on maintaining price stability. Accordingly, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. On the basis of our assessment, and by acting in a firm and timely manner, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability, thereby favouring an environment conducive to sustained economic growth, well-functioning markets and job creation. Providing such an anchor for medium and long-term inflation expectations is all the more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. On the basis of the available data, it appears that the sustained real economic growth experienced in the euro area in the first half of 2007 has continued through the summer. This is also reflected in available forecasts for real GDP growth for the third and fourth quarters of 2007. While financial market volatility appears to have contributed to a decline in euro area consumer and business confidence indicators in September, these indicators remain above their historical averages and continue to point to ongoing sustained growth during the second half of 2007. Looking further ahead, available forecasts for 2008 continue to confirm our main scenario of real GDP growing at around trend potential. This scenario is based on the expectation that global economic activity will remain robust, with the moderation of economic growth in the United States largely offset by the continued strength of emerging market economies. This will provide ongoing support to euro area exports and investment. Consumption growth in the euro area should also contribute to economic growth, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions remain supportive. That said, in view of the potential impact of increased financial market volatility and the re-pricing of risk on the real economy, the uncertainties surrounding this broadly favourable outlook for economic activity have increased. On balance, risks to the outlook for growth are judged to lie on the downside. These downside risks relate mainly to the potential for a broader impact from the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on confidence and financing conditions, concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances, as well as further oil and commodity price rises. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, the annual HICP inflation rate increased strongly to 2.1% in September 2007, from 1.7% in August. As we have already indicated on previous occasions, we are now entering a period during which unfavourable effects from energy prices will have a strong impact on annual HICP inflation rates. Owing mainly to such effects, as a result of the marked decline in energy prices a year ago combined with the recent substantial increase in oil prices, we expect the inflation rate to remain significantly above 2% in the remaining months of 2007 and in early 2008, before moderating again. Largely as a consequence of capacity constraints and relatively tight labour market conditions, inflation is expected to be around 2% on average in 2008. Risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside. They continue to include the possibility of further increases in the prices of oil and agricultural products as well as additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far. Taking into account the existence of capacity constraints, the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive signs from labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage developments may occur, and an increase in the pricing power in market segments with low competition could materialise. It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. A broad assessment of the monetary data supports the view that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. However, the August annual growth rate of close to 12% in the monetary aggregate M3 as well as the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations, which reached a record level of more than 14% in August, may have been influenced by a number of temporary or special factors, such as the flattening of the yield curve and the recent financial market volatility, and may therefore overstate the underlying rate of money and credit expansion. A broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important during the current period of financial market volatility, as the latter may influence the short-term behaviour of private agents and thereby affect monetary developments. Thus, monetary and credit data can offer an important insight into how financial institutions, households and firms have responded to the financial market volatility. Indeed, previous episodes of heightened financial market uncertainty have been associated with large portfolio shifts into safe and liquid monetary assets. For the time being, however, there is still little evidence in the monetary data for such shifts since the rise in financial market volatility in early August, while it cannot be excluded that the flow of bank loans to the non-financial corporate sector in August partly reflects the re-intermediation of some financing onto bank balance sheets. Further data will be required to develop a more complete view of the impact of the financial market volatility on bank balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. Overall, the continued vigour of underlying monetary and credit expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring so as to detect underlying trends on the one hand and to better understand shorter-term dynamics on the other. This will provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets. To sum up, a cross-check of the information identified under the economic analysis with the outcome of the monetary analysis has confirmed the existence of upside risks to price stability over the medium term, against the background of good economic fundamentals in the euro area. Accordingly, and with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area, our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our primary objective. At the same time, given the heightened level of uncertainty, additional information is needed before further conclusions for monetary policy can be drawn. Consequently, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. On the basis of our assessment, and by acting in a firm and timely manner, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability, which is all the more important in the current context. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. Turning to fiscal policy, the Governing Council is increasingly concerned about a weakening in structural fiscal consolidation efforts and the delaying of decisive action to address fiscal imbalances. Against this background, all euro area countries concerned are urged to meet the commitments made in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact to structurally improve their fiscal balances. The commitment made in the Eurogroup to reach medium-term budgetary objectives in 2008 or 2009, and by 2010 at the latest, must also be respected by all euro area countries. Those countries that have already achieved sound fiscal positions need to abstain from pro-cyclical fiscal policies. Sound fiscal policies will also make an important contribution to maintaining confidence at a time of heightened uncertainty in financial markets. With regard to structural reforms, the Governing Council fully supports efforts to enhance competition, increase productivity and foster market flexibility. While the services sector is a particularly important area for reform, further efforts are also needed to improve the functioning of the agricultural markets. Against the background of a marked increase in international food commodity prices, further liberalisation and reforms in the EU agricultural markets would help to enhance their efficiency and benefit European consumers through lower prices. The successful conclusion of the Doha round of world trade negotiations should also help to improve the functioning of global trade in general and of agricultural markets in Europe and worldwide in particular."
Thailand,2007-10-10,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 10 October 2007 Ms. Suchada Kirakul. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. Recent economic data showed signs of improvement in domestic demand, both consumption and investment. Exports continued to expand well despite lower growth in the latter half of the year. The direct impact of the problems in the US subprime market on the Thai economy had so far been limited. Nonetheless these problems were likely to be protracted and should be monitored closely. Inflation remained low. Going forward, there were increased risks of upward price pressure compared to the previous meeting due to higher oil prices and the likelihood of price increases for certain essential goods and services. The MPC assessed that the growth outlook was comparable to the previous meeting while risks to inflation increased slightly. However core inflation was expected to remain within the target range for the next 8 quarters. The MPC therefore decided to keep the 1-day repurchase rate at 325 per cent per annum."
Chile,2007-10-11,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 11 October 2007 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5.75% (annual). In the last few weeks the liquidity problems in international financial markets have moderated, while the US dollar has depreciated against the majority of global currencies. Meanwhile, a lower dynamism of the industrial economies is foreseen. On another front, the price of copper has increased again, and that of oil and various food products remain high, all above what was forecast. The preceding configures a relevant external scenario for the Chilean economy which continues to be positive, although the risk of adverse international scenarios persists. Domestically, the available information suggests that output in the third quarter was lower than projected in the last Monetary Policy Report, situation that appears to go beyond the performance of a few specific sectors and whose persistence is still uncertain. Regarding domestic demand, indicators suggest that the dynamism of investment has remained and that of consumption has dropped slightly. Salaried employment keeps rising and domestic financial conditions remain favorable. Annual CPI inflation has risen over 5% and is foreseen over the coming months to surpass the projections of the last Monetary Policy Report. The unusual increases in some food prices, both perishable and non-perishable, have not only persisted, but have intensified. Non-perishables have also contributed to increasing core CPIX1 inflation (that excludes fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities). Alternative measures of trend inflation stand above 3% annual. Notwithstanding the above, wages have not had an additional acceleration most recently, while the peso dollar parity has dropped over the last several weeks. Inflation expectations for the medium and long term remain anchored around 3% annual, coherent with a transitory increase in inflation. The future path of the monetary policy interest rate will depend on incoming information and its implications on projected inflation. Of particular importance will be the developments in the international scenario, the propagation of recent inflationary shocks to other prices, especially the path of wages and medium term inflation expectations, as well as the evolution of the output gap."
South Korea,2007-10-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. The domestic economy seems likely to maintain its upward trend. Exports continue to post robust growth and private consumption shows a steady increase, whereas the expansion of facilities investment has slowed down. Consumer price inflation remains stable despite the rise in international oil prices. The upward trend of real estate prices has flattened out. In the financial markets, there is ample liquidity and financial institutions' lending continues to show a steady increase. Meanwhile, the volatility of financial market price variables has decreased as international financial market unrest shows some signs of easing."
South Africa,2007-10-11,"Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the turbulence in the international financial markets has subsided somewhat. South Africa's financial markets have emerged from this episode relatively unscathed. The rand exchange rate has returned to levels that prevailed before the recent turbulence in the financial markets, and the All-share index on the JSE Limited has recovered and has reached new highs. Inflation has remained above the upper limit of the inflation target range and inflation expectations have risen somewhat in the wake of the higher inflation trend. Risks to the inflation outlook persist although there are some signs that the economy is responding to the tighter monetary policy stance. Inflation reacts with a lag to monetary policy changes, and the challenge for the MPC was to assess whether the observed response will be sustained and sufficient to bring inflation back to within the target range. CPIX inflation measured 6,4 per cent in both May and June of 2007 and then increased to 6,5 per cent in July before moderating to 6,3 per cent in August. Broader underlying pressures remain evident, and if food and energy were excluded. CPIX inflation would have measured 5,0 per cent in July and August. Food prices increased at year-on-year rates of 10,2 per cent and 11,3 per cent in July and August respectively, despite some moderation in meat price increases. Services price inflation continued its steady upward movement, measuring 5,8 per cent in August, compared to 4,6 per cent in January 2007. Administered prices excluding petrol increased by 6,8 per cent and 7,4 per cent in July and August respectively, having been steady around the 5,5 per cent level for the first half of the year. Petrol price reductions in both July and August resulted in a 6,0 per cent year-on-year increase in petrol prices in July, and a 0,5 per cent decline in August, which, along with further declines in the prices of clothing, footwear and furniture, contributed to the slight moderation seen in the August inflation rate. Production price inflation has declined steadily after peaking at 11,3 per cent in May 2007. In August it measured 9,5 per cent, with imported goods inflation and domestic goods inflation measuring 9,7 per cent and 9,3 per cent respectively. Both agricultural and manufactured food prices have continued to accelerate, indicating further food price pressures at the retail level in the near term. Agricultural food prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 22,9 per cent in August, while manufactured food prices increased by 14,9 per cent. The most recent central forecast of the Bank indicates a modest deterioration in the inflation outlook, particularly in the short term, when compared to the forecast considered at the previous MPC meeting. CPIX inflation is now expected to remain above the upper level of the inflation target range and to peak in the first quarter of 2008 at an average of 6,8 per cent before declining to the upper end of the inflation target range in the following quarter. Thereafter CPIX is expected to continue its downward path, and reach around 5,2 per cent by the end of 2009. The higher trend results from a higher-than-expected second quarter inflation outcome and revised administered price assumptions. Inflation expectations increased in the third quarter of 2007. According to the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at the University of Stellenbosch. CPIX inflation is expected to average 5,9 per cent in 2007 and 5,8 per cent and 5,6 per cent in the next two years. These expectations are 0,5 percentage points higher for 2007 and 2008 than those measured in the second quarter, and 0,4 percentage points higher for 2009. Although expectations are generally still within the inflation target range, the upward trend of expectations is of concern given the significant role that these expectations play in wage and price-setting decisions. Despite the upward drift in expectations, the view is still that inflation will decline over time. This is confirmed in part by the inverted yield curve and also by the medium-term inflation expectations indicated in the break-even inflation rates, as measured by the yield differential between conventional bonds and inflation-linked bonds of similar maturity. This measure has recently declined to just below 5,2 per cent, compared to 5,8 per cent in July. The higher inflation expectations are also reflected in wage trends. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average level of wage settlements for the nine months ending 30 September 2007 was 7,2 per cent compared to 6,4 per cent at the end of September 2006. Unit labour cost increases, which adjust for labour productivity changes, measured 5,5 per cent in the second quarter which is consistent with the inflation target range. The MPC identified a number of risks to the inflation outlook and is of the view that these risks remain on the upside. Exogenous factors, namely oil and food prices, continue to cloud the inflation outlook. International oil prices have increased since the previous MPC meeting when North Sea Brent crude oil was trading at around US$72 per barrel. After declining to US$68 per barrel in August, the upward trend was resumed and the price reached levels in excess of US$80 per barrel in September. At present the price is around US$78 per barrel. The appreciation of the rand against the dollar in September moderated the impact of the international price on the domestic petrol price. In October, the domestic price of 95 octane petrol increased by 10 cents per litre, following a reduction by the same amount the previous month. While a possible moderation of global growth could take some pressure off the oil prices, at this stage the risks to inflation emanating from this source are still considered to be on the upside. Food price developments also remain a risk. Domestic food prices have been influenced by adverse domestic supply conditions and by international developments, including the impact of biofuel demand. Over the past two years maize and wheat prices have increased significantly. The longer-term outlook for food prices as reflected in lower futures prices appears more promising. However, as indicated earlier, prices are expected to remain elevated as a result of pressure from production prices. One of the key inflation risks identified in previous meetings has been the strong growth of household consumption expenditure. More recently there has been evidence of some moderation. After increasing at an annualised rate of 7,4 per cent in the first quarter of 2007, household consumption expenditure increased at a rate of 5,5 per cent in the second quarter. This was the lowest quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2003. The main contributor to this slowdown was an annualised 10 per cent decline in durable goods expenditure. Retail sales have lost some momentum in recent months, having increased by 0,3 per cent in the three months to July compared to the previous 3 months. On a year-on-year basis, retail sales increased by 4,9 per cent in real terms in July 2007 compared to 7,1 per cent in June. The subdued trend in motor vehicle sales also continued, particularly with respect to passenger car sales. New commercial vehicle sales have also declined recently. The FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index, which reached an historically high level in the first quarter of 2007, declined in the second and third quarters. The moderation observed in the growth of household consumption expenditure is not reflected to the same extent in the credit extension data. Nevertheless, tentative signs of restraint are evident. Twelve-month growth in the banks' loans and advances extended to the private sector has continued at a brisk pace. This rate declined from 27,7 per cent in June 2007 to 25,0 per cent in August. This trend is also observed if securitisation transactions are adjusted for, although at a higher level. Twelve-month growth in loans and advances to the household sector has continued its downward trend, measuring 20,9 per cent in August compared to 21,7 per cent in June. Growth in loans and advances to the corporate sector also showed signs of moderation from high levels when it increased by 30,1 per cent in August compared to 35,4 per cent in July. There has also been some moderation in output growth, with GDP growing at an annualised rate of 4,5 per cent in the second quarter of 2007. This rate is in line with our estimates of potential output growth. The slowdown was mainly a result of slower growth momentum in the manufacturing sector which grew at an annualised rate of 0,5 per cent. The Investec/BER Purchasing Managers Index, which declined in August and September, indicates that this sector is likely to remain under pressure in the coming months. This overall trend is also confirmed by the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index which, although still high, has declined to its lowest level in three-and-a-half years. Despite evidence of a slowdown, growth is expected to be sustained at levels around potential, underpinned by continued strong investment expenditure. The exchange rate of the rand has continued to display a degree of resilience. The rand had initially depreciated in the wake of the turbulence in international financial markets. At the previous MPC meeting the rand was at a level of around R7,45 against the US dollar, compared to a level of around R6,80 in July. The depreciation of the US dollar against a number of major currencies, particularly the euro, resulted in the rand exchange rate returning to levels prevailing in July. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand has depreciated by about 2,3 per cent since the beginning of the year, but has appreciated by 6 per cent since the last meeting of the MPC. Developments in the exchange rate of the rand can be ascribed in part to capital inflows, strong commodity prices and the favourable outlook for the South African economy. During August, at the height of the global financial market turbulence, non-resident net purchases of South African bonds and shares totaled R32 billion, although in September the net purchases were negligible. The deficit on the current account of the balance of payments which had measured 6,5 per cent of GDP in the second quarter of 2007 continued to be financed comfortably. Furthermore, the Bank was able to increase the level of official gross gold and other foreign exchange reserves to US$30,5 billion at the end of September, while the international liquidity position improved to US$28,4 billion. On the international front, although uncertainties still remain, financial market turbulence appears to have subsided somewhat. The longer-term impact on the global growth outlook is still unclear, but some slowdown in the United States economy in particular can be expected. Nevertheless continued robust growth in Asia is expected to underpin commodity prices. World inflation is expected to remain under control despite a slight upward adjustment in inflation expectations. Having considered the above developments and in particular the risks which are on the upside, the MPC has decided to adjust the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 10,5 per cent per annum with effect from Friday, 12 October 2007. The MPC is determined to ensure that inflation returns to within the target range."
Peru,2007-10-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2007 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 5.0% The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 5.0 percent. The Board continues to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, distinguishing the factors with temporary impacts from those with permanent effects. Therefore, should expectations about inflation increase or should domestic demand grow at a faster pace than productive capacity and productivity gains, the Bank will adopt additional preventive adjustments in the reference interest rate. The Board made this decision considering the following macroeconomic information: The Consumer Price Index for Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.61 percent in September and accumulated 2.80 percent over the last 12 months, within the monetary target range (2 percent, plus or minus one percentage point). Core inflation indicator of the inflation trend was 0.19 percent and accumulated 2.15 percent over the last twelve months. Last 12-month inflation should transitorily be in the upper band of the inflation target (3.0 percent), mainly as a result of a higher imported inflation, particularly in terms of inputs used for the production of food products. These shocks have temporary impacts on inflation and therefore inflation is expected to converge thereafter to the inflation target (2.0 percent), as in previous similar episodes. Inflation expectations for 2008 and 2009, as reflected in the surveys carried out with firms, financial entities and economic analysts, remain around the monetary policy inflation target of 2.0 percent. Economic activity continues to show a robust growth: GDP grew 7.9 percent and domestic demand grew 10.9 percent during the first seven months of this year. In September the nuevo sol appreciated 0.4 percent against the currency basket of our main trading partners, although the domestic currency has depreciated 0.48 percent so far this year.

Turkiye,2007-10-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate from 17.25 to 16.75 percent, and lending rate from 22.25 to 21.50 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. from 13.25 to 12.75 percent, lending rate from 25.25 to 24.50 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions from 21.25 to 20.50 percent. Readings on economic activity and inflation are in line with the outlook presented in the July Inflation Report. While private consumption and investment demand exhibits signs of recovery, external demand moderates. Aggregate demand conditions continue to support the disinflation process. Services inflation continues its favorable course. Notwithstanding the risks related to energy, food, and administered prices, inflation is expected to decelerate owing to the lagged effects of strong monetary tightening. The Committee closely monitors the developments in international liquidity conditions and credit markets. September rate cut decision led to a significant fall in both the medium and long- term interest rates, reducing the downward risks on medium term inflation posed by global economic developments. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to continue the measured rate cuts. The Committee underlines that the current level of the short-term interest rates remains restrictive even after the recent policy rate cuts. The Committee assesses that, under the current policy stance envisaging a measured and cautious rate cut cycle, the risks on attaining the inflation target in the medium term are balanced. The timing and extent of further easing will depend on the incoming information regarding global liquidity conditions, external demand, public expenditures and other determinants of the medium term inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook will lead the Committee to reconsider its stance. Considering the downward trend in interest rates, the Committee decided to narrow the gap between borrowing and lending rates in order to limit the extent of potential fluctuations in overnight interest rates. In this regard, borrowing rates are reduced by 50 basis points, while lending rates are cut by 75 basis points. It should be noted, however, that the additional cut in lending rates is merely a technical adjustment. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days.

Czech Republic,2007-10-25,"Press Conference of the CNB Bank Board 10th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 25 October 2007 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast After discussing the situation report, the Board decided by a majority vote to leave the CNB two-week repo rate unchanged at 3.25%. Five members voted in favour of this decision and two members voted for increasing rates by 0.25 of a percentage point. Comparison wwiitthh tthhee JJuullyy ffoorreeccaasstt Compared to the July forecast, the rate of growth is lower in 2008. Unlike in the July forecast, the effect of the real economy will be slightly anti-inflationary in 2008. At the end of 2009, however, it will be modestly inflationary again. Compared to the July forecast, inflation is substantially higher in 2008 due to one-off factors  primarily increases in administered prices and tax rates. At the monetary policy horizon (2008 4Q  2009 Q1), inflation lies initially above the upper boundary of the tolerance band for the inflation target, falling into the upper part of the band thereafter. Monetary-policy relevant inflation (i.e. inflation adjusted for the first- round effects of changes in indirect taxes) is, on the contrary, below the July forecast and slightly above the inflation target. Major risks and uncertainties: - second-round impacts of tax changes - faster growth in food prices - stronger CZK/EUR exchange rate - slower economic growth abroad (relative to existing projections)."
Hungary,2007-10-29,"At its meeting on 29 October 2007, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to maintain the central bank base rate at 7.50%. In the light of fresh economic data released since the previous policy meeting, the Monetary Council continues to assume that the Bank's 3% medium-term inflation target will be met in 2009, in which the rate of growth remaining weak by the standard of recent years will play a role. However, a necessary condition for meeting the inflation target is that one-off price increases should not lead to a sustained rise in expectations. Based on the latest information available, the Bank expects food prices to rise significantly over the short term. Food price inflation can be related in part to worse-than-usual weather conditions; however, the sustained increase in international demand may also play a part, and therefore, it may also affect the medium-term prospects for inflation. But other core inflation components do not point to further inflationary pressure. Private sector wage inflation eased back in August, mainly explained by employers in 2006 bringing forward bonus payments in anticipation of changes in regulations. Consequently, annual wage growth is expected to be very volatile over the remainder of the year. After adjusting for these factors, the outlook is for wage growth to ease gradually. Further moderation in nominal wage growth is a prerequisite for sustained low inflation. Wage increases consistent with productivity gains reduce the risks that a series of shocks to inflation from agriculture, energy prices and other demand factors could lead to a higher rate of price increases over a protracted period and inflation expectations could become stuck at high levels. Recent financial market developments suggest that the international turbulence stemming from problems in the US mortgage market has so far had a temporary effect on market sentiment towards forint-denominated investments. The current macroeconomic and financial environment may leave scope for the Council to reduce the base rate; however, considering the upside risks to inflation and uncertainty surrounding the global investment climate, the Monetary Council will continue to exercise care in setting interest rates."
Israel,2007-10-29,"29.10.2007 The Bank of Israel interest rate for November 2007 remains unchanged at 4 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for November 2007 will remain unchanged at 4 percent. This is consistent with the policy of maintaining price stability, as expressed by the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell in September by 0.5 percent, in line with the forecasts. In the last twelve months the CPI has risen by 1.4 percent, and since the beginning of the year by 2.3 percent. In the third quarter of 2007 prices, particularly domestic prices, as calculated by the Bank of Israel, continued rising, but at a more moderate pace than in the first two quarters. At the same time, prices of imported goods rose in the third quarter due both to the depreciation of the shekel againstthe dollar that started in the middle of the second quarter, and the rise in commodity prices worldwide. Inflation forecasts: Israeli forecasters expect, on average, that the inflation rate for 2007 will reach 2.3 percent, and that inflation over the next 12 months will be 1.9 percent. At the same time they expect, on average, that the Bank of Israel's interest rate in a year's time will be 4.3 percent. The expectation of inflation over the next 12 months derived from rates of return in the capital market is around 1.2 percent, and, basedon financial markets data, the interest rate is expected to rise by 0.5 percentage points in 2008. The Bank of Israel's models indicate that assumingthe interest rate remains for now at 4 percent and the exchange rate staysat its current level, inflation twelve months from now will be close to the middle of the target range. Real economic activity: The trend in economic growth of recent years continued in the first half of 2007 and is expected to continue in the second half too. According to the latest estimates of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). GDP is expected to grow by 5.2 percent in 2007. According to the Bank of Israel forecasts. GDP is expected to grow in 2008 by more than 4 percent. There are, though, data that point to a possible deceleration in economic activity: for example, the composite state-of-the-economy index which rose in September by 0.3 percent, as a result of the fall in the manufacturing output index for August. However it is too early to determine the significance of such data for the trend in economic growth. Labor market and wages: According to the Labor Force Survey trends, the rate of unemployment in July-August stood at 7.8 percent, compared to 7.7 percent in the preceding months. National Insurance data indicate a continued rise in the number of salaried employees and a more moderate increase in wages. In the period May-July, real wages rose by 3 percent compared to theparallel period of last year, down from 3.5 percent in the period February-April. At the same time, the trend of rising unit labor costs which began in the third quarter of 2006 continued in the third quarter of 2007. Budget policy: The budget performance so far this year is consistent with a deficit of less than 1 percent of GDP in 2007. The cumulative government budget surplus since the beginning of the year stands at NIS 7.7 billion,compared to a surplus of NIS 2.6 billion in the corresponding period of last year. The proposed budget for 2008, which was approved by the governmentin August, and which passed its first reading in the Knesset, is consistent with the government's multi-year budgetary targets. Forex market: Since the previous interest rate decision on September 23 up till October 28, the shekel strengthened by 1.1 percent against the dollar and weakened by 0.6 percent against the euro. The strengthening of the shekel against the dollar was supported by nonresidents' sale of foreign currency through short-term instruments and the continued inflow of long-term capital. The underlying forces acting to strengthen the shekel--the surplus in the current account of the balance of payments and foreign investment in the economy--continue to operate. Capital market: Since the previous interest rate decision the Tel Aviv 25 share index rose by 11 percent. At the same time the yield on 10-year unindexed government bonds remained stable around the level of 5.6 percent. The gap between yields on 10-year unindexed government bonds in Israel and on 10-year US government bonds widened to 1.3 percentage points from 1 percentage point in the previous month. This widening stemmed mainly from the fall in yields in the US. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread continued to fall, from 0.3 percent at the time of the previous discussion to 0.22 percent. Global background conditions: The repercussions of the crisis in the financial markets that began in July continued in the past month. Despite the partial recovery seen in the financial markets, pressure remains in some ofthem. Financing difficulties created following the crisis have declined but still exist, and are slowing down the rate of recovery in the markets. Atthe same time the degree of uncertainty over global growth continues. The International Monetary Fund revised its forecast of global growth downward for 2008 while leaving its forecast for 2007 unchanged. Increases in food and oil prices point to the risk of higher inflation around the world. Despite this, the financial markets expect that the US Fed will cut its federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each of its next two meetings, while the central banks of Europe and Japan are expected to leave their interest ratesunchanged at their next meetings. The main considerations behind the decision There are currently opposing forces acting on inflation. On the one hand, domestic prices are rising in Israel against a background of continued rapid growth, and with it, a narrowing output gap, together with rising prices of certain imported goods following the rise in energy and food prices worldwide. On the other hand, it is expected that prices affected by developments in the exchange rate will become more moderated against a background of continued weakness in the dollar worldwide and the expected cut in the Fed interest rate. As a result, the current level of interest rate is consistent with the achievement of the inflation target over the coming twelve months. This is based on assessments derived from the capital market, from private forecasters, and from the Bank of Israel's models. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. 29.10.2007 The Bank of Israel interest rate for November 2007 remains unchanged at 4 percent.

MSS and the Central Governments' cash balances taken together increased to Rs.2,22,582 crore by October 24, 2007 from Rs.85,770 crore at end-March 2007. •The Government of India, in consultation with the Reserve Bank, revised the ceiling under MSS for the year 2007-08 from Rs.1,10,000 crore to Rs.1,50,000 crore on August 8, 2007 and further to Rs.2,00,000 crore on October 4, 2007. During the second quarter of 2007-08, financial markets remained generally stable with conditions of abundant liquidity and interest rates moderated in almost all segments of the financial system. During AprilOctober 2007, public sector banks (PSBs) decreased their deposit rates, particularly at the upper end of the range for various maturities, by 25-60 basis points. During April-October 2007, the benchmark prime lending rates (BPLRs) of private sector banks moved from a range of 12.50-17.25 per cent to 13.00-16.50 per cent. The range of BPLRs for PSBs and foreign banks, however, remained unchanged at 12.50-13.50 per cent and 10.00-15.50 per cent, respectively, during this period. The gross market borrowings of the Central Government through dated securities at Rs.1,27,060 crore (Rs.1,17,548 crore a year ago) during 2007-08 so far (up to October 26) constituted 67.3 per cent of the budget estimates (BE) while net market borrowings at Rs.75,387 crore (Rs.65,951 crore a year ago) constituted 68.7 per cent of the BE.

Global Developments The downside risks to the global economic outlook have increased from a few months ago, accentuated by the recent financial market turmoil, firm inflationary pressures and high and volatile crude prices. According to the IMF's World Economic Outlook (WEO) released in October 2007, the forecast for global real GDP growth on a purchasing power parity basis has been retained at 5.2 per cent for 2007 as in the July 2007 update, down from 5.4 per cent in 2006, but forecast for 2008 has been revised down to 4.8 per cent in October from 5.2 per cent in the July 2007 update. In the US, real GDP growth had risen to 3.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2007 as compared with 2.4 per cent a year ago - The IMF's October 2007 WEO expects the US economy to grow at 1.9 per cent in 2007 and 2008 as against 2.9 per cent in 2006. There was a sudden fall in credit market confidence in late July brought on by the spread of risks from exposure to the US sub-prime mortgages with credit crunch spreading into corporate bond markets and equity markets. The European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve, which have intervened since August 9 by providing liquidity to the inter-bank market, were joined by central banks in Canada. Japan. Australia. Norway and Switzerland. •Bank of England has provided liquidity support to a mortgage lending bank, while giving a blanket guarantee to depositors on the safety of their deposits. Several central banks have cut policy rates during the third quarter of 2007 after financial markets were significantly affected by turbulence, such as the US Federal Reserve, the Banco Central do Brasil. Bank Indonesia (BI) and the Bank of Thailand. The central banks that have tightened their policy rates include the European Central Bank; the Bank of England; the Bank of Japan; the Bank of Canada; the Reserve Bank of Australia; the Reserve Bank of New Zealand; the People's Bank of China; the Bank of Korea; the Banco de Mexico; and the Banco Central de Chile. •A few central banks in Asia have used supplementary measures for tightening, besides increasing key policy rates. The only central bank that has kept policy rates steady is the Bank Negara Malaysia. Overall Assessment Some positive elements in the global economy are the global economy is strong and resilient; EMEs, by and large, have a better macro-environment than before; globally, corporate balance sheets are strong and less leveraged than in the past; large financial intermediaries are perhaps adequately capitalised to absorb the shocks of credit infirmities; and the inflation environment has been, on the whole, benign.5 The global environment is fraught with uncertainties with international crude prices at new highs, having breached the level of US $ 90 per barrel while elevated food and metal prices would, in current circumstances, pass through to domestic inflation. The US Federal Reserve has been the most aggressive in terms of easing monetary policy, with a higher than expected rate cut, reflecting the concerns over impact of housing issues on consumption and, hence, growth. The most important issue for India is the possible impact of global financial market developments and policy responses by central banks in major economies. The immediate task for public policy in India, therefore, is to manage the possible financial contagion which is in an incipient stage with highly uncertain prospects of being resolved soon. On the domestic front, aggregate demand conditions have remained firm and on the uptrend. Key monetary aggregates, i.e., reserve money and money supply have been running well above initial projections, reflecting the impact of higher than expected deposit growth and the exogenous expansionary effects of capital inflows as well as the drawdown of fiscal cash balances. The incomplete pass-through of international prices of crude, metals, food and commodities in general to consumer prices is indicative of suppressed inflation which carries destabilising potential into the future. The policy responses in the form of active liquidity management operations to modulate expansionary monetary and financial conditions were reflected in a generally orderly evolution of market liquidity. Since late July, global financial markets have experienced unusual volatility, strained liquidity and heightened risk aversion. While the trigger was the rising default rates on sub-prime mortgages in the US, the source of the problem was significant mis-pricing of risks in the financial system. Easy monetary policy, globalisation of liquidity flows, wide-spread use of highly complex structured debt instruments and inadequacy of banking supervision in coping with financial innovations also contributed to the severity of the crisis. At the current juncture and looking ahead, on the domestic front, the biggest challenge for monetary policy is the management of capital flows and the attendant implications for liquidity and overall stability. Yet another challenge is the rapid escalation in asset prices, particularly equity and real estate, which are significantly driven by capital flows. Over the next twelve to eighteen months, risks to inflation and inflation expectations would also continue to demand priority in policy monitoring.6 Stance of Monetary Policy Real GDP growth in 2007-08 is placed at 8.5 per cent for policy purposes, as set out in the Annual Policy Statement of April 2007 and reiterated in the First Quarter Review. Policy endeavour would be to contain inflation close to 5.0 per cent in 2007-08 and the resolve, going forward, would be to condition expectations in the range of 4.0- 4.5 per cent so that an inflation rate of 3.0 per cent becomes a medium-term objective. Moderating the expansionary effects of net capital flows is warranted so that money supply is not persistently out of alignment with the indicative projections. The Reserve Bank will continue with its policy of active demand management of liquidity through appropriate use of the CRR stipulations and open market operations (OMO) including the MSS and the LAF, using all the policy instruments at its disposal flexibly, as and when the situation warrants. Barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy including the outlook for inflation, the overall stance of monetary policy in the period ahead will broadly continue to be: To reinforce the emphasis on price stability and well-anchored inflation expectations while ensuring a monetary and interest rate environment that supports export and investment demand in the economy so as to enable continuation of the growth momentum. To re-emphasise credit quality and orderly conditions in financial markets for securing macroeconomic and, in particular, financial stability while simultaneously pursuing greater credit penetration and financial inclusion. To respond swiftly with all possible measures as appropriate to the evolving global and domestic situation impinging on inflation expectations, financial stability and the growth momentum. To be in readiness to take recourse to all possible options for maintaining stability and the growth momentum in the economy in view of the unusual heightened global uncertainties, and the unconventional policy responses to the developments in financial markets. Monetary Measures The Bank Rate has been kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent. The repo rate under the LAF is kept unchanged at 7.75 per cent. The reverse repo rate under the LAF is kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent. The Reserve Bank has the flexibility to conduct repo/reverse repo auctions at a fixed rate or at variable rates as circumstances warrant.7 The Reserve Bank retains the option to conduct overnight or longer term repo/reverse repo under the LAF depending on market conditions and other relevant factors. The Reserve Bank will continue to use this flexibility including the right to accept or reject tender(s) under the LAF, wholly or partially, if deemed fit, so as to make efficient use of the LAF in daily liquidity management. Developmental and Regulatory Policies Financial Markets Non-Competitive Bidding Scheme in the Auctions of State Development Loans (SDLs) to be operationalised by March 31, 2008. Re-issuance of SDLs in the second half of 2007-08. The facility of new issuance structure for floating rate bonds (FRBs) is being built into the new Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) auction system being developed by the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL). The Reserve Bank is committed for permitting market repos in corporate bonds, once the corporate debt markets develop and the Reserve Bank is assured of availability of fair prices, and an efficient and safe settlement system based on delivery versus payment (DvP) III and Straight Through Processing (STP) is in place. The facility of permitting all exporters to earn interest on their Exchange Earners' Foreign Currency (EEFC) accounts to the extent of outstanding balances of US $ 1 million per exporter is extended up to October 31, 2008 and banks are free to determine the rate of interest.

Malaysia,2007-10-30,"At its meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. Malaysia's domestic economic fundamentals continue to remain sound with sustained growth in domestic demand. However, downside risks to global growth and trade have increased in recent months due to higher oil prices and the uncertainty in the global financial markets. While this will pose a risk to the Malaysian growth outlook, the strength of domestic fundamentals will have a mitigating role in reducing the impact. Inflation over the medium term is expected to be affected by rising global food and commodity prices. However, at below two percent, the current inflation rate is among the lowest in the region. While further upward price adjustments may occur, overall inflation is still expected to be contained. With the economy growing below potential, the prospect for demand induced pressures on prices is also reduced. Furthermore, in the event that global growth is lower than currently projected, it would have a mitigating effect on global prices. Given the current uncertainty surrounding future trends in factors affecting inflation and global growth, the stance of monetary policy going forward will be determined by new data and information and its implications on the medium-term prospects for price stability and economic growth. Bank Negara Malaysia 30 October 2007."
Poland,2007-10-31,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 31 October 2007 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 30-31 October 2007 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate 4.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 6.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 3.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 5.00% on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of strong growth encompassing all its sectors. The data released since the last meeting of the Council confirm previous assessments that strong, though slightly weaker than previously expected, economic activity should be sustained for at least next few quarters. The continuation of fast economic growth in Poland should be supported by the still strong activity in the world economy. In the period August-September, however, turbulences in the global financial markets occurred. These turbulences resulted in a slight lowering of growth forecasts of the US and euro-area economies. In September the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland was higher than previously expected reaching 2.3%. Thus, inflation rate was close to the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. The Council got acquainted with the NBP staff projection of inflation and GDP based on the ECMOD model; the projection is one of the inputs into the Council's decision-making on NBP interest rates. The forecasted annual growth of consumer prices in the October projection is lower than expected in the July projection till the middle of 2008, while starting from the second half of 2008 onwards it is slightly higher than expected in July. Under constant interest rates, there is a 50- percent probability that inflation will remain within the range of 2.2-2.3% in 2007 (compared to 2.2-2.5% in the July projection), 2.2-3.5% in 2008 (compared to 2.1-3.8%) and 2.5-4.6% in 2009 (compared to 2.1-4.3%). According to the October ECMOD-based projection, the annual GDP growth will remain, with 50-percent probability, within the range of 6.5-6.6% in 2007 (compared to 6.2-6.8% in the July projection), 4.4-6.2% in 2008 (compared to 4.3-6.7%) and 3.8-6.7% in 2009 (compared to 4.0- 7.2%). The Council also got acquainted with other forecasts conducted at the NBP. In the Council's assessment, in the coming quarters economic growth will most probably continue to exceed the growth of potential GDP. The latest information on labour market ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, developments points to a continuation of a high wage growth and further deterioration in the relation between wage and labour productivity growth. A further build-up in wage pressure and, consequently, inflationary pressure is possible. The risk of inflation increase is also raised by food price growth observed in the world economy. Moreover, the recently made decisions leading to a decrease in revenues and an increase in expenditures of the public finance sector may lead to a deterioration of the public finance balance, which in the medium run may result in additional inflationary pressure. The mid-term increase in inflation may be curbed by the continuing very good financial results of enterprises and high investment growth conducive to productivity growth. The increase in inflation may also be constrained by low growth of external prices related to globalisation and the ensuing increased competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services. The inflationary pressure may also be reduced by a possible slowdown of the global economy. In the Council's assessment, in the medium term the probability of inflation running above the inflation target decreased to a certain degree due to the previously implemented monetary policy tightening, though it is still higher than the probability of inflation running below the target. A more comprehensive assessment of the scale of the risk of inflation overshooting the inflation target will only be possible after analysing the data released in the future. The Council will be closely monitoring the growth and structure of domestic demand, including the degree of the expansionary fiscal policy stance, developments of the current account balance, the relation between wage and labour productivity growth, zloty exchange rate, the impact of globalisation on the economy and on food prices.

Romania,2007-10-31,"In its meeting of October 31, 2007, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. According to statistical data, year-on-year inflation rose to 6.03 percent in September mainly due to a steep increase in food prices and an adverse impact of the correction in the leu exchange rate against the background of recent turbulence on world financial markets. Beyond the anticipated base effect, this year's severe drought has a detrimental impact on both food prices - which also increased following significant rises of these prices on world markets - and on the dynamics of GDP, which reveals the volatile annual performance of Romania's agricultural sector. The broader analysis of economic developments shows a relative slowdown of economic growth, attributable to the negative supply-side shock triggered by farming sector output, with consumption remaining at unsustainable levels, as also revealed by the persistent worsening of Romania's external deficit. Credit expansion has stayed alert in the context of renewed fast growth of foreign currency lending, which accounted for 51.5 percent of the end-September stock of non-government credit. The monetary policy stance, assessed via broad monetary conditions, remained prudent in the context of a pre-emptive tightening of money market liquidity control and of the maintenance of restrictive minimum reserve requirements. The persistence of negative supply-side effects, high household income dynamics, the projected rise in public spending towards year-end, as well as uncertainties over leu exchange rate movements signal that end-2007 inflation will exceed the upper limit of the 3-5 percent target band. However, average annual inflation, estimated at around 4.7 percent versus 6.56 percent in 2006, shows a consolidation of the disinflation process this year. Nevertheless, the risk of a prolonged deviation of inflation from the target through part of 2008 tends to diminish the favourable impact of this consolidation and to affect the inflation expectations of corporates and households. Therefore, the NBR is stressing that monetary policy, along with all components of the macroeconomic policy mix, should ensure a firm and sustainable anchoring of inflation expectations at the low levels achieved as yet, in order to bring annual price growth within the medium-term disinflation trajectory agreed with the Government and, on a broader horizon, to achieve the convergence of Romania's aggregate price level towards price stability, as defined by the EU. Such a stance of all components of the macroeconomic policy mix is all the more necessary given that the external deficit registers levels difficult to sustain on a longer term in the context of heightened uncertainties that affect the world economy. Thus, in light of available data, the NBR Board has decided to raise the monetary policy rate to 7.5 percent per annum from 7.0 percent and to continue to pursue prudent liquidity management via open-market operations. This monetary policy orientation seeks also to ensure an appropriate real interest rate level aimed at stimulating savings and improving the savings-investment ratio, with an impact on the gradual reduction of the external deficit. Moreover, given the fast increase in all components of non-government credit, the NBR Board has also decided to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic context and inflation outlook, as well as the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference scheduled for November 5, 2007. The new forecast of the medium-term economic developments underscores heightened and more complex risks, especially those related to a rise in incomes insufficiently supported by productivity gains, higher public spending in the run-up to successive forthcoming elections and uncertainties over investors' appetite for emerging markets risk. Therefore, the NBR reiterates that it will vigilantly monitor developments in macroeconomic indicators and their outlook, both domestically and internationally, standing ready to adjust its instrument settings in order to achieve medium-term disinflation objectives in a sustainable manner and make further advance in the convergence process with the European Union. The next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for January 7, 2008."
United States,2007-10-31,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4-1/2 percent. Economic growth was solid in the third quarter, and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance. However, the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term, partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction. Today's action, combined with the policy action taken in September, should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation. In this context, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. The Committee judges that, after this action, the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Charles L Evans; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Frederic S Mishkin; William Poole; Eric S Rosengren; and Kevin M Warsh. Voting against was Thomas M Hoenig, who preferred no change in the federal funds rate at this meeting. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 5 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York. Richmond. Atlanta. Chicago. St. Louis, and San Francisco."
Egypt,2007-11-01,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release November 1, 2007 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 875 percent per annu. In its meeting held on November 1, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and lending rates at 875 percent and 1075 percent, respectivel. Based on the old CPI series, the annual headline CPI inflation inched-up to 88 percent (y/y) in September compared to 845 percent in Augus. The increase during the past two months was chiefly driven by the rise in domestic food prices on the back of accelerating international prices, particularly wheat, maize, and edible oi. Food inflation rose from 128 percent (y/y) in August to 133 percent in Septembe. The propagation of the recent inflationary shocks to other non-food prices and the inflationary demand pressures from higher economic growth exert upward pressure on inflatio. Over the medium-term, this has the potential to drive inflation above the upper level of the CBE's comfort zon. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation and the recent developments in international financial markets, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Euroarea,2007-11-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our previous meeting fully confirms that the outlook for price stability over the medium term is subject to upside risks. Against this background, and with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area, our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our mandate. The economic fundamentals of the euro area remain sound and support a favourable medium-term outlook for economic activity. However, the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets has led to continued uncertainty. This warrants a thorough examination of additional information before drawing further conclusions for monetary policy in the context of our medium term-oriented monetary policy strategy focused on maintaining price stability. Accordingly, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. By acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability, which is all the more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty. This will favour an environment conducive to sustained economic growth, well-functioning markets and job creation. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. On the basis of the available data, it appears that the sustained real economic growth experienced in the euro area in the first half of 2007 has continued through the third quarter, as reflected in the data for industrial production and retail sales that have been released since our meeting in early October. While financial market volatility seems to have contributed to a decline in euro area consumer and business confidence indicators in the past few months, these indicators generally remain above their historical averages and continue to point to ongoing sustained growth. Overall, the fundamentals of the euro area remain sound, including in particular sustained corporate earnings and profitability, robust employment growth and falling unemployment to levels not seen for 25 years. Available forecasts for 2008 continue to confirm our main scenario of real GDP growing at around trend potential. This scenario is based on the expectation that the global economy will remain resilient, with the slowdown of economic growth in the United States partly offset by the sustained strength of emerging market economies. Continued strong external demand should provide ongoing support to euro area exports and investment. Consumption growth in the euro area should also contribute to economic growth, in line with developments in real disposable income, as continued employment growth provides supportive conditions. That said, in view of the potential impact of prolonged financial market volatility and the re-pricing of risk on the real economy, the level of uncertainty surrounding this broadly favourable outlook for economic activity remains high. On balance, risks to the outlook for growth are judged to lie on the downside. These downside risks relate mainly to the potential for a broader impact from the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on confidence and financing conditions, further oil and commodity price rises, as well as concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, the annual HICP inflation rate increased very strongly to 2.6% in October 2007, from 2.1% in September. This sharp increase is a matter of particular concern and it is essential that it does not affect medium to longer-term inflation expectations. To that effect, we have already indicated on previous occasions that we are now in a period during which unfavourable effects from energy prices will have a strong upward impact on annual HICP inflation rates, owing mainly to the marked decline in energy prices a year ago. In addition, these effects have been strengthened by recent substantial further increases in oil, non-oil commodity and, in particular, food prices. Overall, we expect the HICP inflation rate to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months before moderating again in the course of 2008. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments are fully confirmed to lie on the upside. These risks include the possibility of persistently high oil and agricultural prices, continuing the strong momentum observed in recent months, as well as unanticipated increases in administered prices and indirect taxes. Moreover, taking into account the existence of capacity constraints, the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters, and the positive signs from labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage developments may occur. Furthermore, an increase in pricing power in market segments with low competition could materialise. It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects be avoided. In addition, the explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices should be reduced and ultimately eliminated. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. The strength of both money and credit growth in recent months  with the annual growth rates of M3 and MFI loans to the private sector both at more than 11% in September  may have been influenced by a number of temporary or special factors, such as the flattening of the yield curve and the recent financial market volatility. However, even taking into account these special factors, the underlying rate of money and credit expansion remains strong. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring so as to detect underlying trends on the one hand and to better understand shorter-term dynamics on the other. This monitoring will provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets. A broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important given recent financial market developments, since financial volatility may influence the short-term behaviour of money-holders and thereby affect monetary developments. Monetary and credit data can therefore offer an important insight into how financial institutions, households and firms have responded to the financial market volatility. Indeed, previous episodes of heightened financial market uncertainty have been associated with large portfolio shifts into safe and liquid monetary assets. For the time being, however, there is little evidence that such shifts have influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates since the onset of financial market volatility in early August, although specific balance sheet items, such as holdings of money market fund shares/units, may have been strongly affected. The rate of growth of bank loans to households and non-financial corporations has remained robust in recent months, tentatively suggesting that there is no impairment in credit supply. However, it cannot be excluded that the strong loan flows partly reflect the re-intermediation of some financing onto bank balance sheets given illiquidity in some segments of the asset-backed securities markets. Further data and analysis will be required to develop a more complete view of the impact of the financial market volatility on bank balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. To sum up, a cross-check of the information identified under the economic analysis with the outcome of the monetary analysis has fully confirmed the existence of upside risks to price stability over the medium term, with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area, and against the background of sound economic fundamentals in the euro area. At the same time, given the continued uncertainty, additional information is needed before further conclusions for monetary policy can be drawn. Consequently, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. Our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our mandate. By acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment, we will ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability, which is all the more important in the current context. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the period to come. Turning to fiscal policy, the Governing Council welcomes the ECOFIN Council's agreement to strengthen the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Governing Council also welcomes the recent confirmation by the ECOFIN Council of a reinforcement of its commitment to the full implementation of the Pact. In particular, the provisions of the preventive arm, including the call for a structural adjustment of at least 0.5% of GDP per annum, need to be adhered to by all countries with fiscal imbalances. In this regard, 2008 budget plans in a number of countries point to a pro-cyclical fiscal stance and an unwarranted relaxation of consolidation efforts. This gives rise to concern as consolidation shortfalls undermine in particular the Eurogroup agreement to achieve sound budgetary positions by 2010 at the latest. With regard to structural reforms, the Governing Council stresses that a key effect of well-designed structural reforms is a sustainable improvement in the employment and income situation of workers and households. Reforms which increase the incentives for firms and individuals to invest in human capital tend to enhance overall labour demand and productivity. Reducing non-wage labour costs would also enhance employment and the net income levels of workers. Moreover, labour market regulations should not discourage firms from offering jobs, or workers from accepting them. It is encouraging to see that past labour market reforms have contributed to job creation and reduced unemployment. It is important that governments continue in this direction and do not reverse past reforms just at the point when they are starting to bear fruit. Moreover, the Governing Council reiterates its full support for all efforts which foster market flexibility and enhance competition. Against the background of a marked increase in international food commodity prices, further liberalisation and reforms in EU agricultural markets would help to enhance their efficiency and benefit European consumers through lower prices."
South Korea,2007-11-08,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. The domestic economy seems likely to maintain its upward trend. While the expansion of investment has slowed down, exports continue to post robust growth and private consumption shows a steady increase. The uncertainty surrounding future economic developments, however, is increasing mainly due to the rises in international oil prices and the prolonged international financial market unrest. While consumer price inflation remains broadly stable, upward pressures are increasing somewhat mainly due to high oil prices. The upward trend of real estate prices has flattened out. In the financial markets, there is ample liquidity and financial institutions' lending continues to show a steady increase."
Chile,2007-11-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 November 2007 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5.75% (annual). In the last few weeks, the perception of world financial markets with respect to problems associated to the subprime lending crisis has deteriorated, and the US dollar has depreciated further against most currencies. In addition, reduced dynamism is foreseen for industrialized economies. In a different area, the oil price has risen considerably, while the prices of copper and several food products remain high, all exceeding projections. This configures an external scenario relevant to the Chilean economy that, while still positive, now poses a larger risk of adverse international conditions. Domestically, the available information indicates that output growth in the third quarter was lower than forecast in the last Monetary Policy Report, a situation that goes beyond the performance of a few specific sectors, whose persistence is still uncertain. Regarding domestic demand, indicators suggest that the dynamism of investment has remained stable and that of consumption has dropped. Salaried employment continues to rise and domestic financial conditions are somewhat less favorable. Annual CPI inflation stands above 6% and is projected to remain high for several months to later descend toward the target. The prices of some foods, both perishable and non-perishable, are showing early signs of reversal. The drop in the prices of other relatively volatile products also contributed to the low monthly IPCX1 inflation rate (that excludes fuels, perishables y some regulated utilities). Medium- and long-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored around 3% annually, which is consistent with a temporary rise in inflation. The future path of the monetary policy interest rate will depend on incoming information and its implications on projected inflation. Of particular importance will be the developments in the international scenario, the potential propagation of recent inflationary shocks to other prices—especially the path of wages—, medium-term inflation expectations and the evolution of the output gap. * The Spanish original prevails."
Philippines,2007-11-14,"The Monetary Board today decided to reduce by 25 basis points the BSP's key policy interest rates to 5.50 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 7.50 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility, effective Friday, 16 November 2007. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts were also reduced accordingly. This is the second time in two months that a reduction in policy rate has been implemented. In deciding to cut policy rates further, the Monetary Board considered the continuing benign inflation outlook. Inflation is expected to fall well below the 4.0-5.0 percent target range in 2007 and to remain within the lower bound of the 4.0 percent + 1 percentage point target in 2008. Liquidity growth continued to slow down for the fifth consecutive month in September; risks pertaining to agricultural output have moderated; more recent regional wage adjustments are not expected to generate additional price pressures; and inflation expectations remain well anchored. In assessing the upside risks to inflation, the Monetary Board noted that these have remained manageable. Monetary measures implemented last May continue to temper the impact on domestic liquidity of the sustained strong foreign exchange inflows, while the firm peso has cushioned the effect of higher import prices of oil and food, among other commodities. The Monetary Board will continue to keep a watchful eye on global and domestic economic developments, particularly factors that could pose threats to the inflation target, mindful that price stability is essential to sustainable economic growth."
Turkiye,2007-11-14,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate from 16.75 to 16.25 percent, and lending rate from 21.50 to 20.75 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. from 12.75 to 12.25 percent, lending rate from 24.50 to 23.75 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions from 20.50 to 19.75 percent. Readings on economic activity and inflation are in line with the outlook presented in the October Inflation Report. While the demand for private consumption and investment displays recovery, external demand moderates. Aggregate demand conditions continue to support disinflation. In fact, inflation excluding food has maintained its favorable course. Yet, hikes in administered prices may delay the disinflation process in the short term. Notwithstanding the risks related to energy and food prices, inflation is expected to slow down in the medium term owing to the lagged effects of strong monetary tightening. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to cut the borrowing rates by 50 basis points, and lending rates by 75 basis points. It should be underlined that the current level of short-term interest rates remains restrictive even after the recent rate cuts. The Committee maintained the policy stance in the October Inflation Report, and assessed that the risks against attaining the inflation target in the medium run are balanced under a measured and cautious rate cut cycle. The potential second round effects of rising food and energy prices, however, should be closely monitored. The timing and extent of further easing will depend on incoming information regarding global liquidity conditions, external demand, public expenditures and other determinants of the medium term inflation outlook.

Inflation's recent increase above the target is basically associated with rises in the international prices of some basic food inputs. The Bank continues to keep a close watch on international economy developments and on their repercussions on inflation in the country. Therefore, should expectations about inflation increase or should domestic demand grow at a faster pace than productive capacity and productivity, the Bank will adopt any necessary preventive adjustments in the reference interest rate. The Board made this decision considering the following macroeconomic information: The Consumer Price Index for Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.31 percent in October and accumulated 3.1 percent over the last 12 months, a level above the monetary target range (2 percent, plus or minus one percentage point). Core inflation indicator of the inflation trend was 0.35 percent and accumulated 2.4 percent over the last twelve months. Imported inflation, indicator representing the part of inflation that is mainly determined by international prices, was 2.20 percent in October and was mainly due to the rise in the price of bread, given the increase observed in the international price of wheat. As a result of this, imported inflation showed a last 12- month rate of 9.18 percent. As pointed out in our Inflation Report of September, last 12-month inflation is expected to be transitorily above the upper band of the target range (3.0 percent) in the short-term, due mainly to a higher imported inflation rate, particularly in terms of inputs used for the production of food products. These shocks have temporary impacts on inflation and, therefore, inflation should converge thereafter to the target (2.0 percent), as in other similar episodes. As reflected in the surveys carried out with firms and economic analysts, inflation expectations for 2008 and 2009 remain around the monetary policy inflation target of 2.0 percent. Moreover, according to the surveys carried our with financial entities, inflation expectations for 2008 and 2009 are 2.6 and 2.5 percent respectively. Economic activity continues to show a robust growth: GDP grew 7.7 percent and domestic demand grew 10.9 percent during the first eight months of this year. The nuevo sol appreciated 2.9 percent against the dollar in October and 6.2 year- to-date. The exchange rate by the close of the month was 3.00 per dollar. Moreover, the nuevo sol appreciated 1.5 percent against the currency basket of our trading partners in October, and has appreciated 1.0 percent so far this year. The average monthly interest rate for the interbank market was 4.98 percent in October, close to the reference interest rate. The spread of the global bond (indicator of the country risk) closed at 136 bps. in October (137 bps. at end-September). Furthermore, the yield on the 20-year and 30-year sovereign bonds in soles closed at 6.3 and 6.5 percent respectively in October. In both cases, the interest rates on these bonds declined by 14 bps. compared to end September. During the session, the Board approved the annual interest rates on the following active and passive operations in soles between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.75 percent. Overnight deposits: 4.25 percent. Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the interest rates on the following operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage point. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.75 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 3.5 percent. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (December 2007) in the session to be held on December 6, 2007. 2."
Israel,2007-11-26,"26.11.2007 The Bank of Israel interest rate for December 2007 remains unchanged at 4 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for December 2007 will remain unchanged at 4 percent. This is consistent with the policy of maintaining price stability, as expressed by the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose in October by 0.1 percent, slightly higher than the forecasts. In the last twelve monthsthe CPI has risen by 2.2 percent, and since the beginning of the year by 2.4 percent. Inflation forecasts: Israeli forecasters expect, on average, thatthe 2007 inflation rate will reach 2.5 percent, and that inflation over the next 12 months will be 2.2 percent. At the same time they expect, on average, that the Bank of Israel's interest rate will rise by half a percentage point by the end of 2008. Expectations of inflation over the next 12 months derived from rates of return in the capital market are around 1.2 percent, the same as a month ago. Derived expectations of the Bank of Israel interest rate are that it will remain unchanged over the next few months. The Bank of Israel's models indicate that at the current level of interest, inflation over the next twelve months will be within the target range. Real economic activity: National Accounts data for the third quarter show that the growth trend continued. GDP grew by 6.1 percent inthat quarter, and business sector product by 6.6 percent. If the US economy slips into a recession in 2008 that results in a significant slowdown in world trade--the probability of which has risen in the lastfew weeks--GDP is expected to grow by only 3.6 percent in 20081. This compares with a 4.4 percent growth forecast if the US economy is only moderately affected by the crisis, in line with the IMF assessments of last October. The labor market and wages: Trend data of the rate of unemployment in August--the last month for which data are available--remained steady at 7.8 percent. On the other hand, the downward trend in the number of job seekers continued in September, supported bythe continuing increase in the number of employee posts: in June-August that number was 4.3 percent higher than in the equivalent period in 2006. The nominal wage was 2.6 percent higher in June-August this year than in June-August 2006. At the same time, the wage in the public sector rose by 3.4 percent. Most industries in the business sector also showed wage increases. Budget policy: The total budget surplus since the beginning of the year reached NIS 8.7 billion, and it is reasonable to expect that the budget this year will end close to balance. At a time when global economic developments and their effect on Israel's economy are unclear in light of the credit crisis, it is important that the budget framework, which played a major role in economic growth over the last few years, be strictly adhered to. Hence it is important that the proposed budget for 2008, which has been approved by the government and has passed its first reading in the Knesset, be passed in accordance with the budget guidelines to which itadheres. The forex market: Between the previous interest rate decision on October 28 and November 25, the dollar weakened by 3.4 percent against the shekel, and the shekel remained stable against the euro. The weakening of the dollar against the shekel was part of the global trend of the weakening of the dollar against most currencies. The Bank of Israel's forecasts relating to the current account and capital imports in 2008 are that thebasic pressures for the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar will ease, contrary to the trend prevailing in the last few years. The capital and money market: Since the previous interest rate decision (28/10) the Tel Aviv 25 share index has held steady, unlike the leading indices world wide that recorded drops of between 5 percent and 10 percent over the same period. At the same time the yield on 10-year unindexed Israel government bonds remained stable at around 5.5 percent, similar to its level in the previous month. The yields on 10-year US government bonds, on the other hand, continued to decline, so that the gap between yields on Israel government bonds and US government bonds widened to 1.63 percentage points from 1.3 percentage point in the previous month. After about three years when total credit to the business sector rose at rates similar to the growth rates of nominal business sector product, this year an accelerated rise in credit is evident, with most of the increase coming from non-bank sources. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread rose from 0.22 percent to 0.37 percent, in line with the rise in risk premiums in financial markets around the world. The world economy: The crisis in the financial markets that beganin July and eased a little in October worsened again last month, and significant price declines in financial markets resumed. This came in the wake of a series of announcements about declines in financial institutions' profits in the third quarter and pessimistic profit forecasts for the last quarter of the year. The prevailing assessment is that the credit crisis will have the effect of reducing the volume of credit, particularly in the US, thus increasing the risk regarding the level of economic activity andgrowth in the US and around the world. Forecasts published by the Federal Reserve last week also predicted a significant slowdown in growth. Most assessments at present are that the impact on world growth will be moderate. Risks of inflation around the world have risen recently, particularly because of increases in the prices of oil and food, but in light of the credit crisis central banks are not expected to raise interest rates, and the Fed iscurrently expected to reduce its interest rate at its December meeting. The main considerations behind the decision Based on expectations derived from the capital market, private forecasters' predictions, and the results of the Bank of Israel's models, it appears that the current month's level of interest is consistent with the achievement of the price-stability target over the next twelve months. With regardto the factors affecting inflation, the continuation of growth creates price pressures that are reflected in local prices. In addition, world prices of energy and food are rising. At the same time, the weakening of the dollar against the shekel tends to reduce inflation in Israel. Furthermore, the effects of the financial crisis on the global economy are likely to serve to moderate the inflation rate in Israel. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. 26.11.2007 The Bank of Israel interest rate for December 2007 remains unchanged at 4 percent. The Bank of Israel interest rate for December 2007 remains unchanged at 4 percent. The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for December 2007 will remain unchanged at 4 percent.

Malaysia,2007-11-26,"At its meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia 's Monetary Policy Committee decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. The Malaysian economy continued on a steady growth path and maintained healthy employment growth in the third quarter. This trend is expected to be maintained in the fourth quarter. The strength of domestic demand is expected to sustain growth going into 2008. However, greater uncertainties in the credit markets and weaker demand conditions in some of the large industrial economies have heightened the risk of slower global growth and its potential implications on the domestic economy. Inflation in Malaysia has edged upwards but its level has remained low. The price pressures being experienced by the global economy are expected to persist over the medium term, arising from higher food, fuel and commodity prices. These developments may increase the risk to the outlook for inflation. A number of mitigating factors, including capacity expansion, would however moderate the impact on domestic inflation in 2008. The Monetary Policy Committee views the risks to inflation and economic growth as being about balanced. The future thrust of monetary policy would depend on new information and our assessment of the change in the balance of risks to the medium term outlook for inflation and growth. The meeting also approved the schedule of Monetary Policy Committee meetings for 2008. The Monetary Policy Statement will continue to be released at 6:00 p.m. on the same day as the Monetary Policy Committee meeting. Schedule of Monetary Policy Committee Meetings for 2008.

Poland,2007-11-28,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 28 November 2007 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 27-28 November 2007 The Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point to the level: (cid:131) reference rate 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 6.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 5.25% on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of strong growth encompassing all its sectors. The data released since the last meeting of the Council confirm that economic growth in Poland is gradually decelerating, which is consistent with the results of the October projection. Economic growth in Poland should be supported by still strong, even though weakening, activity in the world economy. At the same time, there has been a increase in uncertainty about the scale of the impact of problems in the financial markets on growth of the US and euro-area economies. In October the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland was slightly higher than expected reaching 3.0%, thus exceeding the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. In the Council's assessment the months to come will see inflation running above the central path of the October projection. In the Council's assessment, in the coming quarters economic growth will most probably continue to exceed the growth of potential GDP. The latest information on labour market developments points to a stronger wage growth and a further deterioration in the relation between wage and labour productivity growth. A further build-up in wage pressure and, consequently, inflationary pressure is quite probable. The risk of inflation increase is also raised by the food price growth observed in the world economy and affecting the Polish market and also by prices of oil being higher than assumed in the projection. Moreover, the Budget Act conveyed to the Parliament points to a procyclical impact of fiscal policy on the economy next year. The mid-term increase in inflation may be curbed by the continuing very good financial results of enterprises and high investment growth conducive to productivity growth. The increase in inflation may also be constrained by low growth of external prices related to globalisation and the ensuing increased competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services. The inflationary pressure may also be reduced by a slowdown of the global economy. However, the Council assessed that the impact of those factors may be insufficient to keep inflation at the target level over the monetary policy transmission horizon. Considering the above factors and the risk of second-round effects of an increase in the current inflation, the Council assessed the probability of inflation overshooting the inflation target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running below the target and decided to raise the NBP's interest rates. The Council will strive to bring inflation down to the level consistent with the inflation target in the medium term. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa.

Nigeria,2007-12-04,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 53 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. DECEMBER 4, 2007 The Monetary Policy Committee of the CBN met on 4th December 2007 and decided to raise the MPR by 50 basis points from 90 percent to 95 per cent. 1) The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 4th December, 2007. The Committee reviewed the major macroeconomic developments and the implementation of fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies in 2007, as well as the challenges for the first quarter of 2008. The MPC noted both the global and domestic economic and financial developments and how they influenced macroeconomic environment in 2007. The Committee noted with satisfaction the sustained single digit inflation throughout the year and the orderly functioning of the foreign exchange and domestic financial markets. 2) It however, acknowledged the pressure of appreciation on the naira exchange rate which arose principally from the sustained high foreign exchange inflows buoyed by the favorable macroeconomic environment, investment climate as well as high rates of return in domestic financial markets. The Committee restated its commitment to ensuring continued price and monetary stability through an appropriate monetary policy stance for the rest of the year. Key Macroeconomic Developments 3) Inflation: The Committee noted with satisfaction the decline in year-on-year (headline) inflation from 64 per cent in June 2007 to 41 per cent in September, 2007. In October, however, the year- on- year inflation rose slightly to 46 percent reflecting increases in the prices of utilities, transport, hotel and tourism and education. Staff projections indicate that the year on- year headline inflation would move to 68 percent in November and further up to 73 per cent by year- end due mainly to year end demand pressures. This is expected to moderate in the first quarter of 2008. 4) Exchange Rate: The MPC noted the steady appreciation in the Naira exchange rate, particularly in the second half of 2007. The effective Naira exchange rate at the wDAS appreciated from N12743/US$1 in June to N12428/US$1 in September and further to N12063 /US$1 in November 2007. Relative to the end-December 2006, the Naira has thus far appreciated by about 70 per cent. The Committee noted the rising private foreign exchange inflows and the increased demand for the Naira as key factors which contributed to the Naira appreciation. 5) External Reserves: The Committee observed that the gross official reserve has increased to about US$50 billion in November, 2007. This represented an increase of 1806 per cent when compared with the level of US$4242 billion in the corresponding period of 2006. The level of reserves, the Committee noted, could support approximately 23 months of current foreign exchange disbursements. 6) Monetary Aggregates: Over the end- December, 2006 level, broad money (M2) grew by 213 and 2531 percent in September and October, 2007. When annualized the M2 grew by 2844 and 3025 percent, respectively in the two months, compared with 333 and 396 percent, respectively in the corresponding months of 2006. The growth of M2 was driven by the increase in foreign assets(net) of the banking system as well as the rapid rise in credit to the private sector since the end of the second quarter. Going by recent, both M2 and reserve money may be within targets for the year. 7) While the Committee expressed concern about the rapid growth of M2, it however, noted with relief that this did not translate to higher inflation during the year, partly on account of the sharp increase in non-oil output. 8) Credit: The Committee noted that credit to the private sector maintained an upward trend in most of 2007. Credit to the private sector as at end-October 2007 relative to the level at end-December 2006 grew by 722 per cent. Staff projections through end-December 2007 indicate that private sector credit would grow by 495 per cent over end-2006 level. 9) Interest Rates: The MPC observed that the volatility in the inter-bank short-term rates continued to ameliorate during the year, as rates fluctuated within the interest rate corridor up to October when it was reviewed. Although the average inter-bank rate trended slightly upwards thereafter, it has remained generally below the MPR. 10) Fiscal Stance: The Federal budget for 2008 has projected significant increases in expenditure on account of build-up of infrastructure, environmental protection and social safety nets. As these expenditures take time to yield results, there would in the interim period be an impact on aggregate demand. The private sector's own investments in partnership with those of the public sector would also have lagged effects on output. FUTURE OUTLOOK: The MPC noted that the overall macroeconomic picture in 2007 has reflected improved stability; just as the prospects for the first quarter 2008 appear good. The Bank's projections show that the year-on-year (headline) inflation could remain single-digit in the first quarter of 2008, provided CBN continues to take proactive steps to manage the liquidity surfeit. There remains a strong upside risk to inflation in the near-term due to expected large capital inflows and significant fiscal injections. DECISIONS In anticipation of the imminent fiscal surge and continuing capital inflows; and in order to drive core inflation down to single-digit as well as to sustain headline inflation along its present path, the Committee decided to take the following proactive actions: a) Issue new primary instruments to mop up a significant portion of the anticipated excess liquidity in the system. b) Continue with the regular open market operations (OMO) c) Raise the MPR from 90 percent to 95 percent - to signal a tightening of monetary policy stance. Thank you for your kind attention. Professor Chukwuma C Soludo CFR Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria. Abuja."
Thailand,2007-12-04,"No 60 /2007 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 4 December 2007 Ms. Duangmanee Vongpradhip. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. Domestic demand started to recover as recent economic indicators showed signs of continued improvement in both consumption and investment. At the same time, exports continued to expand well. While the problems in the US subprime market were likely to persist, their impact on the Thai economy had so far been limited. Nonetheless these problems should be monitored closely going forward. Inflation began to accelerate in line with rising world oil and commodity prices. In addition, the pass-through from costs to the prices of goods and services was likely to increase, going forward. The MPC assessed that the overall growth momentum had improved although risks to growth still remained, particularly from the global economy. The risks to inflation increased, compared to the previous meeting. However core inflation was expected to remain within the target range for the next 8 quarters. The MPC therefore decided to keep the 1-day repurchase rate at 325 per cent per annum."
Euroarea,2007-12-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The latest information has confirmed the existence of strong short-term upward pressure on inflation, with the HICP inflation rate reaching 3.0% in November. It has also fully confirmed our assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term. Against this background, and with money and credit growth remaining very vigorous in the euro area, the Governing Council stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by its mandate. However, the reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still evolving and is accompanied by continued uncertainty about the potential impact on the real economy. By acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment, we will ensure that second-round effects and risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Firmly anchoring medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability is all the more important at times of financial market volatility and increased uncertainty. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the coming weeks. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. According to Eurostat's first estimate, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of euro area real GDP in the third quarter of 2007 was 0.7%, in line with the earlier flash estimate. Domestic demand remained the main driver of economic growth in the third quarter, confirming the sustained nature of economic expansion in the euro area. The latest information on economic activity from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates supports the assessment that economic growth has continued into the fourth quarter of this year, though probably at a more moderate pace than in the third quarter. Profitability has been sustained, employment growth has been robust and the unemployment rate has fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. These factors are also reflected in the December 2007 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. Annual real GDP growth is projected to lie in the range of 2.4% to 2.8% in 2007, and be between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2008, and between 1.6% and 2.6% in 2009. In comparison with the September ECB staff projections, the range projected for real GDP growth in 2008 has been revised slightly downwards, whereas for 2007 the new range lies within the upper part of the previous one. Available forecasts from international organisations broadly confirm this outlook. The scenario of sustained real GDP growth broadly in line with trend potential is based on the expectation that the global economy will remain resilient, with the slowdown of economic growth in the United States partly offset by the continued strength of emerging market economies. External demand should therefore provide ongoing support to euro area exports and investment. Consumption growth should also contribute to economic expansion, in line with developments in real disposable income, as continued employment growth provides supportive conditions. That said, in view of the potential impact of ongoing financial market volatility and re-pricing of risk on the real economy, the level of uncertainty remains high. In the Governing Council's view, the risks surrounding this outlook for economic growth lie on the downside. They relate mainly to the potential for a broader impact from the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on financing conditions and confidence and on world and euro area growth, possible further oil and commodity price rises, as well as concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, the annual HICP inflation rate increased sharply again in November 2007, to 3.0% from 2.6% in October. Oil prices have risen strongly in recent months, and food prices have increased substantially, reflecting higher global demand. In addition, as emphasised on previous occasions, we are currently in the midst of a period in which unfavourable effects from energy prices are having a strong upward impact on annual HICP inflation rates, owing to the marked decline in oil prices a year ago. Looking ahead, the HICP inflation rate is expected to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months, and is likely to moderate only gradually in the course of 2008. Hence, the period of temporarily high rates of inflation would be somewhat more protracted than previously expected. The December Eurosystem staff projections foresee annual HICP inflation to be between 2.0% and 2.2% in 2007, but then to rise to between 2.0% and 3.0% in 2008. For 2009. HICP inflation is projected to lie between 1.2% and 2.4%. Compared with the September 2007 ECB staff projections, the projected ranges for HICP inflation in 2007 and 2008 have shifted upwards. Forecasts from international organisations which incorporate recent inflation developments give a broadly similar picture. These projections largely mirror the assumed path of oil and food prices, for which available futures prices suggest a deceleration in the course of next year. On the domestic side, unit labour cost growth is projected to increase over the projection horizon. In this context it is important to emphasise that the staff projections assume that recent oil and food price dynamics and their impact on HICP inflation will not have broadly-based second-round effects on wage-setting behaviour. A further key assumption is that growth in profit margins will moderate over the projection horizon. In combination, these two assumptions imply, in the context of the staff projections, a continuation of overall contained domestic cost pressures, which contributes to the moderation in inflation projected in 2009. In the Governing Council's view, risks to this medium-term outlook for price developments are fully confirmed to lie on the upside. These risks include the possibility of further rises in oil and agricultural prices , continuing the strong momentum observed in recent months, as well as increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far. Moreover, taking into account the existence of capacity constraints, the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive developments in labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge. Furthermore, an increase in pricing power in market segments with low competition could materialise. It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on wage and price-setting stemming from recent commodity price rises be avoided. To that end, any explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices should be eliminated. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Money and credit have both continued to grow vigorously in recent months. The annual growth rate of M3 in October, at 12.3%, is likely to have been influenced by a number of temporary factors, such as the flattening of the yield curve, the financial market turmoil and specific transactions associated with the restructuring of certain banking groups. However, even taking these special factors into account, the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong. Moreover, the sustained expansion of loans to the domestic private sector, which grew at an annual rate of 11.2% in October, points to the continued vigour of underlying monetary dynamics. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, both to detect underlying trends associated with inflationary pressures at longer horizons and to better understand shorter-term dynamics. Such monitoring will also provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets. A broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important at present given recent financial market developments. Heightened financial volatility may influence the short-term behaviour of money-holders and thereby complicate the extraction of the underlying trend monetary developments. At the same time, monetary and credit data can also offer an important insight into how financial institutions, households and firms have responded to the financial market turmoil. For the time being, however, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early August has strongly influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates, although specific balance sheet items, such as holdings of money market fund shares/units, may have been affected. Indeed, the growth of bank loans to households and non-financial corporations has remained robust in recent months, which may suggest that the supply of credit has not been impaired. Further data and analysis will be required to develop a more complete view of the impact of the financial market developments on bank balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis fully confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of vigorous money and credit growth and against the background of sound economic fundamentals in the euro area. At the same time, the reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still evolving and uncertainty about the potential impact on the real economy has continued. Consequently, the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments. Our monetary policy stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability, as required by our mandate. In particular, for the recent increase in inflation to remain temporary, it is of the essence that no second-round effects materialise via an impact from current inflation rates on wage and price-setting behaviour. By acting in a firm and timely manner on the basis of our assessment, we will ensure that second-round effects and risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the coming weeks. Turning to fiscal policy, the European Commission's autumn 2007 economic forecast generally confirms the picture of improving budget balances in the euro area this year. However, progress with structural fiscal consolidation in countries with remaining budget imbalances is generally disappointing. This lack of ambition unnecessarily prolongs the correction of remaining fiscal deficits and could lead to negative surprises should the macroeconomic environment turn less favourable. In this context. Member States should meet the commitment they made in the Eurogroup's Berlin agreement of April 2007, namely that most euro area members would achieve their medium-term objectives in 2008 or 2009, and all should aim for 2010 at the latest. With regard to structural reforms, it is important that governments continue their efforts to make progress. The improvements in the employment situation over recent years show the fruits of past reforms. It is essential that the reform momentum to enhance competition, productivity growth and labour market flexibility is maintained and that there are no reversals of the reform process in the countries of the euro area."
South Africa,2007-12-06,"The short-term inflation outlook has deteriorated since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. Food and energy prices have maintained pressure on inflation and these pressures are expected to persist in the coming months. At the same time, previous monetary policy actions are probably beginning to have an impact on household consumption expenditure and this is expected to help moderate inflation pressures over time. The MPC however has to ensure that the short term impact of higher inflation does not allow inflation expectations to become entrenched at higher levels. CPIX inflation remained outside the target range for the seventh consecutive month, reaching a 4-and-a-half-year high of 7,3 per cent in October 2007. Food price inflation has continued to accelerate, measuring 12,4 per cent in October. Most of the food categories in CPIX recorded double-digit rates of increase, with the main contributions emanating from grain products, milk, cheese and eggs, and vegetables. Meat price inflation, however, declined to 6,6 per cent. Petrol prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 12,0 per cent in October following moderate increases in the previous three months. Administered prices excluding petrol continued their upward trend and measured 8,5 per cent in October. There is however some evidence that upward pressure on other components of inflation may be moderating. If food and petrol were excluded. CPIX inflation would have measured 4,8 per cent in October, compared to 5,0 per cent in July and August 2007. Low or negative rates of inflation are still being recorded in the following categories: clothing and footwear, furniture, recreation and communication. Production price inflation in October 2007 remained high at 9,5 per cent, which was marginally above that in the previous two months. Imported goods inflation declined to 7,5 per cent while the prices of domestically produced goods increased by 10,2 per cent. Prices of agricultural and manufactured foods increased by 26,1 per cent and 17,5 per cent respectively which suggests that further pressures on retail food prices can be expected in the coming months. The most recent central forecast of the Bank indicates a further deterioration in the inflation outlook, particularly in the short term, when compared to the previous forecast. CPIX inflation is now expected to peak at around 7,8 per cent in the first quarter of next year. Thereafter CPIX inflation is expected to decline to below the upper end of the target range by the final quarter of 2008. A gradual downward trend is expected to persist and to measure 5,2 per cent in the final quarter of 2009. The higher trend is a result of higher administered price assumptions, particularly for petrol and electricity over the forecast period. Despite the higher short-term trend in inflation, expectations remain contained within the inflation target range. According to the inflation expectations survey that is conducted on behalf of the Bank by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at the University of Stellenbosch, there was only a slight deterioration in expectations in the fourth quarter compared to those in the third quarter when a significant increase in expectations was recorded. CPIX inflation in 2008 is now expected to average 5,9 per cent, compared to the 5,8 per cent expected in the previous survey. Significantly. CPIX inflation expectations for 2009 remained unchanged at 5,6 per cent. Expectations as reflected in the break-even inflation rates, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds, reflect some deterioration. Break-even inflation rates over different maturities decreased between the August and October meetings of the MPC. Since the October meeting, break-even inflation has increased somewhat over all maturities, but still remains below the 6 per cent level. The main risks to the inflation outlook emanate from food, petrol and electricity price prospects. International oil prices have continued to remain an upside risk factor. At the time of the October meeting of the MPC. North Sea Brent crude oil prices were trading at around US$78 per barrel. Since then prices increased to peak at almost US$100 per barrel, although in recent days prices have fallen declined to around US$90 per barrel. Domestic petrol prices have been adversely affected by these international trends, and the local price of 93 octane petrol increased by 3 cents per litre in November and by 43 cents per litre in December. The degree of upside risk from food price increases may have subsided over time, but food prices nevertheless remain the main contributors to inflation. As noted, production prices indicate that further pressures can be expected on CPIX in the short term. However there are expectations of some moderation during the course of next year as a result of base effects and more favourable weather conditions and higher crop estimates. Futures prices generally reflect an expectation of lower prices, particularly for maize, during 2008. Global food price pressures are nevertheless expected to persist for some time. Electricity prices in particular pose a significant risk to the inflation outlook. The National Electricity Regulator is due to make a decision on the application by Eskom to raise electricity tariffs by 18 per cent in 2008 and 17 per cent in 2009 in order to help finance its capital expenditure programme. Despite these risks and pressures, not all of the recent developments have been negative from an inflation perspective. In particular, there is evidence of a lagged response by the economy to the previous monetary policy tightening. Household consumption expenditure continues to show some signs of moderation in response to the changed monetary policy stance and lower household disposable income growth. Final consumption expenditure by households grew by 4,5 per cent in the third quarter of 2007, compared to a revised 4,9 per cent growth in the second quarter. This third quarter moderation was a result of a marked deceleration in real expenditure on semi-durable goods in particular. The real value of retail sales remained broadly unchanged from the second quarter to the third quarter. Sales of new vehicles also remained subdued. Despite these developments, the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index reflected an increase in consumer confidence during the fourth quarter. Reflecting the slowdown in household consumption expenditure, credit extension to the private sector has shown some signs of moderation, but nevertheless remains at high levels. Twelve-month growth in total loans and advances had declined gradually over the past few months. Growth over twelve months in loans and advances extended to the household sector declined to 20,1 per cent in October 2007, having peaked at 28,2 per cent in February 2006. The growth rate of loans and advances to the corporate sector declined to 29,7 per cent in October. Household debt as a percentage of household disposable income increased to 77,4 per cent in the third quarter. Asset price growth, which in the past has helped to underpin domestic demand, appears to be somewhat restrained. Having recovered from the initial impact of the sub-prime developments in the US and euro area, the JSE limited has been fairly volatile, in line with the uncertainties that prevailed in the global equity markets. In addition, according to ABSA Bank, the year-on-year rate of increase in house prices in the middle segment has declined further to 13,6 per cent in October. Fiscal policy continues to be supportive of monetary policy. In the October Medium Term Budget Policy Statement, the commitment to fiscal prudence was confirmed with the projection of fiscal surpluses for the coming three years. Output growth remained strong, with GDP growth measuring 4,7 per cent in the third quarter of 2007 compared to a revised 4,4 per cent in the second quarter. Economic growth therefore continues to be around rates consistent with the potential growth rate of the economy. Growth in gross fixed capital formation remained strong in the third quarter, and this is expected to underpin growth going forward. The exchange rate of the rand has displayed a higher degree of volatility in recent weeks, but nevertheless has remained relatively unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC. The relative strength of the rand has been underpinned by sustained capital inflows which financed an expanding current account deficit in the third quarter of 2007. The deficit, which measured approximately 8,1 per cent of GDP, was driven mainly by increased imports of manufactured goods, as well as by a marked acceleration in service payments to non-residents. Despite this, capital inflows were sufficient to allow for a further accumulation of foreign exchange reserves by the Bank. At the end of November, the official gross gold and other foreign exchange reserves had increased to US$32,3 billion, and the international liquidity position to US$30,7 billion. The outlook for the international economy remains uncertain, with continued turbulence in international financial markets. The reported losses of institutions with exposure to the US sub-prime mortgage market have exceeded expectations, and there are concerns that the downturn in some of the advanced economies may be more severe than originally anticipated. Global inflation appears to be contained although oil and food prices continue to pose a risk to the outlook. The assessment of the MPC is that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook continues to be on the upside. Therefore the MPC has decided to adjust the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 11,0 per cent per annum with effect from Friday, 7 December 2007. The MPC will continue to monitor relevant developments and take the necessary steps to ensure that inflation returns to within the target range.

South Korea,2007-12-07,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. The domestic economy seems likely to maintain its upward trend. While investment exhibits a slowdown in its pace of expansion, exports continue to post robust growth and private consumption shows a steady increase. There is, however, a high degree of uncertainty surrounding future economic developments, largely due to the run-up in international oil prices and the prolonged international financial market unrest. Consumer price inflation has picked up its pace, mainly influenced by high oil prices. The upward trend of real estate prices has flattened out. In the financial markets, there is ample liquidity and financial institutions' lending continues to show a steady increase. Meanwhile, financial market price variables have shown increased volatility, mainly affected by the international financial market unrest."
United States,2007-12-11,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4-1/4 percent. Incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing, reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending. Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks. Today's action, combined with the policy actions taken earlier, should help promote moderate growth over time. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but elevated energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put upward pressure on inflation. In this context, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Recent developments, including the deterioration in financial market conditions, have increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Charles L Evans; Thomas M Hoenig; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Frederic S Mishkin; William Poole; and Kevin M Warsh. Voting against was Eric S Rosengren, who preferred to lower the target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at this meeting. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 4-3/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York. Philadelphia. Cleveland. Richmond. Atlanta. Chicago, and St. Louis."
Chile,2007-12-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 December 2007 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 6% (annual). This decision is necessary to reduce the propagation risks of current high inflation to costs and expectations, in order to insure that annual inflation will converge to 3% over the policy horizon. Internationally, problems and risks associated with the subprime crisis have intensified, and reduced dynamism is forecast for industrialized economies. Meanwhile, the oil price, although still high, fell with respect to its high levels a month ago, while the prices of copper and several food products continue to be high, above projections. This shapes an external scenario relevant to the Chilean economy that, although still positive, presents higher risks of adverse conditions. In the domestic scene, available information points at output growth in the second half falling short of projections in the latest Monetary Policy Report, a situation that goes beyond the performance of some specific sectors. However, on the demand side, both consumption and investment remain dynamic. Salaried employment continues to grow, albeit at lower rates, and internal financial conditions show no significant changes. Annual CPI inflation continued to increase and now stands above 7%. Annual figures are projected to remain high for several months, to later descend toward the target. In the last month, the CPI was affected particularly by sudden, large price increases in electric power and fuels, widening the gap with CPIX1 inflation (which excludes fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities). The price increases of some foods, particularly perishables, have begun to revert. Medium- and long-term inflation expectations remain anchored around 3% per annum. The Board considers it opportune to state that the future path of the monetary policy rate will depend on incoming information and its consequences on the inflation forecast. Particularly important for this will be the unfolding of the international scenario, the evolution of the output gap and the potential propagation of recent inflationary shocks to other prices. * The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2007-12-13,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release December 13, 2007 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 875 percent per annu. In its meeting held on December 13, 2007, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and lending rates at 875 percent and 1075 percent, respectivel. The annual headline CPI inflation declined to 75 percent (y/y) in October and to 68 percent in Novembe. The drop in headline CPI was particularly intensified as base effects caused by last year's supply shocks continue to level of. However the inflationary demand pressures from higher economic growth still pose risks to the inflation outlook, in addition to the possible propagation of the higher food prices on non-food price. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation and the recent developments in international financial markets, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Turkiye,2007-12-13,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate from 16.25 to 15.75 percent, and lending rate from 20.75 to 20 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. from 12.25 to 11.75 percent, lending rate from 23.75 to 23 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions from 19.75 to 19 percent. Third quarter GDP figures suggest a mainly supply-driven slowdown in economic activity. Private domestic demand displays a moderate recovery, yet the slowdown in government expenditures and in external demand contains domestic demand, as anticipated. Therefore, aggregate demand conditions continue to support disinflation. Accordingly, inflation is expected to decelerate despite the risks from food and energy prices. The Committee, judging the recent rise in inflation as temporary, maintained the policy stance presented in the October Inflation Report, and assessed that, under a measured and cautious rate cut cycle, the risks against attaining the inflation target in the medium run are balanced. Drought and energy related supply shocks not only increase inflation temporarily but also have short term adverse effects on the growth rate. The Committee underlined that the primary goal of the Central Bank is to achieve price stability, and noted that monetary policy remains restrictive even after the recent rate cuts. The timing and extent of further easing will depend on incoming information regarding global liquidity conditions, external demand, fiscal policy implementation and other factors affecting the medium term inflation outlook. Furthermore, potential second round effects of rising food and energy prices are closely monitored. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook will lead the Committee to reconsider its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Peru,2007-12-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR DECEMBER 2007 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 5.0% The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 5.0 percent The Board continues to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, distinguishing the factors with temporary impacts from those with permanent effects. Likewise, the Central Bank continues to keep a close watch on international economy developments and on their repercussions on inflation in the country. Inflation's recent increase above the target is basically associated with rises in the international prices of some basic food inputs. However, inflation in November has decreased to 0.11 percent, a rate compatible with the inflation target. Should expectations about inflation increase or should domestic demand grow at a faster pace than productive capacity and productivity, the Bank will make any necessary preventive adjustments in the reference interest rate. The Board made this decision considering the following macroeconomic information: The Consumer Price Index for Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.11 percent in November the second lowest rate this year and accumulated 3.5 percent over the last 12 months, a level above the monetary target range (2 percent, plus or minus one percentage point). The rise in the prices of papaya, evaporated milk, and citrus fruits observed during the month were partially offset by a drop in the prices of poultry, onion, and sugar. Core inflation was 0.59 percent and accumulated 2.9 percent over the last twelve months. On the other hand, imported inflation was 0.5 percent in November and showed a last 12-month rate of 10.0 percent. As pointed out in our Inflation Report of September, last 12-month inflation is expected to be transitorily above the upper band of the target range (3.0 percent) in the short-term, due mainly to a higher imported inflation rate, particularly in terms of inputs used for the production of food products. Inflation is expected to converge to the target (2.0 percent), as in other similar episodes. Firms' expectations on inflation for 2008 and 2009 remain around 2.0 percent. On the other hand, inflation expectations in the case of financial entities and economic analysts have been revised slightly upwards, but remain within the inflation target range. Thus, according to the surveys carried out with financial entities and economic analysts, inflation expectations for 2008 and 2009 are 2.8 and 2.5 percent respectively in the case of the former and 2.5 and 2.4 respectively in the case of the latter. Economic activity continues to show a robust growth: GDP grew 8.2 percent and domestic demand grew 11.2 percent during the first nine months of this year. The nuevo sol appreciated 0.63 percent against the dollar in November and 6.4 year-to-date. Moreover, the nuevo sol depreciated 0.15 percent against the currency basket of our trading partners in November, and has appreciated 1.6 percent so far this year. The average monthly interest rate for the interbank market was 4.99 percent in November, close to the reference interest rate. During the session, the Board approved the annual interest rates on the following active and passive operations in soles between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.75 percent. Overnight deposits: 4.25 percent. Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the interest rates on the following operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage point. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.75 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to remuneration: 3.5 percent. In 2008, the Board will approve the Monetary Program for each month according to the following schedule: January 10 February 7 March 13 April 10 May 8 June 12 July 10 August 7 September 11 October 9 November 13 December 11 2."
Philippines,2007-12-19,"The Monetary Board today decided to reduce by 25 basis points the BSP's key policy interest rates to 5.25 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 7.25 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts were also reduced accordingly. This is the third time in as many policy meetings that a reduction in policy rates was adopted. In deciding to cut policy rates, the Monetary Board noted that the inflation outlook continues to provide scope for further monetary policy easing. Inflation remains likely to fall well below the 4.0-5.0 percent target range in 2007 and within the 4.0 percent + 1 percentage point target in 2008. Demand indicators have been consistent with modest demand growth, and these have exerted limited price pressures; inflation expectations remain well anchored; and liquidity growth has been decelerating for the last six months up to October, reflecting the impact of the monetary measures implemented by the BSP in May.Risks to the inflation outlook consist mainly of oil and food price pressures stemming from world markets. These risks remain manageable. While the firm peso has tempered the impact of higher import costs, developments in global oil and non-oil commodity prices bear close monitoring because of possible spill-over effects on domestic prices. The Monetary Board remains firmly committed to an environment of stable prices while being mindful of the liquidity requirements of a rapidly expanding economy."
Poland,2007-12-19,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 19 December 2007 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 18-19 December 2007 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 6.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 5.25% on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of strong growth encompassing all its sectors. In 2007 Q3 the economic growth was higher than expected in the October projection. It may, however, be expected that GDP growth in 2008 will be probably lower than in 2007. Economic growth in Poland should be supported by still strong, even though weakening, activity in the world economy. Yet, uncertainty about the scale of the impact of problems in the financial markets on growth of the US and euro-area economies persists. In November the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland was slightly higher than expected reaching 3.6%, thus remaining above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5% and breaching the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. As in many other countries considerable increase in inflation has been largely driven by a strong growth in food and fuel prices. The Council maintains its assessment that the months to come will see inflation exceeding the level expected in the October projection. In the Council's assessment, in the coming quarters economic growth will most probably continue to exceed the growth of potential GDP. The latest information on labour market developments points to a continuing strong wage growth and unfavourable relation between wage and labour productivity growth. A further build-up in wage pressure and, consequently, inflationary pressure is quite probable. The risk of continuing high inflation is also raised by the food price growth observed in the world economy and affecting the Polish market and also by prices of oil being higher than assumed in the projection. Moreover, the Budget Act conveyed to the Parliament points to a procyclical impact of fiscal policy on the economy next year. Amendments introduced to the Budget Act during parliamentary works do not change this assessment. In the mid-term inflation may be curbed by the continuing very good financial results of enterprises and high investment growth conducive to productivity growth. Inflation may also be constrained by globalisation and the ensuing increased competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services as well as to the relative stability of the zloty exchange rate. The inflationary pressure may also be reduced by a slowdown of the global economy. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. The Council assessed the probability of inflation overshooting the inflation target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running below the target. A more comprehensive assessment of the inflation outlook will be possible after analysing the data released in the near future. The Council will strive to bring inflation down to the level consistent with the inflation target in the medium term. The Council will be closely monitoring the growth and structure of domestic demand, including the degree of the expansionary fiscal policy stance, the relation between wage and labour productivity growth, zloty exchange rate, developments of the current account balance and the impact of globalisation on the economy and on food prices. The Council has adopted The Financial Plan of the National Bank of Poland for 2008."
Israel,2007-12-24,"24.12.2007 The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for January 2008 by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for January 2008 will rise by 25 basis points, to 4.25 percent. This is consistent with the policy of maintaining price stability, as expressed by the inflation targetof 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose in November by 0.4 percent, exceeding the forecasts that ranged between a reduction of 0.3 percent and a rise of 0.1 percent. In the last twelve months the CPI hasrisen by 2.8 percent. Inflation forecasts: Israeli forecasters expect, on average, thatthe 2007 inflation rate will reach 3.2 percent, and that inflation over the next 12 months will be 2.7 percent. They also expect, on average, that the Bank of Israel's interest rate will rise by 0.75 percentage points by the end of 2008. Expectations of inflation over the next 12 months, asderived from the capital markets, have risen from 1.2 percent in the two months prior to the previous interest rate decision (on 26 November 2007) to 1.9 percent following the publication of the November CPI. Derived expectations of the Bank of Israel interest rate are that it will rise a little in the next quarter. According to the econometric model of the Research Department, an increase in the interest rate will be needed to keep the inflation rate within the target range in the next 12 months. According to the Monetary Department's model, inflation will remain within the target range without a change in the interest rate. In both cases the assumption is that the exchange rate remains at the present level. Real economic activity: The composite state-of-the-economy index for November rose by 0.6 percent, a sign of the continued growth of economic activity. Furthermore, the indices for September and October were revisedupwards. Private consumption increased steeply in the third quarter, exports rose at a faster pace, investment in fixed capital rose, and the rise inimports slowed. It is possible that the implications of the financial crisis will reduce the rate of economic activity in 2008. The labor market and wages: The manpower survey for the third quarter of 2007 shows that unemployment fell from 7.5 percent in the second quarter to 7.3 percent in the third. The number of employees in the business sector and public sector increased in the third quarter by 5.9 percent and 2.6 percent respectively compared to the third quarter of 2006. Continuing the trend that started in the last quarter of 2006, real labor productivityrose by 1.4 percent in the third quarter, and labor costs per hour increased by 2.8 percent compared to the second quarter. Budget policy: The government's budget surplus since the beginning of the year reached NIS 7.7 billion, and it appears that thebudget will end the year close to balance. At a time when global economic developments and their effect on Israel's economy are unclear in light of the credit crisis, it is important to continue to adhere strictly tothe budget framework that played a major role in sustaining economic growth over the last few years. This is necessary in order to increase the chances of sustaining the growth trend in 2008. Hence it is important that the proposed budget for 2008, which has been approved by the government and has passed its first reading in the Knesset, be passed in accordance with the budget guidelines. The forex market: The period between the previous interest rate decision on November 26 and December 23 started with the weakening of the shekel against the dollar, and ended with its strengthening. Over the whole of the period the shekel weakened against the dollar by 1.4 percent, and washighly volatile. During that period the shekel strengthened against the euro by 1.8 percent. The strengthening of the dollar against the shekel was in line with its strengthening against most currencies. It appears that in the current account and capital imports in 2008 the basic pressures for the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar will ease somewhat. The capital and money markets: Since the previous interest rate decision (on November 26) till December 23, the leading Tel Aviv Stock Exchange indices rose by approximately 4 percent, as did the leading stock exchanges world wide. At the same time the yield on 10-year unindexed Israel government bonds rose by 0.6 percentage points, mostly after the publication of the November CPI. The yields on 10-year US government bonds also rose, by 0.2 percentage points. Thus the gap between yields on unindexed Israel government bonds and comparable US government bonds widened from 1.7 percentage points prior to the previous interest rate decision to 2.1 percentage points currently. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-yearCDS spread rose to 0.32 percent from 0.27 percent prior to the previous interest rate decision, while risk premiums in financial markets around the world rose. The world economy: Following a certain measure of calm in September and October, the effects of the credit crisis in the financial markets of the United States and Europe reappeared last month. Financing difficulties remained severe, and continued to constitute an obstacle to full market recovery. As part of the global effort to improve interbank liquidity, the major central banks continued to inject liquidity into the financial markets. Growth in the leading markets is expected to be slower than previously estimated, but global growth is expected to remain relatively strong, thanks mainly to the anticipated high rate of growth in the emerging markets. Inflation in the leading economies is higher than expected, against the background of the rise in world oil and food prices. Against this backdrop, the Fed is expected to continue reducing its interest rate, while the ECB and theBank of Japan are expected to leave their interest rates unchanged. The main considerations behind the decision The rise in the interest rate is necessary to try to meet the inflation target, in light of the rise in inflationary pressures reflected both in actual inflationand in inflation expectations. These pressures arise from several sources:a. continued rapid economic growth and the closing of the output gap; b. the risein import prices, reflecting among other things the worldwide rise in foodand energy prices. These pressures may cause inflation to exceed the upper limit of the target range in the next few months. The rise in the interest rate is intended to act to return inflation to within the target range. Continued rapid growth, and the efficient operation of Israel's financial markets (despite the global credit crisis), enable the Bank of Israel to focus on attempting to achieve the inflation target. This, in spite of the expectation that other central banks will continue with their expansionary policies. The Bank ofIsrael will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. for your information: The minutesof the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on 7 January 2008.
