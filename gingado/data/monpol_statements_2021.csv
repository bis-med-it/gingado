Pakistan,2021-01-02,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement January 2, 2021. At its meeting on 2 January 2021, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the policy rate at percent. The MPC noted that since the last meeting in November, the domestic recovery has gained some further traction. Most economic activity data and indicators of consumer and business sentiment have shown continued improvement. As result, there are upside risks to the current growth projection of slightly above percent in FY21. On the inflation front, recent out-turns are also encouraging, suggesting waning of supply-side price pressures from food and still-benign core inflation. While utility tariff increases may cause an uptick in inflation, this is likely to be transient given excess capacity in the economy and well- anchored inflation expectations. As result, inflation is still expected to fall within the previously announced range of 7-9 percent for FY21 and trend toward the 5-7 percent target range over the medium-term. With the inflation outlook relatively benign aside from the possibility of temporary supply-side shocks, the MPC felt that the existing accommodative stance of monetary policy remained appropriate to support the nascent recovery while keeping inflation expectations well-anchored and maintaining financial stability. While noting these favorable growth and inflation developments, the MPC also stressed that considerable uncertainty remains around the outlook. The trajectory of the Covid pandemic is difficult to predict, given still-elevated global cases, the emergence of new strains, and lingering uncertainties about the roll-out of vaccines worldwide. Such external shocks could slow the recovery. In light of such Covid-related uncertainties, the MPC considered it appropriate to provide some forward guidance on monetary policy to facilitate policy predictability and decision-making by economic agents. In the absence of unforeseen developments, the MPC expects monetary policy settings to remain unchanged in the near term. As the recovery becomes more durable and the economy returns to full capacity, the MPC expects any adjustments in the policy rate to be measured and gradual to achieve mildly positive real interest rates. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Real sector. The economic recovery underway since July has strengthened in recent months. Large-scale anufacturing (LSM) grew by. percent (y/y) in October and 14. percent (y/y) in November. The manufacturing recovery is also becoming more broad-based, with 12 out of 15 subsectors registering positive growth in November and employment beginning to recover. So far this fiscal year. LSM has grown by. percent (y/y), against contraction of. percent during the same period last year. Nevertheless the level of manufacturing activity generally remained below average levels in FY19, pointing to continued spare capacity in the economy. On the demand side, cement sales remain strong on the back of rising construction activity. POL sales are at two-year highs, and automobile sales are also rising in both urban (motorcars) and rural (tractors) markets. In agriculture, cotton output is likely to decline more than expected based on latest production estimates. However this is likely to be offset by improved growth in other major crops and higher wheat production due to the rise in support prices along with announced subsidies on fertilizers and pesticides for Rabi crops. While social distancing is still affecting some service sectors, wholesale, retail trade and transportation are expected to benefit from improvements in construction and manufacturing activity. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN External sector. Following five consecutive months of surpluses, the current account registered deficit of $662 million in December. While remittances and exports continued to grow steadily, the trade deficit rose due to rise in imports of machinery and industrial raw material, in line with the pick-up in economic activity. At the same time, wheat and sugar imports also rose to close demand and supply gaps in the domestic market. Nevertheless the current account remained in surplus during the first half of FY21, at $1. billion compared to deficit of over $2 billion during the same period last year. This improvement has been mainly driven by workers' remittances, which have remained above $2 billion every month during the current fiscal year due in part to travel restrictions and supportive policy measures taken by the government and SBP that have increased the use of formal channels. Further the pick-up in workers proceeding abroad in December bodes well for future prospects. Encouragingly exports have also recovered to their pre-COVID monthly level of around $2 billion since September, with broad-based recovery in export volumes recorded in almost all categories in December. Persistent improvement in the current account position and improving sentiment led to mild appreciation in the PKR since the last MPC meeting and further strengthened external buffers. SBP's foreign exchange reserves have risen to $13 billion, their highest level since December 2017. Based upon the data available so far, the outlook for the external sector has improved further and the current account deficit for FY21 is now projected to remain below percent of GDP. Fiscal sector. Fiscal developments have been largely in line with this year's budget and the government has continued to adhere to its commitment of no fresh borrowing from the SBP. Despite higher interest payments and Covid-related spending, healthy growth in revenues has contained the fiscal deficit during the fiscal year so far. Provisional estimates suggest that net FBR revenue grew by. and. percent (y/y) in November and December, respectively. Driven by rebound in direct taxes and the sales tax. FBR revenue during H1-FY21 has grown by percent (y/y) to come in close to the targeted level. Despite higher non-interest current expenditures, the primary balance posted surplus of. percent of GDP during July-November,. percentage points better than the same period last year. Monetary and inflation outlook. The MPC noted that financial conditions remain appropriately accommodative at this early stage of the recovery, with the real policy rate in slightly negative territory on forward-looking basis. Private sector credit has seen an encouraging uptick since the last MPC meeting, driven by continued rise in consumer and fixed investment loans on the back of SBP's refinance facilities. As demand recovers and inventories fall in some sectors, working capital loans have also picked up for the first time since the onset of the Covid pandemic, although their level remains lower than last year. Inflation pressures have eased since the last MPC, despite an upward adjustment in fuel prices. After remaining close to percent in the preceding two months, headline inflation fell to. percent in November and further to percent in December, the lowest rate since June 2019. This decline is mainly attributable to easing food inflation. Owing to conducive weather and various measures taken by the government to address supply-side issues, the price of perishables, wheat, pulses and rice has declined. Moreover core inflation has Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN continued to remain relatively soft since the beginning of FY21, in line with the presence of spare capacity in the economy. Inflation expectations of both businesses and consumers remain well-anchored and have declined in recent months. As result, at this stage of the recovery, any further supply-side shocks from food or utility tariffs are unlikely to have lasting inflationary impact through second-round effects. Page."
Israel,2021-01-04,"There was a recovery of economic activity in November and December following the exit from the second lockdown, but the variance of the adverse effect between the various industries continues, and the increase in morbidity led the government to announce a third lockdown. As of now, the restrictions are lighter than those imposed in the previous lockdowns. The direct weekly cost of the third lockdown in its current format, compared with a state of full economic activity, is estimated at about NIS 2.5 billion. The broad unemployment rate, which reached about 23 percent during the second lockdown, declined to about 12.7 percent in the first half of December, but is expected to again increase in view of the third lockdown. The impact on employmentis greater in industries that are characterized by low wages. The Research Department's forecast outlines two potential scenarios that are influenced by the pace of inoculation of the population. In the rapidinoculation scenario. GDP is expected to grow by 6.3 percent in 2021, and by 5.8 percent in 2022. In the slow inoculation scenario, growth is expected to be 3.5 percent in 2021 and 6 percent in 2022.<span style 3Dtext-align:justify;text-indent:-18 pt> In view of the fast pace of inoculations so far, it seems that the rapid inoculation scenario is more likely to come about than the slow inoculation scenario. The inflation environment remained low. The CPI for November declined by 0.2 percent, and inflation in the past 12 months is -0.6 percent (-0.2 percent net of energy, fruits and vegetables). One-year inflation expectations from the various sources remained below the lower bound of the target range. Forward expectations from the second year onward are within the target range. Since the previousinterest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 1.5 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate, by 2.8 percent against the US dollar, and by 0.6 percent against the euro.<span style 3Dtext-align:justify;text-indent:-18 pt> So far, it seems that exports are growing despite the appreciation, but at some point, the exchange rate may have a nonlinear effect on exports, and continued appreciation is expected to leadto a further slowing of inflation. The credit market continues to function with stable and low interest rates, supported by a variety of measures taken by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance. Bank credit to the business sector increased in recent months, and the increase in housing credit also continued. However, according to the Business Tendency Survey, the difficulty in raising credit remains higher than it was prior to the crisis, mainly among small businesses. The global economyis recovering, but there is continued uncertainty in view of the start of inoculation campaigns while morbidity continues to spread. A high level of variance is expected in the growth of various economies in 2021, and some countries are not expected to completely recover from the crisis even in 2022, mainly if there are further outbreaksof the virus and the pace of inoculations is slow. The monetary policies of the major central banks remains very accommodative. Thefast pace of the inoculation process in Israel increases the optimism regarding a rapid return of the economy to a path of growth in the coming year. However, the risks to economic activity remain high, and the adverse impact on the economy, and particularly on the labor market, is expected to be prolonged. The Committee will therefore continue to utilize a range of tools in order to increase the extent of the monetary policy accommodation and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. The Committee will expand the use of the existing tools, includingthe interest rate tool, and will operate additional ones, to the extent that it assesses that it is necessary in order to achieve the monetary policy goalsand to moderate the adverse economic impact resulting from the crisis. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, clickhere. Even before the economy managed to complete its exit process from the second lockdown, the increase in morbidity led the government to announce a third lockdown. As of now, the restrictions are looser than those imposed during the previous lockdowns. In particular, the education system continued its pre-lockdown activity routine. The Research Department's assessment is that under the current circumstances, the direct weekly cost of the third lockdown compared with a state of full economic activity is about NIS 2.5 billion. The Knesset dispersed without passing the state budget for 2021. Alongside this, the earlier-than-expected start of the inoculation campaign and the rapid pace of vaccinations thus far in Israel are expected to support economic recovery later in the year. The available indicators regarding economic activity in November and December show recovery of economic activity throughout the gradual exit from the second lockdown, but the variance of the impact between the industries continues. With the opening of street-front stores at the beginning of November, there was a jump in credit card purchases, and since then, the level has been slightly higher than it was prior to the crisis (Figure 3 in the attached data file). Mobility data indicate a return to activity at workplaces and markets. Goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds, in dollars) recovered, and were higher in October and November than they were prior to the crisis. Services exports (excluding tourism) continue to grow strongly (Figure 4). All components of goods imports (in dollars) also increased by high rates in November, to volumes slightly higher than they were prior to the crisis (Figure 5). The increase in the Current Account surplus continued in the third quarter, with an increase in the surplus in the services account and a reduction of the deficit in the goods account. The broad unemployment rate, which reached approximately 23 percent during the second lockdown, decline to about 12.7 percent in the first half of December, but is expected to again increase in view of the third lockdown (Figure 7). The impact on employment was higher in the industries that are characterized by low wages (Figure 8). Central Bureau of Statistics real-time surveys indicate an increase in the volume of business closures in the economy. The rate of business closures increases the smaller they are, as does the rate of those dismissed from the business. In view of the dispersal of the Knesset without passing the state budget for 2021, and in order to prevent large-scale cutbacks in government activity, the government increased the budget base for 2020 so that the interim budget in 2021 will be less restraining than was previously expected. The overall government deficit (excluding the provision of credit) at the end of 2020 is estimated at about 12 percent of GDP. The Bank of Israel Research Department revised its macroeconomic forecast for the coming two years, and estimates that the contraction of GDP in 2020 will be about 3.7 percent (Figure 1). The revised forecast features two potential scenarios that are influenced by the pace of inoculation of the population.In view of the start of the inoculation campaign, both scenarios are more positive than the forecast published in October. In the rapid inoculation scenario, in which toward the end of the second quarter the government no longer places significant restrictions on economic activity for health reasons. GDP is expected to grow by 6.3 percent in 2021, and the broad unemployment rate is expected to decline during the year to 7.7 percent of the labor force in the fourth quarter of 2021. In 2022. GDP is expected to grow by 5.8 percent, the unemployment rate is expected to continue to decline to 5.4 percent, and the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be 75 percent. In the slower inoculation scenario, which will last until the middle of 2022. GDP is expected to grow by 3.5 percent in 2021, and the broad unemployment rate is expected to decline to about 11 percent. In 2022. GDP growth is expected to be 6 percent, while unemployment is expected to decline to 7 percent, and the debt to GDP ratio in 2022 is expected to be 82 percent. In view of the fast pace of inoculation, it seems that currently, the rapid inoculation scenario is significantly more likely to play out than the slow scenario. The CPI for November decline by 0.2 percent, and inflation in the past 12 months was -0.6 percent (-0.2 percent net of energy and fruit and vegetables) (Figure 10). In the coming months, annual inflation is expected to remain negative. Inflation expectations for the coming year from the various sources increased slightly but remain below the lower bound of the target range. Expectations derived from the capital market continued to increase, partly in view of the increase in commodities and oil prices. Forward expectations from the second year onward remained virtually unchanged, and are within the target range. Medium- and long-term expectations remained anchored within the target range (Figure 13).</p> Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 1.5 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, by 2.8 percent against the US dollar, and by 0.6 percent against the euro. So far, it seems that exports are growing despite the appreciation, but at some point, the exchange rate could have a nonlinear effect on exports, and continued appreciation is expected to leadto a further slowdown of inflation (Figure 14). Home prices increased by 2.5 percent in the past year, while the pace of increase was more moderate in recent months. The volume of transactions in the housing market is lower than in the precrisis period, and there was a marked slowdown in building starts. The Banking Supervision Department directive cancelling the limitation on the Prime-linked component of mortgages is expected to lower the effective interest rate on such loans (Figure 21). However, according to the Business Tendency Survey, the difficulty in raising credit remains greater than it was prior to the crisis, mainly among small businesses (Figure 22). There was a marked slowdown in November in total loan repayment deferrals in the banking system. At the same time, the deferral period ended for about 60 percent of the total loans that were deferred in view of the crisis. There was a positive trend in the domestic capital market, as share indices in Tel Aviv increased, similar to the global trend, and corporate bond spreads continued to narrow. The global economy is recovering, but the uncertainty continues in view of the start of inoculation campaigns while morbidity continues to spread. A high level of variance is expected in the growth of various economies in 2021, and some countries are not expected to completely recover from the crisis even in 2022, mainly if there are further outbreaks of the virus and the pace of inoculations is slow (Figure 25). The high morbidity levels have led to a slowdown in the services sector, mainly in Europe, while the improvements in manufacturing and in world trade continue. Share prices in the capital markets continued to increase in view of the start of inoculation campaigns, with slight increases in US treasury bond yields. The increases of oil and industrial commodity prices continue but inflation is expected to remain low and the monetary policies of the major central banks remain very accommodative. In theUS, a fiscal incentive program was approved and the growth forecasts were revised upward, but private consumption and labor market data point to moderation in activity. In Europe, theincrease in morbidity is expected to lead to a contraction of activity in the fourth quarter, and growth forecasts for 2021 declined again. The agreement between the European Unionand the UK reduced the political uncertainty. In Japan, despite the increase in morbidity, real-time indicators point to improvement. The economic improvement in China continues in view of the improvement in consumer sentiment and the increase in demand for exports. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on January 18, 2020. The next decision regardingthe interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. February 22, 2021. The overall government deficit (excluding the provision of credit) at the end of 2020 is estimated at about 12 percent of GDP. The Bank of Israel Research Department revised its macroeconomic forecast for the coming two years, and estimates that the contraction of GDP in 2020 will be about 3.7 percent (Figure 1). Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 1.5 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, by 2.8 percent against the US dollar, and by 0.6 percent against the euro."
Poland,2021-01-13,"Warsaw, 13 January 2021 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 13 January 2021 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 0.10%; lombard rate at 0.50%; deposit rate at 0.00%; rediscount rate at 0.11%; discount rate at 0.12%. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. The timing and scale of the conducted measures will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. Data from the global economy indicate that as COVID-19 infections increased and the sanitary restrictions were tightened again, the global recovery slowed down in 2020 Q4. The situation deteriorated mainly in the services sector, while industrial activity continued to grow. At the same time, inflation in the global economy remains low. Forecasts point to a fall in GDP in the euro area in 2020 Q4. The central banks of the major economies are keeping interest rates low and conducting asset purchases. In recent months, expectations that vaccinations will have a positive impact on the further course of the pandemic have contributed to some improvement in global financial market sentiment, leading to an increase in the prices of some financial assets. At the same time, the prices of some commodities, including oil, increased in the global markets. In Poland, the rise in COVID-19 infections and the tightening of the pandemic restrictions in 2020 Q4 had a negative impact on economic activity, particularly in part of the services sector. October and November saw a drop in retail sales. The continued growth in industrial output suggests that the situation in this sector is relatively favourable. Current forecasts indicate that annual GDP growth in 2020 Q4 remained negative and was most likely lower than in the previous quarter. The labour market data for November point to a stabilisation of average employment and annual growth of average wages in the enterprise sector. At the same time, inflation in December  according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate  stood at 2.3% y/y (compared to 3.0% y/y in November). It can be expected that following the fall in GDP in 2020, economic activity will recover in 2021, although the scale of the recovery will mainly depend on the epidemiological situation and the related restrictions. The further course of the pandemic and its impact on the economic situation in Poland and abroad remain the main sources of uncertainty for the economic outlook in Poland. The economic policy measures, including the easing of NBP's monetary policy, will have a positive impact on the economic situation. However, growth in economic activity may be limited by the heightened uncertainty and the weaker sentiment of economic agents than before the pandemic, which will result in a significant slowdown in investment growth. The pace of economic recovery may also be reduced by the lack of a visible and more durable zloty exchange rate adjustment to the global pandemic shock and to the monetary policy easing introduced by NBP. These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in the secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In order to strengthen the impact of NBP's monetary policy easing on the economy. NBP may also intervene in the foreign exchange market. The timing and scale of the measures taken by NBP will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also continue to offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. NBP's monetary policy mitigates the negative economic impact of the pandemic, supports economic activity and stabilises inflation at the level consistent with NBP's medium-term inflation target. Due to its positive impact on the financial situation of debtors, it is also conducive to the strengthening of financial system stability."
Peru,2021-01-14,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT JANUARY 2021 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments: Inflation at the beginning of 2021 will lie at the center of the target range due to transitory factors; and inflation in 2021 is expected to be around the lower limit of the target range because even though domestic demand is recovering, economic activity remains below its potential level. One-year ahead expected inflation was 1.85 percent in December. Year-on-year inflation decreased from 2.1 percent in November to 2.0 percent in December due to lower food prices. Trend inflation remains in the lower part of the target range. Year-on- year core inflation was 1.76 percent in December. Leading indicators continued to improve in December at a higher than expected rate, although they remain below the levels recorded at the end of 2019, while firms' growth expectations moderated in December. Global economic activity has been improving, but it remains below the level observed in 2019. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows. As of January 13, the BCRP's liquidity injection operations totaled S/ 64.9 billion, of which S/ 50.6 billion were associated with government-backed repos. In this context, credit to the private sector grew 12.4 percent year-on-year in November with interest rates declining steadily since April. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The BCRP stands ready to expand monetary stimulus using a range of instruments. In particular, the BCRP has recently added new monetary Operations Conditional on the Expansion of Long-Term Credit in order to reinforce the transmission of its monetary policy actions towards long-term interest rates. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on February 11, 2021."
South Korea,2021-01-15,"The bank of korea. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period. Currently available information suggests that the recovery of the global economy has weakened due to the resurgence of COVID-19. In global financial markets, despite the coronavirus resurgence, stock prices and government bond yields in major countries have increased steeply and the US dollar has remained weak, due to the rollout of coronavirus vaccines and the consequent hopes for economic recovery. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by national policy responses and their effects. The Korean economy has continued to recover modestly. Although private consumption has contracted due to the recent coronavirus resurgence, facilities investment has continued to recover and export growth has increased, led by the IT sector. Labor market conditions have remained weak, with the number of persons employed continuing to decline sharply compared to the corresponding period last year. Going forward, the economy is likely to recover gradually, led by exports and investment. However, uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook are judged to remain elevated. GDP growth this year is projected to be around 3.0%, generally consistent with the November forecast. Consumer price inflation and core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) have remained low at the mid-0% level, reflecting prolonged effects from the decline in the prices of petroleum products and public services compared to the corresponding period last year. The inflation expectations of the general public have remained at the upper-1% level. It is forecast that consumer price inflation will run at the mid- to upper-0% level for some time and then moderately increase to around 1%. Core inflation is forecast to remain at the low- to mid-0% level. In domestic financial markets, stock prices have surged as the rise in stock prices in major countries and optimistic prospects for the performance of domestic corporations have heightened investors' risk appetite. Long-term market interest rates have increased, while the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fallen. Household loan growth has remained high and housing prices have accelerated in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the recovery in the Korean economy is expected to be modest and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to remain weak, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process the Board will thoroughly assess developments related to COVID-19 as well as the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic, while paying attention to changes in financial stability conditions such as fund flows to asset markets and household debt growth."
Romania,2021-01-15,"In its meeting of 15 January 2021, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The annual inflation rate continued to decline over the last two months of 2020, falling to 2.14 percent in November from 2.24 percent in October and to 2.06 percent in December  visibly below the mid-point of the target and marginally below the forecast , thus steepening its considerable drop against December 2019, when it had stood at 4.04 percent. Developments in the past two months were due to a relatively faster deceleration in core inflation, in a context in which the disinflationary impact of changes in VFE prices was counterbalanced by the influence of higher prices of fuels, tobacco products and electricity. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) decreased to 3.4 percent in November, from 3.6 percent in October, and to 3.3 percent in December 2020  in line with the latest forecast , mainly on account of the disinflationary base effects associated with the developments in the prices of some processed food items, as well as with the minor contribution from the slowdown in the depreciation of the leu against the euro in annual terms. The dynamics of this component continue to be marked by the pre-pandemic underlying inflationary pressures, reflecting, inter alia, the associated inflation expectations, to which add the influences from a rebound in consumption in the second half of 2020, as well as from supply-side disruptions and costs linked with the pandemic and with the measures to prevent the coronavirus spread. Average annual CPI inflation rate and average annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices dropped to 2.6 percent and 2.3 percent respectively in December from 2.9 percent and 2.7 percent respectively in October. In Q3, economic activity reversed a significant part of its previous contraction, declining at a slower pace in annual terms, i.e. -5.7 percent compared to -10.3 percent in Q2, given the 5.8 percent quarterly rise, after dropping by 12.2 percent in Q2; the recovery momentum was severely contained by the decline in agricultural output, in the absence of which the economy would have seen a slower fall in annual terms, i.e. -3.2 percent. The recovery owed mainly to household consumption, which saw a strong rebound after the lifting of mobility restrictions, amid, inter alia, the relatively improved labour market conditions and a renewed step-up in real disposable income. In turn, gross fixed capital formation continued to increase mildly in annual terms, in the context of a re-acceleration in the dynamics of construction, with a strong contribution from public investment, together with the support of government programmes. At the same time, the negative contribution of net exports to annual GDP dynamics decreased visibly, given that the significant upturn in exports outpaced the recovery of imports of goods and services, entailing also a fall in the trade deficit compared to the same period of the previous year. However, the current account deficit resumed its advance in annual terms, solely as a result of a new worsening of the primary income balance, on the back of flows of reinvested earnings. The latest statistical data point to faster-than-expected dynamics of economic activity in the first months of 2020 Q4, albeit markedly slower during the quarter overall, amid mixed sectoral developments, under the impact of a resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic and the fresh restrictions gradually implemented on the domestic front and across other EU countries, which are however less severe than those during the first wave. Thus. October through November, retail sales fully reversed the contraction seen in spring, visibly exceeding the February 2020 level and further recording positive annual dynamics; at the same time, market services to households saw their year-on-year decline widen considerably. In addition, the volume of construction works continued to expand at a two-digit annual pace, whereas the narrowing trend of the annual decline in industrial output almost came to a halt, the same as that in the trade deficit; also against this background, the current account deficit posted a larger advance versus the same year-earlier period. Financial market developments have recently reflected the influence exerted by the improvement in investor sentiment on the Romanian economy outlook and by the increase in global risk appetite, conducive also to the easing of money market liquidity conditions. Against this background, key interbank money market rates stuck to a downward path, which steepened afterwards, while yields on government securities followed a sharper downward course. In turn, the average interest rate on new loans went further down October through November overall versus the previous quarter's average, dropping in October to a 3-year low. The interest rate differential on the financial market contributed to the relative stability of the leu's exchange rate, in the context of its gradual decrease, in early January 2021 as well. The annual dynamics of credit to the private sector picked up further in the first two months of 2020 Q4  reaching 4.6 percent in November from 4.0 percent in September , amid the faster growth in leu-denominated loans to non-financial corporations, prompted by the IMM Invest Romania Programme and the overall downtrend in interest rates. The share of leu-denominated loans in total private sector credit widened to 69.3 percent in November, hitting a record-high for the post-January 1996 period. The latest assessments reconfirm the outlook for a slight step-up in the annual inflation rate January through February 2021, under the impact of supply-side factors, followed by a minor decline at end-Q1. These developments are in line with the latest medium-term forecast published in the November 2020 Inflation Report, which sees the inflation rate running close to the mid-point of the target over the policy-relevant horizon, amid the disinflationary effects from the aggregate demand deficit. Uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook stem from the future fiscal and income policy stance, at least until the approval of the 2021 general government budget to outline the coordinates of the necessary fiscal consolidation that will probably be initiated this year, according to some measures recently announced by the government; the consolidation requires support from the absorption of European funds allocated to Romania via the EU economic recovery package and multiannual budget. Also important are the uncertainties associated with the liberalisation, starting 1 January 2021, of the electricity market for household consumers, with more pronounced potential implications for the CPI dynamics. Significant uncertainties and risks also stem from the external environment, given the protraction of the current pandemic wave and of the associated mobility restrictions, weighing on the recovery of European economies, probably until the effects of vaccination campaigns become manifest. In today's meeting, based on the currently available data and assessments, as well as in light of the elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to cut the monetary policy rate to 1.25 percent per annum from 1.50 percent per annum starting 18 January 2021. Moreover, it decided to lower the deposit facility rate to 0.75 percent per annum from 1.00 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 1.75 percent per annum from 2.00 percent per annum. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board considers that, given the transmission lags of the policy rate impulses, such a calibration of the monetary policy conduct is likely to provide an underpinning to the recovery of economic activity over the projection horizon with a view to bringing and strengthening over the medium term the annual inflation rate in line with the 2.5 percent Â±1 percentage point inflation target, while safeguarding financial stability. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 26 January 2021, at 3:00 p.m. The NBR Board decision to suspend the calendar of monetary policy meetings remains in place and monetary policy meetings will be held whenever necessary."
Brazil,2021-01-20,"In its 236th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 2.00% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Regarding the global outlook, the increase in the number of cases and the emergence of new virus strains are reverting previous mobility gains and should affect short-term activity. However, new fiscal stimulus in some developed countries and the rollout of COVID-19 immunization programs should promote a solid economic recovery in the medium term. Economic slack and central bank communication from major economies suggest monetary stimuli will last long, resulting in a favorable environment for emerging economies. Turning to the Brazilian economy, indicators regarding growth at the end of last year have been better than expected, but they do not capture the effects of the recent increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Prospectively, uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than usual, especially for the first quarter of this year, concurrently with the expected unwinding of the emergency transfer programs. The recent increase in commodities prices and its effects on food and fuel prices imply an increase in inflation forecasts for the next months. In spite of the stronger short-term inflationary pressure, the Committee maintains the diagnosis that the current shocks are temporary, although more persistent than expected. Hence, the Copom continues to closely monitor the evolution of inflation, in particular core inflation readings. The various measures of underlying inflation are in levels above the range compatible with meeting the inflation target. Inflation expectations for 2021, 2022, and 2023 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.4%, 3.5%, and 3.25%, respectively; and. The Copom's inflation projections in its baseline scenario, with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and exchange rate starting at R$5.35/US$* and evolving according to the purchase power parity (PPP), stand around 3.6% for 2021 and 3.4% for 2022. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2021 at 3.25% p.a., and rises to 4.75% p.a. in 2022. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory, especially when slack is concentrated in the service sector. This risk increases if a slower reversion of the pandemic effects lengthens the environment of high uncertainty and precautionary savings. On the other hand, an extension of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that aggravate the fiscal path or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium. The relative increase in the risks of these events imply an upward asymmetry to the balance of risks, i.e., in the direction of higher-than-expected paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The Committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 2.00% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021 and, mainly, 2022. According to the forward guidance introduced in the 232nd meeting the Copom would not reduce the monetary stimulus as long as specified conditions were met. Based on new information, the Committee judges that those conditions no longer hold, as inflation expectations, as well as inflation projections for its baseline scenario, are sufficiently close to the inflation target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. Therefore, the forward guidance no longer holds and, henceforth, monetary policy will follow the usual analysis of the balance of risks for the prospective inflation. The Copom reiterates that the removal of the forward guidance does not mechanically imply interest rates increases, since, at this moment, uncertainties regarding the evolution of growth still prescribe an extraordinarily strong monetary stimulus. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fabio Kanczuk. Fernanda Feitosa Nechio. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Malaysia,2021-01-20,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 1.75 percent. The global economy continues to recover, led by improvements in manufacturing and export activity. However, the recent resurgences of COVID-19 cases and the subsequent containment measures have affected economic activity in several major economies. The expedited roll-out of mass vaccination programmes, together with ongoing policy support, are expected to lift global growth prospects going forward. Financial conditions also remain supportive. The overall outlook remains subject to downside risks, primarily if there is further resurgence of COVID-19 infections and delays in mass inoculation against COVID-19. For Malaysia, the resurgence in COVID-19 cases and the introduction of targeted containment measures has affected the recovery momentum in the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result, growth for 2020 is expected to be near the lower end of the earlier forecasted range. For 2021, while near-term growth will be affected by the re-introduction of stricter containment measures, the impact will be less severe than that experienced in 2020. The growth trajectory is projected to improve from the second quarter onwards. The improvement will be driven by the recovery in global demand, turnaround in public and private sector expenditure amid continued support from policy measures, and higher production from existing and new manufacturing and mining facilities. The roll-out of vaccines in the coming months will also lift sentiments. Downside risks to the outlook remain, stemming mainly from ongoing uncertainties surrounding the dynamics of the pandemic and potential challenges that might affect the roll-out of vaccines both globally and domestically. In line with earlier assessments, the average headline inflation is expected to be negative in 2020 due mainly to the substantially lower global oil prices. For 2021, headline inflation is projected to average higher, primarily due to higher global oil prices. Underlying inflation is expected to remain subdued amid continued spare capacity in the economy. The outlook, however, is subject to global oil and commodity price developments. The MPC considers the stance of monetary policy to be appropriate and accommodative. Given the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the stance of monetary policy going forward will be determined by new data and information, and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth. The Bank remains committed to utilise its policy levers as appropriate to create enabling conditions for a sustainable economic recovery. Bank Negara Malaysia 20 January 2021."
Turkiye,2021-01-21,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 17 percent. Economic activity is on a strong course. Although the downward effects of the pandemic-related restrictions on the economy are more confined compared to the second quarter of last year, the slowdown in activity in services and related sectors and uncertainties surrounding the short-run outlook of these sectors prevail. The strengthening domestic demand, due to the cumulative effects of high credit growth during the pandemic, continues to have an adverse effect on the current account balance. Nevertheless, credit growth has started to slow down amid tighter financial conditions. Domestic demand conditions, cumulative cost effects, in particular the exchange rate effects, increasing international food and other commodity prices and high levels of inflation expectations continue to affect the pricing behavior and inflation outlook adversely. The decelerating impact of the strong monetary tightening implemented in November and December MPC meetings on credit and domestic demand is expected to become more significant; hence the effects of demand and cost factors on inflation are envisaged to wane gradually. On the other hand, the developments in international commodity prices, supply constraints intensifying in some sectors, and the adjustments in wage and administered prices maintain their importance for the medium-term inflation outlook. Accordingly, the MPC, taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, has decided to maintain decisively the tight monetary policy stance for an extended period until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability. As regards to the indicators pointing to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability, indicators for the underlying trend of inflation and pricing behavior, diffusion indices, demand and cost factors, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely for their compatibility with the targets in the forecast horizon. Additional monetary tightening will be delivered if needed. The tight monetary policy stance, besides attaining permanent price stability, will foster macroeconomic and financial stability positively by facilitating the fall in country risk premium, the reversal in currency substitution, the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs. In its decision-making process, the CBRT adopts a framework with a medium term perspective, based on analyzing all factors affecting inflation and the interaction between these factors. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2021-01-21,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 6% per annum. The NBU continues to deliver on its commitment to reach the inflation target. Further on, the central bank will aim its monetary policy at striking the right balance between responding to inflation risks and supporting economic recovery. In 2020, inflation accelerated to 5%, reaching the midpoint of the target range. During most of last year, inflation was below the 5% Â± 1 pp target range. Falling global energy prices, as well as declining demand for non-staple goods and services, restrained price growth during the pandemic. At the same time, inflation increased expectedly at the end of the year. This was due to the rapid global economy recovery, the further strengthening of domestic consumer demand, and increases in prices for energy and certain foods. As a result, inflation in December returned to the target range. Inflation will accelerate in H1 2021, but will return to the 5% Â± 1 pp target range in H1 2022. The NBU has revised upwards its forecast for inflation in 2021 from 6.5% to 7%. Inflation will accelerate in H1 on the back of strong consumer demand, higher energy prices, and last year's lower harvests of agricultural crops. In addition, businesses will face higher production costs, in particular labor costs. Administered prices will continue to grow rapidly due to increases in electricity rates and excise taxes on tobacco products. Throughout the second half of the year, the impact of pro-inflationary factors will weaken, which will reverse the inflation pattern. Food price inflation will decelerate thanks to an increase in supply of newly-harvested agricultural products, and the effect of low comparison base will vanish for some goods at the end of the year. The NBU's monetary policy will also be aimed at reducing underlying pressures on prices due to robust consumer demand and at improving inflation expectations. As a result, it is expected that core inflation will be 5.9% at the end of 2021, and headline inflation will return to the target range in H1 2022. In 20222023, inflation will hover around the medium-term target of 5%. The economy contracted much less than expected in 2020. It will grow at the rate of around 4% in 2021 and the following years. The NBU estimates real GDP to decline by 4.4% in 2020, which is less than expected in the previous forecast (6%). The Ukrainian economy recovered rather quickly in H2. After the strict lockdown ended, the decline in GDP slowed to 3.5% yoy in Q3 and continued to decelerate in Q4. The tightening of quarantine restrictions in November had a minor impact on business activity. The rapid economic recovery was mainly driven by growth in domestic consumption. Increased household incomes and budget spending are keeping consumption high. Retail trade continued to grow rapidly in Q4. GDP dynamics were also improved by higher current budget expenditures on infrastructure, especially on road repairs, and on healthcare. On the other hand, companies' investment activity remained sluggish. In 2021, the economy will almost recover from the losses inflicted by the coronavirus crisis: Ukraine's GDP will rise by 4.2% and will continue to grow rapidly at around 4% in 20222023. Strong domestic demand will remain the main economic growth driver, underpinned by further increases in real household income. Lower uncertainty about the course of the pandemic will favor a recovery in investment activity. Having recorded a large surplus last year, the current account of the balance of payments will go into deficit again in 20212023. The surplus of Ukraine's current account is expected to hit one of its record-high levels, reaching 4.8% of GDP. In 20212023, however, the current account will return to deficit. Although the prices of, and external demand for. Ukraine's main exports will remain rather high, terms of trade will deteriorate due to rising energy prices. The economic recovery will also be accompanied by a gradual increase in investment imports. Consumer imports will continue to rise steadily, driven by the expected increase in household income. The primary assumption, underlying the NBU Board considerations, is that Ukraine will continue to cooperate with the IMF. In 2021. Ukraine expects to receive IMF financing under the current Stand-by Arrangement, as well as official financing from the EU, the World Bank, and other international partners. These funds will enable the country to finance a significant portion of the budget in 2021. Cooperation with the IMF remains an important signal for international investors. It will noticeably ease the government's access to the international markets, while also decreasing the cost of planned borrowing. Financing by the IMF and other international partners will enable Ukraine to maintain its international reserves at about USD 30 billion, despite making large repayments of external debt. The main risks to this forecast are a rise in coronavirus cases both in Ukraine and globally, and a larger inflow of foreign debt. Worldwide vaccination is reducing the risk of repeated lockdowns. However, given the slowness of the vaccination process and the emergence of new virus strains, there is a possibility of local quarantines, which will have negative consequences for economic activity. That said, extremely loose global monetary conditions and the optimism about vaccinations have significantly boosted the interest of foreign investors in emerging markets, including Ukraine. Large capital inflows could lower inflationary pressures through the exchange rate channel. Other risks also remain significant. an escalation of the military conflict in eastern Ukraine or on the country's borders, andhigher inflationary pressures arising from trading partnershigher volatility of global food prices, driven by global climate change and stronger protectionist measures worldwide.Given the current balance of risks, mostly temporary pro-inflationary factors, weak investment activity, and businesses' depressed sentiment amid the imposition of tighter quarantine measures, the NBU Board decided to keep the key policy rate unchanged in January 2021, at 6%. The NBU stands ready to raise its key policy rate in future to bring inflation back to its target. The NBU takes into account the worsening of inflation expectations that occurred in late 2020, as well as stronger underlying pressures on prices arising from consumer demand. If the impact of these factors continues to increase and is not offset by other factors, such as a large capital inflow, the NBU will raise its key policy rate. This will enable the central bank to curb the rise in inflation in 2021 and bring inflation back to its target in 2022. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the central bank's Inflation Report on 28 January 2021. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 1 February 2021. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 6%, was approved by an NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate   16-rsh dated 21 January 2021. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 4 March 2021, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
South Africa,2021-01-21,"PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 21 January 2021 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the November meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), a second wave of Covid-19 infections has peaked in South Africa and in many other countries. It is expected that these waves of infection will continue until vaccine distribution is widespread and populations develop sufficient immunity to curb virus transmission. Although the virus will continue in new waves, the rollout of vaccines is expected to boost global growth prospects generally. We have therefore revised global growth for 2021 higher.1 However, global distribution of vaccines is likely to be slow, creating an uneven pace of global economic recovery in 2021. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had forecast global gross domestic product (GDP) to have contracted by about 1 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. For 2020 this is now at -3.6% (up from -3.9% in November) and revised up to 5.0% for 2021. Based on the October 2020 World Economic Outlook, the IMF expects global growth of 5.2% in 2021. MPC Statement 21 January 2021 Page 1. MPC Statement 21 January 2021 Page 1 4.4% in 2020 and to expand by 5.2% in 2021 -- their new forecasts will be released on the 26th of January. While financial asset prices were volatile for much of the past year due to pandemic- related developments and geopolitical events, recent months have seen markets strengthen. Capital flows to emerging markets have generally picked up when compared to the outflows experienced in March and April last year. Although global policy rates look set to remain accommodative, risk aversion is likely to persist through 2021, particularly where economies fail to take advantage of improved global prospects or run large macroeconomic imbalances. In the third quarter of 2020, the South African economy grew by 66.1% quarter on quarter, seasonally adjusted and annualised, compared to the Bank's expected 50.3% growth. The growth rate for the full year is now expected to be -7.1%, compared to the contraction of 8.0% expected at the time of the November meeting. However, our projection for the 4th quarter of 2020 is expected to be lower than previously forecast. And while lockdown restrictions currently in place are considerably less restrictive than in 2020, we expect growth in the first quarter of 2021 to remain muted. Despite very robust terms of trade and stronger exports, getting back to pre-pandemic output levels will take time. Sharply lower public and private investment last year and continued weakness in 2021 will weigh on growth prospects. Overall, risks to the domestic growth outlook are assessed to be balanced. Global growth, vaccine distribution, a low cost of capital and high commodity prices are supportive of growth. However, new waves of the Covid-19 virus are likely to periodically weigh on economic activity both globally and locally. In addition, constraints to the domestic supply of energy, weak investment and uncertainty about vaccine rollout remain serious downside risks to domestic growth. Accommodative policies in many advanced economies and the improved economic outlook continue to support recovery in global financial markets and some strengthening in international capital flows. So far this has resulted in a trickle of fresh 2 Compared to 3.5% and 2.4%, respectively, in November. MPC Statement 21 January 2021 Page 2. MPC Statement 21 January 2021 Page 2 capital flows to South Africa, and financing conditions remain uncertain as reflected in the exceptionally steep yield curve.3 These favourable global conditions saw the rand appreciate by 1.7% since the November meeting. Since January 2020, the rand has, however, depreciated by 8.0% against the USD and remains below its estimated long-run equilibrium value. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R15.70 to the US dollar, compared with R16.50 at the time of the previous meeting. Headline consumer price inflation averaged 3.3% in 2020, in line with the Bank's expectation, and is the lowest rate since 2004. The Bank's forecast for 2021 is slightly higher at 4.0% (up from 3.9%) and is 4.5% (up from 4.4%) for 2022. Core inflation averaged 3.3% in 2020. The forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are unchanged at 3.4% and 4.0%, respectively. In 2023, core inflation is expected to be 4.3%. Despite an upward revision to potential growth, higher growth in 2020 and in 2021 implied a small narrowing of the output gap over the forecast period, compared to the November meeting. Global producer price inflation, food price inflation and oil prices have risen.4 A more appreciated nominal exchange rate in recent months is expected, however, to moderate some inflationary pressure. The overall risks to the inflation outlook appear to be balanced in the near and medium term. Local food price inflation is higher but expected to remain broadly contained. The Committee additionally notes the significant but likely temporary reduction in medical insurance price inflation this year. Given low pass-through, risks to inflation from currency depreciation are expected to stay muted. However, additional exchange rate pressures could result from fiscal risks. While there are no demand side pressures evident, electricity and other administered prices remain serious concerns. Expectations of future inflation appear more stable after sustained moderation last year, although those of households continue to moderate from quite high levels. 3 Measured by the EMBI+ premium over emerging market averages and as an absolute value over time. 4 Our assumptions are now for oil prices to average about $50 per barrel in 2021, rising to $55 per barrel in 2022 and $57 per barrel in 2023. MPC Statement 21 January 2021 Page 3. MPC Statement 21 January 2021 Page 3 Market-based expectations for short and medium-term inflation have eased slightly, while longer-term inflation expectations remain higher.5 The Committee notes that the slow economic recovery will help keep inflation below the midpoint of the target range for this year and next. Unless risks outlined earlier materialise, inflation is expected to be well contained in 2021, before rising to around the midpoint in 2022 and 2023. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep rates unchanged at 3.5% per annum. Two members of the Committee preferred a 25 basis point cut and three preferred to hold rates at the current level. The implied policy rate path of the Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) indicates two increases of 25 basis points in the second and third quarters of 2021. Monetary policy has eased financial conditions and improved the resilience of households and firms to the economic implications of Covid-19, and continues to be accommodative. The steps taken by the Bank have ensured adequate liquidity in domestic markets. In addition, regulatory relief provided to banks has sustained lending to households and firms. While monetary policy will continue to support the economic recovery, a faster growth rate depends on implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Lower administered prices and productivity-adjusted wage settings aligned to projected inflation would also generate important macroeconomic gains. Such steps will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy. Economic and financial conditions are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. In this highly uncertain environment, policy decisions will continue to be data 5 The latest Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey expectations for 2020 are 0.1ppt higher at 3.7%, unchanged in 2021 at 4.2% and 0.1ppt lower in 2022 at 4.5%. Household inflation expectations have eased further to 5.3% from 5.9%. Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) expect inflation to remain unchanged at 3.3% for 2020, lower at 3.8% in 2021 and at 4.2% in 2022. Inflation is expected to be 4.5% in 2023. Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These sit at 3.2% for the 5-year and 5.0% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year breakeven inflation sits at 6.2%. MPC Statement 21 January 2021 Page 4.

Kazakhstan,2021-01-25,"1 The base rate remains unchanged at 9% January 25, 2021 Nur-Sultan The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to maintain the base rate at 9.0% with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1.0 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities set on 10.00% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities  8.00%. The decision was made with a purpose to return inflation to the target band of 4-6% in the medium term and was based on the shift in the balance of risks towards the pro-inflationary factors. External and internal inflationary pressures have increased, the risks of a further rise in food prices have risen, and inflationary expectations are growing. There is also remaining uncertainty associated with coronavirus infection in the country and in the world. The annual inflation rate at the end of 2020 was in line with the forecasts of the National Bank and amounted to 7.5%. Food inflation accelerated to 11.3% (YoY) as a result of a significant rise in prices for butter, eggs, sugar and vegetables, driven by the dynamics of world prices and prices set by domestic producers. Non-food inflation amounted to 5.5% (YoY). While the growth in prices for clothing, footwear, fuels and lubricants slowed down, prices for medicines, household items and household appliances increased, which was due to the epidemiological situation, as well as the persistence of demand in the conditions of remote work and study. Acceleration of the inflation of paid services to 4.2% (YoY) was due to the rise in the cost of unregulated paid services. The main contribution was provided by the annual growth in the cost of catering services, hotel services, certain types of personal services and personal care services amid a gradual demand recovery. Core inflation indicators demonstrate the acceleration of inflationary processes. Thus, the annualized seasonally adjusted core inflation, excluding fruits and vegetables, regulated utilities, rail transport, communications, gasoline, diesel fuel and coal, accelerated in December 2020 to 7.9% (in September-October - 5-6%). Inflation expectations remain elevated, with a slight decrease in the quantitative estimate of expected inflation for the year ahead to 7.6% in December 2020. The share of respondents expecting the continuation of the current or faster growth in prices amounted to 50% (in November 2020 - 52%). The economy of Kazakhstan in 2020 contracted by 2.6%, which is in line with the forecasts of the National Bank. The main negative contribution to the contraction of GDP was made by the decline in the mining industry, trade and transport. The downturn in the mining industry was due to a production decrease of oil and gas condensate. The reduction in transport was facilitated by a decrease in the volume of cargo and passenger traffic. The negative dynamics of trade is associated with the persistence of quarantine restrictions and suppressed demand. Meanwhile, the manufacturing industry, agriculture, construction, information and communications, as well as the public sector made a positive contribution to the GDP dynamics. The survey polls of enterprises led by the National Bank indicate an improvement in sentiment in the real sector. Starting from July 2020, the business activity index continues to rise to the 50-point mark, reaching 49.0 points in December. Enterprises note an improvement in the business environment - the business climate index for the economy of Kazakhstan in December 2020 amounted to 4.2 (in November - 1.3). The deterioration of the situation in the global economy amid the pandemic was also reflected in a gradual slowdown in the growth of nominal money income of households of Kazakhstan - from 13.8% in March to 2.1% in November 2020 (YoY). Along with this, the acceleration of inflationary processes led to a decrease in the real money income of households (a decrease by 4.8% in November 2020). However, in the second half of the year there is a slight recovery in consumer demand of households, associated mainly with food consumption and a weak recovery of the non- food products consumption. With the vaccination against COVID-19 started in large countries, the situation in the global economy remains weakly positive due to the strengthening quarantine restrictions in a number of countries and the emergence of new strains of the virus. The industrial sector of developed countries and the further growth of foreign trade indicators in China continue to provide significant support to the global economy. The dynamics of annual inflation in the countries being the trading partners continues to evolve in different directions. In December 2020, the annual inflation rate in the EU was 0.2%. In China, after deflation in November 2020, inflation rose to 0.2%. In turn, in Russia, there is an acceleration of inflation to 4.9%, which, coupled with an increase in world food prices, indicates an increased external inflationary background. Monetary conditions of the countries being the trading partners remain easing. The situation in the global oil market has improved slightly, which is explained by the new OPEC+ agreement, the expectation of mass vaccinations and the subsequent recovery of the world economy. With the support of these factors, the price of Brent crude oil has risen above 55 US dollars per barrel since the beginning of January 2021. Despite the uncertainty of the prospects for the oil market development, the estimate of the expected oil consumption was slightly increased in the latest forecasts of international organizations. Along with this, due to the current recovery in oil prices, it is expected that the supply of oil will also increase. According to EIA forecasts, in 2021 and 2022 the price of Brent crude oil on average will be 52.8 and 53.4 US dollars per barrel, respectively. Further decisions on the base rate will be made taking into account the actual dynamics of inflation, its compliance with the forecasted estimates, the rate of deceleration and stabilization of inflation expectations, and also the balance of risks. The next planned decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on March 9, 2021 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time.

Nigeria,2021-01-26,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 134 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON MONDAY 25th AND TUESDAY 26th JANUARY 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held its first statutory meeting for the year 2021 on the 25th and 26th January on the backdrop of dampened optimism for improvement in global output recovery, associated with the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic and mild success with vaccinations across several countries. On the domestic front, recovery is expected to progress reasonably, following the mild contraction recorded during the third quarter of 2020 and with fourth quarter output growth figures expected to show further improvement. The Committee reviewed the developments in the global and domestic economic and financial environments in 2020 and the outlook for 2021 as well as the risks to this outlook. Ten (10) members of the Committee were in attendance. Global Economic Developments The Committee noted a better-than-expected recovery in most economies towards the end of 2020, leading to moderation in the contraction of global output. It however, observed that the rapid spread of the new variant of the Coronavirus, seemingly associated spike in fatalities and the recent re- introduction of containment measures across several economies, may dampen the recovery in 2021. In the Advanced Economies, headwinds largely associated with the COVID-19 pandemic such as vaccination-related challenges, weak aggregate demand associated with less than full employment in labour markets, partially functioning supply chain networks, the rapid spread of the new variant of the Coronavirus and a high infection rate dampened the initial rebound in economic recovery towards the end of 2020. Global Economic Developments The Committee noted a better-than-expected recovery in most economies towards the end of 2020, leading to moderation in the 1 contraction of global output. It however, observed that the rapid spread of the new variant of the Coronavirus, seemingly associated spike in fatalities and the recent re-introduction of containment measures across several economies, may dampen the recovery in 2021. Output growth in the Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) remained uneven across countries. In China, output slowed marginally in the 1 third and fourth quarters of 2020, following a faster-than-expected rebound in the second quarter of 2020. Following the lull in the second quarter. India's economy grew sharply in the third quarter, reflecting welcome adjustment to the stimulus measures. Accordingly the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated global growth in 2020 as a contraction of 44 per cent and forecast growth in 2021 to improve to 52 per cent. This forecast is however, hinged on the successful vaccination of a significant number of people to create the much-desired herd immunity. In China, output slowed marginally in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, following a faster-than-expected rebound in the second quarter of 2020. On price developments, the MPC noted that inflation, in most Advanced Economies, is likely to remain subdued in the short to medium term as the recent rise in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates have resulted in sub- optimal employment and weakened labour markets, which dampened aggregate demand across these economies. In the EMDEs, however, inflation remains relatively high compared with the Advanced Economies, with some economies confronted with stronger upside risks than others, as a result of weak accretion to reserves, persisting exchange rate pressures, poor inflow of capital as well as longstanding structural issues. The MPC noted the steady build-up of systemic liquidity across the global economy, arising from the support by fiscal authorities and central banks to bolster the recovery and return confidence to the financial markets. It noted that the response to the pandemic has heightened the risk of debt accumulation, raising concerns of debt sustainability and vulnerability of the global economy to financial crisis once central banks commence normalization of monetary policy. On price developments, the MPC noted that inflation, in most Advanced Economies, is likely to remain subdued in the short to medium term as the recent rise in COVID-19 infection and mortality 2 rates have resulted in sub-optimal employment and weakened labour markets, which dampened aggregate demand across these economies. Domestic Economic Developments Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), contracted by 362 per cent in Q3 2020, compared with 610 per cent in Q2 2020 and a growth of 228 per cent in the corresponding period of 2019. The real GDP contraction in Q3 2020 was largely driven by the decline of 1389 per cent in the oil sector from 663 per cent in Q2 2020. The non-oil sector also contracted by 251 per cent in Q3 2020, compared with 605 per cent in Q2 2020. The weak performance observed in both the oil and non-oil sectors was largely attributed to the lag effects of the lockdown, persisting weak global demand for crude oil and security challenges across the country. The MPC noted with concern the continuing sluggish recovery in the Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMIs), which remained below the 50-index point benchmark in December 2020, at 496 and 457 index points, respectively, compared with 502 and 476 index points during the previous month. This weak performance was attributed to the resurgence of the pandemic, foreign exchange pressures, increased costs of production, general increase in prices and decline in economic activities. The weak performance observed in both the oil 3 and non-oil sectors was largely attributed to the lag effects of the lockdown, persisting weak global demand for crude oil and security challenges across the country. Similar trend was also observed in the employment level index component of the manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs, which contracted for the ninth consecutive month in December 2020 to 463 and 451 index points, respectively, compared with 502 and 467 index points in the previous month. The Committee, however, noted that current growth headwinds would likely moderate in the short to medium term, as the containment measures and the sustained implementation of economic stimulus permeate the domestic economy. This uptick 4 was attributed to the increase in both the food and core components of inflation, which rose to 1956 and 1137 per cent in December 2020, respectively, from 1830 and 1101 per cent in November 2020. The Committee expressed concerns on the persisting uptick in inflationary pressure for the sixteenth consecutive month, with headline year-on-year inflation moving further to 1575 per cent in December 2020 from 1489 per cent in November 2020. This uptick was attributed to the increase in both the food and core components of inflation, which rose to 1956 and 1137 per cent in December 2020, respectively, from 1830 and 1101 per cent in November 2020. This continued upsurge in food inflation was attributed to the logistical bottlenecks, spurred by the increasing security challenges in many parts of the country, which disrupted food production and supply to the market. Other factors driving the core inflation, include the recent deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil industry, which led to hikes in the price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) and the upward adjustment in electricity tariff. This was largely attributed to the Bank's policy on Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR), complemented by its interventions in various sectors of the economy. The Committee, however, noted that as output rebounds, supported by the suites of stimulus packages by both the Federal Government and the Central Bank, inflationary pressure would likely begin to moderate in the near term. Consequently banking sector gross credit as at end-December 5 2020 stood at N2502 trillion compared with N2425 trillion at the end of November 2020, representing an increase of N77428 billion. On the performance of monetary aggregates, the Committee noted the further growth in broad money supply (M3) to 1097 per cent in December 2020 from 502 per cent in November 2020, driven largely by the growth in Net Foreign Assets. It also noted the expansion in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) to 496 per cent from -045 per cent in the previous period. Aggregate domestic credit, also moved further up by 1340 per cent in December 2020, compared with 948 per cent in the previous month. This was largely attributed to the Bank's policy on Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR), complemented by its interventions in 3 various sectors of the economy. Consequently banking sector gross credit as at end-December 2020 stood at N2502 trillion compared with N2425 trillion at the end of November 2020, representing an increase of N77428 billion. Under the Bank's real sector interventions, under the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP). N55463 billion had been disbursed to 2,,849,,490 beneficiaries since the inception of the programme, of which N6102 billion was allocated to 359,,370 dry season farmers. We have also disbursed N10696 billion to 27,,956 beneficiaries under the Agri- Business Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS), while in the Health Care Support Intervention Facility, we have disbursed N7296 billion to 73 project that comprise 26 pharmaceutical projects and 47 Hospitals and Health Care Services Project in the country. On enhancing power supply, the Bank has so far, provided N1858 billion for the procurement of 347,,853 6 electricity reading meters to Discos in support of the National Mass Metering Programme. In light of the on-going synchronized efforts by the monetary and fiscal authorities to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank has committed substantial amount of money towards this objective. Indeed total disbursements as at January 2021 amounted to N20 trillion. COVID-19 Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) meant for household and small businesses, wherein we have disbursed N19264 billion to 426,,016 beneficiaries. We have also disbursed N10696 billion to 27,,956 beneficiaries under the Agri-Business Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS), while in the Health Care Support Intervention Facility, we have disbursed N7296 billion to 73 project that comprise 26 pharmaceutical projects and 47 Hospitals and Health Care Services Project in the country. To support the provision of employment opportunities for the Nigerian youth, the Central Bank of Nigeria also provided financial support through the Creative Industry Financing Initiative and Nigerian Youth Investment Fund amounting to N312 billion with 320 beneficiaries and N268 million with 395 beneficiaries, respectively. On enhancing power supply, the Bank has so far, provided N1858 billion for the procurement of 347,,853 electricity reading meters to Discos in support of the National Mass Metering Programme. The Committee urged the Bank to sustain its current drive to improve access to credit to the private sector while exploring other complementary initiatives, in collaboration with the Federal Government, to improve funding to critical sectors of the economy. During the period under review, money market rates remained low, reflecting the prevailing liquidity conditions in the banking system. Overall the monthly weighted average Open Buy Back (OBB) rates declined further from the 113 per cent in November 2020 to 109 per cent in December 2020. On the equities market, the Committee noted the positive performance, particularly the sustained patronage by domestic investors largely driven by the prevailing low yields in the money market. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) grew by 180 per cent to N2144 trillion from N2106 trillion over the same period. This improved performance was largely attributed to gains recorded in medium and large capitalized companies, notably in consumer goods, banking, insurance and oil and gas sectors. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), however, noted the marginal increase in the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio which rose to 601 per cent at end-December 2020 from 588 per cent at end-November 2020 and above the prudential maximum threshold 7 of 50 per cent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), however, noted the marginal increase in the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio which rose to 601 per cent at end- December 2020 from 588 per cent at end-November 2020 and above the prudential maximum threshold of 50 per cent. While noting that this development is not unexpected under the prevailing circumstances, it urged the Bank to strengthen its macroprudential framework to bring NPLs below the prescribed benchmark. On the external reserves position, the Committee noted the increase in the level of external reserves, which stood at US$3623 billion as at 21st January, 2021 compared with US$3494 billion at the end of November 2020. This reflected improvements in crude oil prices, partial global economic recovery amid optimism over the discovery and distributions of COVID-19 vaccines by most developed economies. Outlook Overall, the medium-term outlook for both the domestic and global economies continued to show improved prospects of recovery, supported by the recent moderate uptick in crude prices and increased optimism over the procurement and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Available data and forecasts for key macroeconomic variables for the Nigerian economy suggest further improvement in output growth in the first quarter of 2021. This would be supported by the coordinated and sustained interventions of the monetary and fiscal authorities, including the broad-based stimulus and liquidity injections. Inflationary pressure is also expected to commence moderation as the economy's negative output gap closes. However, underlying uncertainties in the oil market and current uptick in the second wave COVID-19 infection rate may pose some downside risks to this forecast. However underlying uncertainties in the oil market and current uptick in the second wave COVID-19 infection rate may pose some downside risks to this forecast. The Committee's Considerations The Committee noted the moderation in output contraction in the third quarter of 2020, associated with news of the discovery of COVID-19 vaccines and rising oil prices. The outlook for the recovery, however, appears to be dampened by the second wave of the pandemic considering its intensity. This is in addition to effectively collaborating with the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 through the existing private sector Coalition against COVID-19 (CACOVID) to procure and 9 distribute vaccines to fast-track the pick-up of business activities and economic recovery. In the Committee's consideration, it noted that the COVID-19 pandemic and the necessary measures put in place by the Government to forestall its public health impact, such as the lockdown and other associated restrictions, contributed to the Nigerian economy going into recession, much like almost every other country in the world. Members thus agreed that the Committee's current priority remains to quicken the pace of the recovery through sustained and targeted spending by the fiscal authority supported by the Bank's interventions. In this light, it was thought necessary to increase collaboration with the fiscal authority by providing complementary spending to finance productive ventures in a bid to improve aggregate supply and reduce prices. This is in addition to effectively collaborating with the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 through the existing private sector Coalition against COVID-19 (CACOVID) to procure and distribute vaccines to fast-track the pick-up of business activities and economic recovery. Members reiterated the adverse impact of insecurity on food production, stressing that the current uptick in inflationary pressure could not be solely associated to monetary factors, but due mainly to legacy structural factors across the economy, including major supply bottlenecks across the country. The Committee commended the Bank's effort of improving liquidity in the foreign exchange market, but noted the need to continue to explore avenues to improve inflow from sources such as the International Money Transfer Operators (IMTO), diaspora 10 remittances and non-oil export promotion, given the current trajectory of crude oil prices. The Committee, thus called on the Government to redouble efforts at strengthening infrastructural efficiency and address the emerging security challenges in the country. In addition to this, the Committee called on the Government to explore the option of effective partnership with the private sector to improve funding sources necessary to address the huge infrastructural financing deficit. The Committee expressed concern over the rising public debt stock, as recurrent expenditure remained relatively high, compared with capital expenditure, thus, signalling future debt servicing challenges. To improve Government revenue sources and investment in capital, the Committee called on the Government to take advantage of the take-off of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which could boost domestic production and generate sizeable revenues for Government, as well as improve domestic productivity and competitiveness. The Committee commended the Bank for maintaining a sound regulatory surveillance over the banking system by ensuring a reasonably low level of non-performing loans (NPLs), even with the aggressive credit expansion programme during this crisis period. The Committee commended the Bank's effort of improving liquidity in the foreign exchange market, but noted the need to continue to explore avenues to improve inflow from sources such as the International Money Transfer Operators (IMTO), diaspora remittances and non-oil export promotion, given the current trajectory of crude oil prices. These sources, in the view of the Committee, would boost foreign exchange supply and ease the current exchange rate pressure. The Committee noted the continued improvement in the equities market as a lead indicator of medium-term macroeconomic recovery, thus, urging the Bank to maintain its collaboration with the fiscal authority to improve the investment climate towards attracting sustainable Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). In the Committee's consideration, it noted the broad-based global stimulus packages, including expanded credit lines, asset purchase programme, corporate bond purchase, additional funding facilities for financial system, commercial paper purchases, special central bank lending, increase in the Ways and Means limits introduced by the central banks of different countries to support economic recovery in their various economies and to prevent further distortions to the economy caused by the devastating impact of 11 the pandemic. The Committee commended the Bank for maintaining a sound regulatory surveillance over the banking system by ensuring a reasonably low level of non- performing loans (NPLs), even with the aggressive credit expansion programme during this crisis period. Though NPLs remained slightly above the prudential benchmark, members noted that the banking system remained stable, strong and resilient. Given the success recorded under the LDR policy, it thus urged the Bank to sustain its risk surveillance approach and ensure the continued soundness of the banking system. In the Committee's consideration, it noted the broad-based global stimulus packages, including expanded credit lines, asset purchase programme, corporate bond purchase, additional funding facilities for financial system, commercial paper purchases, special central bank lending, increase in the Ways and Means limits introduced by the central banks of different countries to support economic recovery in their various economies and to prevent further distortions to the economy caused by the devastating impact of the pandemic. The Committee noted the large stimulus packages deployed by many countries to fast-track growth recovery and restore livelihoods across the world. For instance. Japan provided stimulus package valued at 669 per cent of its 2019 GDP; UK, 4504 per cent; USA, 284 per cent; Brazil, 276 per cent; South Africa, 126 per cent; China, 115 per cent; India, 100 per cent; and Russia 71 per cent compared with Nigeria's paltry 40%. The MPC, therefore, urged the Bank to further expand its current stimulus packages to support the fiscal interventions to reflate and boost recovery in the economy. The Committee's Decision At this meeting. MPC was, as in the last meeting, confronted with a policy dilemma as to whether to aggressively combat the inflationary pressure or support measures currently aimed at stimulating growth and reversing the recession. MPC was of the view, that whereas there may be wisdom in loosening, given that the impact of the global Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in constrained activities, disruption to supply chain and suppress aggregate demand, an accommodative stance may be 12 required to stimulate credit expansion and boost recovery in the short term. Although the economy is currently in a stagflation environment with simultaneous occurrence of inflationary pressures and contracting output, the MPC resolved to reverse both developments and continue pursuing price stability in growing the economy. MPC was of the view, that whereas there may be wisdom in loosening, given that the impact of the global Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in constrained activities, disruption to supply chain and suppress aggregate demand, an accommodative stance may be required to stimulate credit expansion and boost recovery in the short term. The Committee was also of the view that an expansionary policy would enable the monetary authorities convince the financial institutions to reduce loan pricing and defer interest and principal repayments to critically affected obligors in a sustainable manner. On the flip side. MPC also opined that an aggressive expansionary stance may worsen both inflation and the negative real interest rate, thereby resulting in negative consequences on exchange rate. With regard to tightening. MPC concluded that this may run contrary to its objectives of providing affordable credit to households. MSMEs. Agriculture, and other output growth and employment stimulating sectors of the economy. It also encouraged the Central Bank of Nigeria Management to intensify its efforts in the targeted credit facility to household. SMEs, 13 the Health Sector, as well as Agric and manufacturing sectors which would not only boost consumer spending but result in manufacturing output thereby positively impacting the GDP. On this basis, the MPC agreed to hold all policy parameters constant. MPC was therefore of the view that it should pursue its current stance of systematic synchronization of monetary and fiscal policy accommodation through its developmental finance initiatives, aimed at mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Nigerians. While expressing understanding of the public health dilemma of the recent spike in infections. MPC encouraged Government not to consider a wholesome lockdown of the economy so as not to reverse the current gains of the stimulus earlier provided in 2020. It also encouraged the Central Bank of Nigeria Management to intensify its efforts in the targeted credit facility to household. SMEs, the Health Sector, as well as Agric and manufacturing sectors which would not only boost consumer spending but result in manufacturing 8 output thereby positively impacting the GDP. On this basis, the MPC agreed to hold all policy parameters constant. The Committee thus decided by a unanimous vote to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 115 per cent. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Retain the MPR at 115 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 275 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 26th January 2021 14. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 26th January 2021 9 PERSONAL STATEMENTS BY THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEMBERS 1. ADAMU EDWARD LAMETEK The global economy continues to show prospects of recovery with contraction in output moderating in most countries. From an estimated contraction of about 40 per cent in 2020, the World Bank currently projects global output growth in 2021 at about 40 per cent, underpinned by a rebound in trade, currently forecast at about 70 per cent, from -92 per cent in 2020. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) sees a stronger recovery outlook with a projection of global growth for 2021 of over 50 per cent. The current optimism about global output recovery hinges substantially on developments around the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the pace and spread of vaccination and continued easing of global financial conditions. Global growth recovery in 2021 is expected to benefit from strong output performance in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) led by China and India. Growth in the EMDEs cluster is expected to be boosted by the rising trends in the prices of commodities and trade generally. Uncertainties remain, however. The second/third wave of COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the resumption of lockdowns in parts of Europe and Asia. In addition, the huge adjustment cost of the pandemic on the global economy could slow the engines of growth, just as would financial fragilities in many countries as the growth shock impacts vulnerable households and businesses. The Nigerian economy slipped into a recession in Q3 2020 following months of COVID-19 induced lockdowns, oil price crash and inflationary pressures. Thanks to early monetary and fiscal policy responses, the outlook for the economy has significantly improved. At the January meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). I could see from the available data credible indications of a fast climb out of recession. First the real economy had been largely insulated from the pandemic shock waves due to some of the policies implemented earlier by the CBN including a benchmark loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR), 10 innovations around CRR and development finance interventions. Second output recovery commenced during the next quarter (Q3) following the initial contraction in Q2 2020. At -362 percent. Q3 2020 real GDP actually grew by over 10 per cent relative to Q2 2020, even though not enough to stave-off a recession. Third the outlook for global output recovery continued to strengthen, with EMDEs leading the way - commodity prices and demand for imports were already firming by the beginning of Q4 2020 - supported by relentless policy efforts globally, aimed at containing COVID-19 and resuming full economic activity. The data presented also highlighted some important downside risks - a second wave of COVID-19 infections in the country, insecurity and rising inflation, especially food. Among other consequences, inflation beyond a certain threshold can undermine the output recovery gains. Yet to effectively address inflation, its origin and character must be well understood. Among others. I could see the dominant influence of high production cost and distribution bottlenecks in the current inflation dynamics. Of course, the effect of the easy stance of monetary policy cannot be completely discounted. However given that food prices have remained the major driver of the overall domestic price pressure, the role of money can be assumed to be minimal. As such, the correct policy-mix must continue to include a focus on alleviating supply from both production and distribution sides. Essentially there is no one policy instrument that can mitigate all the risks in the horizon. In fact, some of the risks cannot be addressed using the monetary instruments of the Central Bank alone. Therefore I saw clearly the need for greater policy coordination and synchronization of effort. To be clear. I view policy coordination across economic management institutions at the federal level as essential as response coordination across the tiers of government, particularly the states and the federal. 1 In coming to the decision to hold the monetary policy position at the January 2021 meeting of the MPC. I considered several other factors. First the outlook for private credit, which holds the key to rapid output recovery, continues to be stable in view of the stability of the banking system. Key financial soundness indicators (capital adequacy ratio, liquidity ratio, non-performing loan ratio, and earnings) have remained strong, suggesting continued resilience of the industry. Second the impact of previous actions of the Committee aimed at supporting the real sector, particularly the LDR and the differentiated cash reserves requirement (DCRR) and the COVID-19 special interventions are getting stronger. Third the inflationary pressures on the economy could begin to ease early in the year owing to the dissipation of the base effect, as well as the decision of government to reopen the country's land borders. In fact, the month-on-month inflation slowed in December 2020. In addition to providing stimulus for growth, the emerging consensus globally appears to be that public policy priorities must include managing the adverse consequences of rising public debt, declining fiscal sustainability, strengthening public health and ensuring price stability particularly in EMDEs. There is no doubt, doing all of these (and urgently so) poses a huge challenge for most countries just as it does for Nigeria. For the CBN, the policy complexity is obvious, when priorities are viewed against available instruments. Having to deal with inflation during a recession requires a great deal of innovation and a delicate deployment of instruments. The supply-side approach to economic stability that has embodied the Bank's policy responses in recent quarters continues to be relevant in my view. therefore voted to maintain the extant policy position. In effect. I voted at the January 2021 meeting of the MPC to: I Retain the asymmetric corridor at +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; II. Retain the MPR at 115 per cent; 12 III. Retain the CRR at 275 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. ADENIKINJU. ADEOLA FESTUS Economic Developments The global economy is expected to recover in 2021 from the negative growth in 2020. Commodity prices, including crude oil prices, are expected to stay above the 2020 average in 2021. Most indicators point to a âV-shaped' recovery. However the new wave of COVID-19 may dampen the pace of output growth recovery. Experts are of the opinion that vaccination is the key to permanently deal with the impacts of the virus. As global economy picks up. OPEC may likely relax its production quota which will help Nigeria to increase its production and exports. Global trade is widely expected to regain most of its loss in 2020 as it grows from -92% in 2020 to 72% in 2021. From the presentations of the Bank's Staff, the Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI) remain strong, although there is a slight deterioration in the CAR and the 13 NPLs ratio. Similarly NPLs ratio rose from 57% in October 2020 to 60% in December 2020. Bank Assets. Credits and Deposits continue to be strong and recorded growth since the last MPC Meeting. The Liquidity Ratio. LR, is above the minimum Prudential Guidelines. Both the Return on Equity and Return on Assets increased from their levels as at the November 2020 meeting. The various stress tests confirm that the financial system is consistently strong. The Economic Report shows continuous rise in domestic inflation rate. Headline inflation rose from 1489% in November 2020 to 1575% in December 2020, making it the 16th consecutive increase and highest since January 2018. Food inflation also hit a 3-year high of 1956%. The economy is expected to continue its recovery in Q4, 2020. Both manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMI, though below 500 level, showed growth in December 2020. Both employment and output rose in Q4, 2020, though employment continues to lag output recovery. The overall consumer optimism index for 2021 also rose in expectations of positive development in Q1, 2021. Disbursements under the Bank Intervention Funds continue to progress well, limiting the shortfall in consumers incomes and providing support for small and medium scale entrepreneurs. Considerations Nigeria's current experience is not out of step with global trend. For most countries in 2"
Chile,2021-01-27,"Wednesday, 27 January 2021 Monetary Policy Meeting  January 2021 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50%. The Board also decided to adapt the Financing Facility Conditional on Increased Lending (FCIC). These decisions were adopted with the unanimous vote of the Board members. In the external scenario, the general outlook for 2021 remains unchanged, despite a somewhat weaker first quarter resulting from the worsened sanitary situation and reinstated tighter containment measures. The start of the vaccination process has been a positive development, especially for the sentiment of the financial markets, although the pace of implementation is varying greatly from one country to another. Global financial conditions remain favorable, in a context in which monetary stimuli are expected to remain in place for a long time, in addition to new fiscal measures, particularly in the United States. Thus, among other things, the increase in capital flows to emerging economies, worldwide improvements in stock markets and increases in commodity prices stand out, particularly the strong recovery of oil prices and the rise of the copper price to US$3.6 per pound. Local financial markets have, in general, aligned themselves with the more positive tone of their international peers. The IPSA's cumulative gains and the peso's appreciation with respect to its last year's average levels stand out. The latter has been largely influenced by the sustained recovery of copper prices. Meanwhile, interest rates in the fixed-income market have fallen for the various maturities, especially in the longer tranches. In the bank credit market, commercial loans have further slowed their pace of growth in annual terms. The mortgage portfolio, in turn, has maintained relatively stable growth, while the consumer portfolio continues to show a significant annual contraction, in a [INF*RES*AS] context where interest rates have remained low across all segments. The Bank Lending Survey of the fourth quarter revealed a reduction in companies' applications for investment and working capital funds, as well as a more restrictive supply, especially for SMEs. This coincides with an increase in the levels of financial burdens and risk perception. In response to this, the law to modify the Fogape credit lines --Fogape Reactiva-- was approved, aimed at adapting them to the current needs of companies. As for domestic activity, the November Imacec posted growth of 0.3% annually and 1.1% seasonally adjusted with respect to the previous month, thus continuing with the steady process of economic recovery. The dynamism of trade stood out in this result, contrasting with the lagging services sector. The labor market continued to recover in November, with growth in employment and wages, although there are still significant differences with pre- pandemic levels. Overall, the increase in contagions and the introduction of tighter sanitary restrictions since December have been reflected in the indicators of business and household expectations. The year 2020 ended with total annual inflation of 3% --3.3% in the core measure. December's monthly record of 0.3% was mainly explained by some high-demand goods which, amid slow inventory replenishment and increases in transportation costs, have continued to drive inflation most recently. By contrast, the services side remains rather weak. In the medium term, the gradual closing of the activity gap will continue to prevail, containing inflationary pressures at this horizon. Regarding market expectations, both one and two years ahead, the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) and the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) place them at 3% annually. The Board reiterates that it will maintain a highly expansionary monetary policy, combining an MPR at its 0.5% minimum with unconventional measures. In particular, the MPR will remain unchanged over most of the two-year monetary policy horizon and the Central Bank will maintain the reinvestment policy of the bank bond stock program announced in December. Regarding the FCIC, the Board agreed to open Phase 3 with an amount of US$10 billion in effect for six months. This new phase responds to the current financial needs of companies, complementing the recently approved Fogape-Reactiva program, especially in its refinancing line. In addition, it agreed to expand the eligible collateral for this stage, adding the A5- and A6-category commercial portfolio with government guarantee. The operational details and specific dates for the implementation of these measures will be announced in the coming days. The Board reiterates that any future changes in monetary policy or additional measures will depend on the evolution of the macroeconomic outlook, the proper functioning of financial markets and the fulfillment of the Bank's objectives regarding inflation and financial stability. [INF*RES*AS] The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Thursday, 11 February 2021. The next Monetary Policy Meeting is scheduled to take place on Tuesday, 30 March and the statement thereof will be released at 18:00 hours that same day. The Spanish original prevails."
United States,2021-01-27,"EST January 27, 2021 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The pace of the recovery in economic activity and employment has moderated in recent months, with weakness concentrated in the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic. Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices have been holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations. The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below this longer- run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its (more) For release at 2 p.m. EST January 27, 2021 - 2 - holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Colombia,2021-01-29,"Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). The decision was based on the following considerations. Banco de la Republica's board of directors (BDBR) in its meeting on January 29 held the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%. The decision was based on the following considerations. Annual inflation in 2020 was 1.6%, below the BDBR's 3.0% target. Indicators of core inflation averaged 1.3% for the year. Year-end inflation expectations remain stable at 2.7% for 2021 and 3.1% for 2022. Inflation is expected to remain low for the first quarter of 2021 before accelerating through the rest of the year. The most recent growth indicators confirm a recovery in economic activity that is expected to continue through the course of the year. The financial system continues to offer favorable and stable conditions for solvency and liquidity. In this context, the credit portfolio and interest rates continue to respond to monetary policy stimulus. External financial conditions continue to favor financing of the Colombian economy. Uncertainty persists regarding the economic effects of new waves of the coronavirus pandemic. In considering these circumstances and the general balance of risks, the BDBR voted 5-2 to hold the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%.

Armenia,2021-02-02,"PRESS RELEASE 02.02.2021 Refinancing rate raised by 0.25 percentage point - 5.5% At the February 2, 2021 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to raise the refinancing rate by 0.25 pp, setting it at 5.5%. Inflation in December 2020 amounted to 3.4%, mainly due to the rise in prices of imported food products, in which case the 12-month inflation has increased significantly and nearly approached the target level, reaching 3.7% at the end of the year. In December, the 12-month core inflation also increased, making up 3.6% at the end of the month. Early in 2021, in line with the scenario outlined in the monetary policy program of the CBA, signs of reviving economic activity and demand recovery are observed in the United States and Russia,among the key partner countries to Armenia. while trends in the Eurozone are slower than anticipated due to the restrictions imposed under the spreading pandemic. At the same time, driven by expectations of global demand recovery and influenced by a number of supply factors, inflationary developments continue to persist in the global commodity and food markets, which is also reflected in the higher-than-expected inflationary environment in key partner countries. Under such circumstances, the CBA Board estimates that mostly inflationary impact on the Armenian economy from the external sector is persisting. Economic activity in the fourth quarter proved lower than expected in the context of the announced martial law in Armenia, the spread of coronavirus pandemic and high uncertainty over the economic growth outlooks. The economic downturn was largely due to the decline in the services sector, reflecting also weak demand. The projected slowdown in lending to the economy is predicted to have an additional negative impact on domestic demand. Along with these developments, in recent months there has been some improvement in the country's risk premium estimates in the international financial markets. Nonetheless, the Board is of the opinion that, in the current situation, it is important to implement potential growth-enhancing structural reforms, including trough the adoption of an appropriate fiscal spending strategy. Despite a sluggish demand and primarily a supply-side driven inflation, there is some acceleration in inflation expectations as a result of the latter, and the CBA Board therefore considers it appropriate toincrease the refinancing rate. The Board will also stay committed in taking appropriate actions to neutralize any risks of inflation expectations destabilization. Under such conditions, inflation in the forecast horizon will be around the 4% target. The CBA Board finds that the risks of inflation deviating from mid-term projection path amid high uncertainty over economic outlooks are balanced, and should they emerge, the Central Bank stands ready to react accordingly, in fulfilment of the goal of price stability. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by February 16, 2021."
Georgia,2021-02-03,"03.02.2021 The National Bank of Georgia keeps its policy rate unchanged at 8.0 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on February 3, 2021, and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 8.0 percent. Annual inflation stood at 2.8 percent in January. The reduction of inflation over the last two months is related to the government subsidy of utility fees and is of a temporary nature. Generally, central banks do not react to temporary deviations of inflation due to such exogenous factors and are guided by the medium-term inflation forecast. According to the current forecast, other things equal, inflation will remain on average around 4 percent in 2021 and then gradually approach the target. Compared to the previous forecast, a significant increase in prices in international commodity markets is notable among the factors affecting the dynamics of inflation, which was especially prominent in January. Moreover, upward pressure on inflation persists due to rising production costs stemming from prolongation of pandemic-related restrictions and depriciated exchange rate. The latter, in turn, increases imported inflation and intermediate costs. On the other hand, it should be noted that, despite relatively strong domestic demand, due to the sharp decline in external demand, aggregate demand is still weak. However, the downward impact of weak aggregate demand on forecasted inflation is weakened by the depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate, while the high dollarization of the economy fortifies the transmission of exchange rate fluctuations to inflation. On the other hand, it should be noted that the termination of the partial subsidy of interest expenses on mortgage loans, in fact, has an effect similar to the tightening of monetary policy. The Committee also noted that uncertainty remains high about both the dynamics of the recovery of global economic activity and the growth rate of local lending. Taking into account the abovementioned factors, the need to maintain a tight monetary stance was apparent. However, the committee does not rule out an increase in the policy rate in the future either. According to preliminary data, aggregate demand is weak. Based on rapid estimates, economic activity fell by 7.9 percent year-on-year in December, while the twelve-month average is -6.1 percent. After the decline in 2020, a gradual recovery of economic activity is expected in 2021. According to current forecasts, other things equal, economic growth in 2021 is expected to be around 4 percent and its main driver would be domestic demand. In contrast, external demand will remain considerably reduced and only marginal growth is projected in 2021. As for the current indicators, the revenues from international travelers is minimal and, according to preliminary data, decreased by 93 percent year-on- year in December. Amid weak aggregate demand and depreciated exchange rate, imports of goods fell by18 percent year-on-year in December, while exports of goods also fell by 18 percent. The NBG continuesly monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on March 17, 2021."
Poland,2021-02-03,"Warsaw, 3 February 2021 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 3 February 2021 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 0.10%; lombard rate at 0.50%; deposit rate at 0.00%; rediscount rate at 0.11%; discount rate at 0.12%. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. The timing and scale of the conducted measures will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. As COVID-19 infections increased and the sanitary restrictions were tightened again, the global recovery slowed down in 2020 Q4. According to preliminary data. GDP fell in the euro area in that period. In January 2021  faced with the risk of another wave of infections  some European countries extended or tightened the existing pandemic restrictions. As a result, the services sector continues to see a downturn amid a relatively better situation in industry. Inflation in the global economy remains low. The major central banks are keeping interest rates low and conducting asset purchases. Growing concerns about the inability to swiftly halt the pandemic despite the start of the vaccinations has negatively affected global financial market sentiment over the recent past. At the same time, expectations about the additional fiscal stimulus in the United States have supported asset prices in the financial markets. Since the beginning of the year, the prices of some commodities, including oil, have increased in the global markets. In Poland, the rise in the number of COVID-19 infections and the tightening of the pandemic restrictions in 2020 Q4 had a negative impact on economic activity in that period, in particular in some parts of the service sector. December saw an increase in the growth rate of construction and assembly production and in industrial production, including in exporting sectors. The current estimates, taking into account the preliminary estimate of GDP in 2020, indicate that 2020 Q4 saw another decline in GDP, although considerably smaller than that in 2020 Q2. The economic downturn was driven, in particular, by lower consumption with investment remaining weaker than a year before. The labour market data for December point to average employment in the enterprise sector still lower than a year ago amid rising annual growth of average wages in this sector. At the same time, inflation at the end of 2020 declined to 2.4% y/y. It can be expected that following the fall in GDP in 2020, economic activity will increase in 2021, although the scale of the recovery will mainly depend on the epidemiological situation and the related restrictions. The further course of the pandemic and its impact on the economic situation in Poland and abroad remain the main sources of uncertainty for the economic outlook in Poland. The economic policy measures, including the easing of NBP's monetary policy, will have a positive impact on the economic situation. However, growth in economic activity may be limited by the heightened uncertainty and the weaker sentiment of economic agents than before the pandemic, which will result in a significant slowdown in investment growth. The pace of economic recovery may also be reduced by the lack of a visible and more durable zloty exchange rate adjustment to the global pandemic shock and to the monetary policy easing introduced by NBP. These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in the secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In order to strengthen the impact of NBP's monetary policy easing on the economy. NBP may also intervene in the foreign exchange market. The timing and scale of the measures taken by NBP will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also continue to offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. NBP's monetary policy mitigates the negative economic impact of the pandemic, supports economic activity and stabilises inflation at the level consistent with NBP's medium-term inflation target. Due to its positive impact on the financial situation of debtors, it is also conducive to the strengthening of financial system stability."
Thailand,2021-02-03,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 1/2021 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 3 February 2021 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent to support the economic recovery which remained highly uncertain. The Committee assessed that, while the new wave of the COVID-19 outbreak and the containment measures would affect the Thai economy in the short term, the economic recovery continued to be on track thanks to government measures and export recovery. Nevertheless uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook remained high with considerable downside risks. The economy would thus need support from the continued low policy rate. The Committee therefore voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting to preserve the limited policy space to act at the appropriate and most effective timing. The Committee assessed that the impact of the recent outbreak on the Thai economy would be less severe than last year due to less strict containment measures. Additional support from the timely and targeted government measures together with the export recovery would support economic growth. The Committee thus expected the economy to expand somewhat lower than the previous forecast. Nonetheless the recovery prospect remained highly uncertain, which would in the short term depend mainly on the situation of the new wave of the COVID-19 outbreak and corresponding containment measures. At a longer horizon, it would depend on the recovery in foreign tourist figures, efficacy and coverage of COVID-19 vaccination, continued and sufficient fiscal support, and the labor market situation, which became more fragile as the numbers of unemployed and underemployed workers were expected to rise in the short term. Furthermore recoveries across economic sectors were likely to be more uneven which would affect the sustainability of the economic growth going forward. The financial system remained sound despite increasing vulnerabilities in some segments due to the negative shocks from the recent outbreak. In particular, low-income households and SMEs became more vulnerable. Headline inflation was projected to return to the target in the middle of 2021 and would stay close to the lower bound of the target range throughout the forecast period. Medium- term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target. Despite ample overall liquidity and low financing costs, the distribution of liquidity remained uneven due to increased credit risks. This was a result of more fragile financial positions, particularly for businesses that experienced slow recovery and households that were additionally affected by the recent outbreak. The movement of the baht against the US dollar was in line with regional currencies. The Committee would closely monitor developments of the baht, consider the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures, and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem. The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery going forward. Monetary policy must remain accommodative. Financial and credit measures should expedite liquidity distribution to the affected groups in a targeted and timely manner, for instance, through credit guarantee schemes in order to curb credit risks, while financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring to have a broader impact. Other additional measures should also be considered to increase the effectiveness of liquidity distribution and to support the economic recovery going forward. Fiscal measures must continue to sustain the economy. In particular, the government should expedite budget disbursement under the restoration plan once the new wave of the outbreak become well contained. Besides the government should simultaneously implement supply-side policies to support business restructuring and upskilling of labor, which would help support sustainable economic recovery in the long term. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to emphasize supporting the economic recovery. The Committee would monitor the adequacy of the government measures and various risks, especially the outbreak situation in Thailand and abroad, in deliberating monetary policy going forward. The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary."
Czech Republic,2021-02-04,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank unanimously kept interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 0.25%, the discount rate at 0.05% and the Lombard rate at 1%.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates initially, followed by a gradual rise in rates from roughly the middle of this year onwards. The current economic situation and the economic outlook are still being fundamentally affected by the course of the coronavirus pandemic and the anti-pandemic measures in the Czech Republic and abroad. The government measures in place in our trading partner countries during the current wave of the pandemic are having milder economic impacts than in spring 2020. The decline in foreign economic activity at the turn of the year is being softened by solid performance of industry. However, the existing restrictions will only be lifted very gradually. Nevertheless, euro area real GDP growth can be expected to resume this year. Foreign industrial prices will also return to growth in 2020. That growth, however, will be dampened by only gradual closure of the output gap and appreciation of the euro against the dollar. Consumer price inflation in the euro area will reflect rising energy prices and increasing indirect taxes this year. Before the end of 2020, the European Central Bank responded to the economic downturn caused by the second wave of the pandemic by easing monetary policy further. The outlook for euro interest rates is therefore negative over the entire forecast horizon. The price of Brent crude oil rose to more than USD 50 a barrel at the turn of the year. The market outlook expects it to decline slightly again this year and the next. The forecast also assumes further appreciation of the euro against the dollar. As regards the domestic economy, the deterioration of the epidemic situation in autumn and winter led to repeated shutdowns. According to the assumptions of the forecast, they will be relaxed only gradually during the first half of this year. The restrictions mainly concern wholesale and retail and services. By contrast, export-oriented industry has been hit to only a small extent so far, unlike during the first wave. The forecast assumes that the adverse economic impacts of the pandemic will gradually fade during the year as the epidemic situation improves. Economic growth will therefore resume in the second quarter, aided by gradually improving household and corporate sentiment. The economy will grow by more than 2% overall this year. It will pick up further next year, fostering a gradual return of overall economic activity to the pre-pandemic level. At the end of last year, inflation returned to the tolerance band around the Czech National Bank's target. It will fall further close to the 2% target in the first quarter of this year and fluctuate around the target for the rest of this year. The current decline in inflation is due to a slowdown of the previously strong growth in food prices and administered prices. Core inflation will also decline in the first half of the year, reflecting a continued weakening of growth in total costs. The disinflationary effect of the domestic economy will subsequently fade steadily as the economy gradually recovers from the pandemic. However, continued appreciation of the koruna will act in the opposite direction. Headline inflation will get slightly above the inflation target next year, owing mainly to an increase in excise duties. Monetary policy-relevant inflation, which looks past the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, will stabilise at the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon. The koruna will appreciate gradually further according to the forecast. This will reflect the resilience of Czech export-oriented industry during the second wave of the pandemic, the subsequent reopening of the economy and improved financial market sentiment. A strengthening koruna will also be fostered by a gradually widening positive interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates initially, followed by a gradual rise in rates from roughly the middle of this year onwards. The initial rate stability reflects the need to keep monetary policy easy in a situation where the pandemic is having negative impacts on the domestic economy. The subsequent gradual rise in rates stems from the expected recovery of the domestic and foreign economy as the pandemic recedes with inflation stabilised close to the target. By comparison with the previous forecast, the inflation outlook is lower for this year and higher for next year. Economic growth has been revised upwards for 2021 and downwards for 2022. The outlook for domestic interest rates is little changed. The koruna-euro exchange rate is expected to be visibly stronger than in the previous forecast both this year and the next. The Bank Board assessed the uncertainties and risks of the forecast as being substantial and tilted to a longer-lasting pandemic than assumed by the forecast. Longer lockdowns at home and abroad and an ensuing deterioration in the financial situation and sentiment of businesses and households are the main risk to the forecast. This could lead to a lengthier cyclical downturn of the Czech economy and hence to a need to keep monetary conditions accommodative for longer than in the forecast."
Egypt,2021-02-04,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release February 4th, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 825 percent, 925 percent, and 875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 875 percen. Annual headline urban inflation decelerated to 54 percent in December 2020 from 57 percent in November 202. The decline in annual headline inflation was mainly driven by lower prices of fresh vegetables, reflecting their seasonal pattern as well as the partial reversal of the transitory shock in tomato price. In the meantime, annual core inflation decelerated to 38 percent in December 2020 from 40 percent in November 202. Accordingly annual headline urban inflation registered an average of 52 percent during 2020 Q4, coming below the lower target band of 6 percent previously announced in 201. The deviation from the target was a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and its resulting government containment measures on economic activit. Furthermore the government's successful implementation of several measures to avoid supply shortages in the market contributed to lower inflation rate. Nonetheless given the balance of risks, the CBE undertook several preemptive measures to support economic activity while remaining consistent with achieving its price stability objective over the medium ter. Real GDP growth recorded a preliminary figure of 07 percent during 2020 Q3, up from -17 percent during 2020 Q2. Meanwhile, select demand-side leading indicators continue to display signs of recovery in 2020 Q. Moreover the unemployment rate decreased to 73 percent in 2020 Q3, down from 96 percent in 2020 Q. Globally economic activity remains subdued despite the accommodative financial conditions, as the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its subsequent containment measures continue to weigh on the near- term outloo. On the other hand, the path to global economic recovery remains a function of the efficacy, availability and the rollout speed of vaccines, which could ease the level of uncertainty regarding economic activity over the medium ter. Meanwhile international oil prices have continued to pick up largely due to supply side development. Against this background, the MPC decided that keeping policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 7 percent (Â±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandat.

India,2021-02-05,"Monetary Policy Statement, 2020-21 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) February 3-5, 2021 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (February 5, 2021) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary  at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year  to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID- 19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. The global economic recovery slackened in Q4 (October-December) of 2020 relative to Q3 (July-September) as several countries battle second waves of COVID- 19 infections, including more virulent strains. With massive vaccination drives underway, risks to the recovery may abate and economic activity is expected to gain momentum in the second half of 2021. In its January 2021 update, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised upward its estimate of global growth in 2020 to (-)3.5 per cent from (-)4.4 per cent and increased the projection of global growth for 2021 by 30 basis points to 5.5 per cent. Barring some emerging market economies, inflation remains benign on weak aggregate demand, although rising commodity prices carry upside risks. Financial markets remain buoyant, supported by easy monetary conditions, abundant liquidity and optimism from the vaccine rollout. Global trade is also expected to rebound in 2021, with services trade on a slower recovery than merchandise trade.2 Domestic Economy 3. The first advance estimates of GDP for 2020-21 released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on January 7, 2021 estimated real GDP to contract by 7.7 per cent, in line with the projection of (-)7.5 per cent set out in the December 2020 resolution of the MPC. High frequency indicators  railway freight traffic; toll collection; e-way bills; and steel consumption  suggest that revival of some constituents of the services sector gained traction in Q3 (October-December). The agriculture sector remains resilient - rabi sowing was higher by 2.9 per cent year-on- year (y-o-y) as on January 29, 2021, supported by above normal north-east monsoon rainfall and adequate reservoir level of 61 per cent (as on February 4, 2021) of full capacity, above the 10 years average of 50 per cent. After breaching the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent for six consecutive months (June-November 2020). CPI inflation fell to 4.6 per cent in December on the back of easing food prices and favourable base effects. Food inflation collapsed to 3.9 per cent in December after averaging 9.6 per cent during the previous three months (September-November) due to a sharp correction in vegetable prices and softening of cereal prices with kharif harvest arrivals, alongside supply side interventions. On the other hand, core inflation, i.e. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained elevated at 5.5 per cent in December with marginal moderation from a month ago. In the January 2021 round of the Reserve Bank's survey, inflation expectations of households softened further over a three month ahead horizon in tandem with the moderation in food inflation; one year ahead inflation expectations, however, remained unchanged. Systemic liquidity remained in large surplus in December 2020 and January 2021, engendering easy financial conditions. Reserve money rose by 14.5 per cent y- o-y (on January 29, 2021), led by currency demand. Money supply (M ), on the other 3 hand, grew by only 12.5 per cent as on January 15, 2021, but with non-food credit growth of scheduled commercial banks accelerating to 6.4 per cent. Corporate bond issuances at â¹5.8 lakh crore during April-December 2020 were higher than â¹4.6 lakh crore in the same period of last year. India's foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 590.2 billion on January 29, 2021  an increase of US$ 112.4 billion over end-March 2020. Outlook 6. With the larger than anticipated deflation in vegetable prices in December bringing down headline closer to the target, it is likely that the food inflation trajectory will shape the near-term outlook. The bumper kharif crop, rising prospects of a good rabi harvest, larger winter arrivals of key vegetables and softer egg and poultry demand on avian flu fears are factors auguring a benign inflation outcome in the months ahead. On the other hand, price pressures may persist in respect of pulses, edible oils, spices and non-alcoholic beverages. The outlook for core inflation is likely to be impacted by further easing in supply chains; however, broad-based escalation in cost-push pressures in services and manufacturing prices due to increase in industrial raw material prices could impart upward pressure. Furthermore, there could be increased pass-through to output prices as demand normalises as indicated in the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook, services and infrastructure outlook surveys and purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) and firms regain pricing power. International crude oil prices may remain supported by demand build up on optimism from vaccination and continuing production cuts by OPEC plus. The crude oil futures curve has become downward sloping since December 2020. Taking into consideration all3 these factors, the projection for CPI inflation has been revised to 5.2 per cent in Q4:2020-21, 5.2 per cent to 5.0 per cent in H1:2021-22 and 4.3 per cent in Q3: 2021- 22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1). Turning to the growth outlook, rural demand is likely to remain resilient on good prospects of agriculture. Urban demand and demand for contact-intensive services is expected to strengthen with the substantial fall in COVID-19 cases and the spread of vaccination. Consumer confidence is reviving and business expectations of manufacturing, services and infrastructure remain upbeat. The fiscal stimulus under AtmaNirbhar 2.0 and 3.0 schemes of government will likely accelerate public investment, although private investment remains sluggish amidst still low capacity utilisation. The Union Budget 2021-22, with its thrust on sectors such as health and well-being, infrastructure, innovation and research, among others, should help accelerate the growth momentum. Taking these factors into consideration, real GDP growth is projected at 10.5 per cent in 2021-22  in the range of 26.2 to 8.3 per cent in H1 and 6.0 per cent in Q3 (Chart 2). The MPC notes that the sharp correction in food prices has improved the food price outlook, but some pressures persist, and core inflation remains elevated. Pump prices of petrol and diesel have reached historical highs. An unwinding of taxes on petroleum products by both the centre and the states could ease the cost push pressures. What is needed at this point is to create conditions that result in a durable disinflation. This is contingent also on proactive supply side measures. Growth is recovering, and the outlook has improved significantly with the rollout of the vaccine programme in the country. The Union Budget 2021-22 has introduced several measures to provide an impetus to growth. The projected increase in capital expenditure augurs well for capacity creation thereby improving the prospects for growth and building credibility around the quality of expenditure. The recovery, however, is still to gather firm traction and hence continued policy support is crucial. Taking these developments into consideration, the MPC in its meeting today decided to continue with an accommodative stance of monetary policy till the prospects of a sustained recovery are well secured while closely monitoring the evolving outlook for inflation.4 9. All members of the MPC  Dr.Shashanka Bhide; Dr.Ashima Goyal; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma; Dr.Mridul K.

Philippines,2021-02-10,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility at 2.0 percent. The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were likewise kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. The Monetary Board noted that inflation is likely to remain elevated in the coming months, reflecting the impact of supply constraints on domestic prices of key food commodities such as meat and vegetables as well as the recent uptick in international oil prices. At the same time, the latest baseline projections show inflation returning to within the target range of 2-4 percent over the policy horizon as supply-side influences subside. The Monetary Board also noted that inflation expectations continue to be anchored within the inflation target band. The balance of risks to the inflation outlook now appears to be broadly balanced around the baseline path in 2021 but is seen to continue leaning toward the downside in 2022. Tighter supply of meat products owing in part to the African Swine Fever outbreak in the country could lend further upside pressures on inflation. However, the ongoing pandemic may continue to pose downside risks to demand and to the inflation outlook. While recent indicators of activity and sentiment have shown some improvement, the emergence of new variants of the virus and possible delays in mass vaccination programs continue to temper prospects for economic recovery and growth. On balance, the Monetary Board is of the view that the manageable inflation outlook continues to allow the BSP to maintain an accommodative policy stance and thus complement crucial fiscal policy measures in supporting economic activity and market confidence. The Monetary Board likewise reiterates its support for urgent and coordinated efforts with government agencies in implementing non-monetary interventions to enable all Filipinos access to internationally competitively priced food and thereby mitigate the impact of supply-side factors on inflation. Looking ahead, the BSP remains firm in its intent to take appropriate measures to ensure that the monetary policy stance continues to support the recovery of the economy, consistent with its price and financial stability mandate."
Armenia,2021-02-11,"PRESS RELEASE 02.11.2021 At the November 2, 2021 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at 7.25%. Inflation in September 2021 stood at -0.1%, compared to -0.2% inflation in the same month of the previous year. As a result, the 12-month inflation remained unchanged at 8.9%. In September, the 12- month core inflation remained stable at 8.0%. Despite the rapid spread of the new type of coronavirus worldwide, recovery of economic activity and aggregate demand continues in the main partner countries of Armenia thanks to the rapid vaccination rollout and the effort to avoid strict healthcare measures. Positive demand developments, in an environment of constrained supply conditions, have caused significant inflationary pressures in the international commodity and food markets, which is also reflected in accelerating inflation in partner countries. Under these conditions, inflationary pressures on the Armenian economy from the external sector persist. Current developments in the Armenian economy point to somewhat weaker-than-expected economic activity, primarily due to the decline in the agricultural sector and the expected slowdown in the services sector caused by the new wave of the pandemic. Nevertheless, demand continues its recovery, primarily owing to private consumption, on the back of large inflow of remittances and declining private savings rate. The CBA Board judges that the outpacing growth of private consumption over the expansion of production capacities continues to contribute to the domestic inflationary environment. At the same time, public's inflation expectations tend to show signs of stabilization. Despite the persisting inflationary environment in the external sector and the Armenian economy, the CBA Board assesses that the forward-looking and consistent tightening of monetary conditions since the end of last year is having sufficient impact to control the outpacing demand, contain the inflation and ensure fulfillment of the target in the medium term. The Board, therefore, judges appropriate to leave the refinancing rate unchanged. The 12-month inflation is projected to remain high until the end of the year, and then to approach the 4% target in 2022, stabilizing around it in the medium term. The Board assesses that the risks of inflation deviating from the projected medium term path are balanced, and should they materialize, the Board will stand ready to respond accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective. Detailed information about setting the interest rate level will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by November 16, 2021.

Mexico,2021-02-11,"Since December, the Mexican peso and interest rates have fluctuated in a narrow range. Economic activity in Mexico improved during the fourth quarter at a slightly higher-than-foreseen rate, although it remains below the levels prior to the pandemic, in an uncertain environment with downward risks. Ample slack conditions are expected throughout the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Annual headline inflation decreased from 4.09% in October, its highest level in 2020, to 3.54% in January 2021, while core inflation declined from 3.98% to 3.84%. The pandemic has implied significant changes in relative prices, which have exerted upward pressures on merchandise inflation and downward pressures on services inflation, which registered 5.41% and 2.13%, respectively, in January. Headline inflation expectations for the end of 2021 were adjusted slightly upwards and those for the medium and long terms remained stable at levels above the 3% target. The expected paths for headline and core inflation within the forecast horizon are similar to those foreseen in the last Quarterly Report. Increases in headline inflation are anticipated during the second quarter of the year, mainly associated with the arithmetical effects of the fall in energy prices of last year, and a downward trajectory starting in the second half of the year. Core inflation is expected to be around 3% as of the third quarter of this year. These forecasts are subject to short- and medium-term risks. To the downside: a greater-than-expected effect due to the negative output gap or to greater social distancing measures; lower inflationary pressures worldwide; and foreign exchange appreciation. To the upside: core inflation pressures generated by the recomposition of spending; episodes of foreign exchange depreciation; and various cost-related pressures for firms. The balance of risks for the projected trajectory of inflation is uncertain. The risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets pose major challenges for monetary policy and for the economy. In this regard, it is necessary to enable an orderly adjustment that allows for a change in relative prices, without affecting the price formation process and inflation expectations. Considering that incoming information allows for a monetary policy adjustment, while maintaining inflation forecasts in line with the converging trajectory to the 3% target, with the presence of all its members, the Governing Board decided unanimously to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to a level of 4.00%. Looking ahead, monetary policy implementation will depend on the 1 evolution of the factors that have an incidence on headline and core inflation, on their foreseen trajectories within the forecast horizon, and on their expectations. The Governing Board will take the necessary actions based on incoming information in order for the policy rate to be consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. It is necessary to safeguard the institutional framework, strengthen the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopt the necessary actions on both monetary and fiscal policy fronts, to enable a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole."
Peru,2021-02-11,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT FEBRUARY 2021 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation increased from 2.0 percent in December to 2.7 percent in January due to specific supply factors that led to higher prices of some goods and energy. Trend inflation remains in the lower part of the target range. Thus, year-on- year core inflation was 1.7 percent in January at the center of the target. Inflation is expected to remain within the target range throughout 2021 and 2022; and to lie at the lower part of the range by the end of the year, as economic activity will remain below its potential level over the forecast horizon (2021-2022). One-year ahead expected inflation was 2.0 percent in January. The recovery of leading indicators moderated in January. Firms' growth expectations deteriorated in January, considering the intensified impact of the pandemic on the economy due to the beginning of a second wave of contagions and the new restriction measures. Global economic activity has been improving, but at a more moderate pace due to social confinement measures in the face of the new pandemic outbreak. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows, and stands ready to expand monetary stimulus using a range of instruments. As of February 10. BCRP injection operations totaled S/ 64,566 million, of which S/ 50,364 million were associated with government- backed repos. S/ 1,097 million with repos conditioned to credits rescheduling, and S/ 245 million with repos conditioned to the expansion of long-term credit. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on March 11, 2021."
Russia,2021-02-12,"On 12 February 2021, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 4.25% per annum. In December and January, prices continued to grow at an elevated pace. Demand is recovering faster and more sustainably than expected. At the same time, supply-side restrictions are still in place and continue to exert upward pressure on prices. Inflation expectations of households and businesses remain elevated. Accelerated vaccination rates, as well as expectations of additional fiscal support measures in certain countries, contribute to the growth of prices in financial and commodity markets. In this context, disinflationary risks no longer prevail over a one-year horizon, and the Bank of Russia has increased its 2021 inflation forecast to 3.74.2%. Moving forward, given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will stay close to 4%. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will determine the timeline and pace of a return to neutral monetary policy taking into account the still high heterogeneity of current economic and price movement trends, actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target, economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics. Inflation is developing above the Bank of Russia's forecast. In January, the annual consumer price growth rate rose to 5.2% vs 4.9% in December. This is largely related to the growth in prices in global commodity markets and the continuing pass-through of the ruble's earlier weakening to prices. These factors may exert more prolonged influence due to the previous growth in households' and businesses' inflation expectations and remaining supply-side restrictions. Government measures constrained the growth of prices for certain goods. According to Bank of Russia estimates, current consumer inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are close to 4% (annualised). Inflation expectations of households have abated; however, they still remain elevated compared to the pre-pandemic period. This is largely related to the increase in prices for certain everyday goods and exchange rate volatility. Inflation expectations of businesses have not changed materially after growing over previous months. Analysts' inflation expectations for 2021 and the medium term are anchored close to 4%. The restraining influence of domestic demand on price movements is weakening amid continuing inflationary pressure of enterprise costs. Such supply-side proinflationary factors as a labour force shortage in certain spheres and additional costs of businesses to comply with anti-epidemic requirements are becoming more noticeable. If these factors continue to exert their influence over the coming quarters, inflation might return to the Bank of Russia's target slower than expected. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, annual inflation will peak in February-March and decline later on. The path of this decline will be determined by the timing of exhaustion of the effect of proinflationary factors and 2020 base effects. The baseline scenario assumes that, given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reach 3.74.2% in 2021 and remain close to 4% later on. Monetary conditions remain accommodative and have not changed substantially since the previous meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors. OFZ yields grew somewhat amid rising inflation expectations, climbing long-term interest rates in global financial markets, and remaining geopolitical tensions. Accelerated vaccination rates, as well as expectations of additional fiscal support measures in certain countries, contribute to the growth of prices in financial and commodity markets. Loan and deposit rates mainly remained unchanged. At the same time, higher price growth and inflation expectations over recent months mean that price lending conditions have slightly eased in real terms. In certain segments, banks continued to ease non-price lending conditions as well. In this context lending expansion continued. Alongside with accommodative monetary conditions, lending dynamics are influenced by the preferential programmes implemented by the Government as well as by regulatory relaxations. When making its key rate decisions, the Bank of Russia will assess the impact of cancelling these anti-crisis measures on monetary conditions. Economic activity. This is less than the Bank of Russia expected earlier. According to the Bank of Russia's estimates, economic recovery also continued in 2020 Q4. The constraining effect of the worsening epidemic situation on the economy in Russia and worldwide was much less than expected. This is related to the targeted nature of restrictive measures and the significant adaptation of households and businesses to the new conditions. In 2020 Q4, households' real income continued to recover and unemployment started to decline. High-frequency indicators of economic activity suggest that the economic recovery in early 2021 is ongoing. The paces of recovery are set to gain support from better consumer and business sentiment in the context of partially lifted restrictive measures and coronavirus vaccination coverage. The Bank of Russia forecasts the recovery growth of the Russian economy in 2021 in the range of 3.04.0%. However, the scale of this recovery will continue to vary markedly across sectors. According to the Bank of Russia forecast. GDP in 20222023 is set to grow 2.53.5% and 2.03.0% respectively. The medium-term economic growth path will be largely influenced by further coronavirus pandemic developments in Russia and globally, the nature of the recovery of private demand in the context of potential change in consumer and business behaviour, as well as by the path of budget consolidation. Accommodative monetary policy will continue to support the economy throughout 2021. Inflation risks. Disinflationary risks no longer prevail over the horizon of 2021. The impact of proinflationary factors may prove more protracted and pronounced against the backdrop of a faster recovery in demand as well as previous growth in inflation expectations and the associated secondary effects. Upward pressure on prices may be caused by temporary disruptions in production and supply chains in the post-restriction period, as well as by additional corporate costs of protecting staff and consumers from the spread of the pandemic. Proinflationary risks are generated by domestic prices for certain food products, affected by supply-side factors and the environment in the related global markets. Short-term proinflationary risks are also connected with stronger volatility in global markets, driven by various geopolitical developments, among other factors, which may have an effect on exchange rate and inflation expectations. Also, given that the global economic recovery is progressing at faster paces than previously expected and the need is no longer in place for unprecedentedly accommodative policies in advanced economies, an earlier monetary policy normalisation in these countries is possible. This may become a further driver of volatility growth in global financial markets. Disinflationary risks under the baseline scenario are chiefly grounded in a weaker recovery in demand in Russia and globally. The economic recovery may be slowed down by the spread of new coronavirus strains and lower than expected paces of vaccination, among other things, as well as a tightening of restrictive measures. Persistent changes in consumer preferences and behaviour, including a persistent higher propensity to save, and a slower recovery of household incomes might also exert a constraining influence on inflation. Opening up the borders concurrently with a gradual lifting of restrictions may lead to a recovery in the consumption of foreign services and weaken supply-side constraints in the labour market through inflows of foreign labour force. Uncertainty remains as to rather long-term structural effects of the coronavirus pandemic for the Russian and global economies, specifically, the scale of a decrease in the potential of the national economy. Potential global growth may also come under marked pressure from geopolitical factors including rising trade conflicts. The extent of the Russian economy's deviation from its potential, specifically in the consumer sector, is the core driver of medium-term inflation movements. Medium-term inflation is significantly impacted by fiscal policy. In its baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia proceeds from the parameters of the federal budget and the budgets of constituent territories reflected in the Guidelines for Fiscal. Tax and Customs and Tariff Policy for 2021 and the 2022-2023 Planning Period, as well as from the announced time frames for the completion of anti-crisis measures of the Government and the Bank of Russia. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will determine the timeline and pace of a return to neutral monetary policy taking into account the still high heterogeneity of current economic and price movement trends, actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target, economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting of 12 February 2021 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 19 March 2021. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. Statement by Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina in follow-up to Board of Directors meeting 12 February 2021.

Turkiye,2021-02-18,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 17 percent. Economic activity is on a strong course. While the downward effects of the pandemic-related restrictions on the economy have been limited, the slowdown in activity in services and related sectors and uncertainties surrounding the short-run outlook of these sectors prevail. The strengthening domestic demand, due to the cumulative effects of high credit growth during the pandemic, continues to have an adverse effect on the current account balance. Nevertheless, credit growth has started to slow down amid tighter financial conditions. Domestic demand conditions, cumulative cost effects, in particular the exchange rate effects, increasing international food and other commodity prices and high levels of inflation expectations continue to affect the pricing behavior and inflation outlook adversely. The decelerating impact of the strong monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is expected to become more significant; hence the effects of demand and cost factors on inflation are envisaged to wane gradually. On the other hand, the ongoing upward trend in international commodity prices, supply constraints intensifying in some sectors, and the adjustments in wage and administered prices maintain their importance for the medium-term inflation outlook. Accordingly, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively, taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, for an extended period until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability. In regard to the indicators pointing to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability, indicators for the underlying trend of inflation and pricing behavior, diffusion indices, demand and cost factors, and inflation expectations are monitored closely for their compatibility with the targets in the forecast horizon. Additional monetary tightening will be delivered if needed. The balance between the monetary policy rate and actual/expected inflation will be sustained decisively to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until permanent price stability and the 5 percent target are reached. Sustaining the tight monetary policy stance in such a manner, besides attaining permanent price stability, will foster macroeconomic and financial stability positively by facilitating the fall in country risk premium, the reversal in currency substitution, the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs. In its decision-making process, the CBRT adopts a framework with a medium term perspective, based on analyzing all factors affecting inflation and the interaction between these factors. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2021-02-22,"The economy is in the process of exiting the third lockdown, which, despite its duration, was less strict than the previous lockdowns and had a more moderate than expected impact on economic activity. The vaccination campaign is progressing rapidly but the spread of more contagious variants and the still high morbidity level are weighing on a return to strong economic activity. GDP contracted by 2.4 percent in 2020, and per capita GDP contracted by 4.1 percent, less severe than had been previously forecasted.Despite the second lockdown in October and the start of the third lockdown at the end of December, in the fourth quarter of 2020 GDP grew by 6.3 percent (2.9 percent net of the effect of vehicle imports). Central Bureau of Statistics real-time surveys conducted in early January indicate an encouraging increase in the share of companies that believe they can continue to exist under the current conditions for more than half a year, with firms' resilience increasing the larger they are. The broad unemployment rate increased during the third lockdown, to about 20 percent in the second half of January, after having declined to about 13 percent during the period between the lockdowns. It is clear that the unemployment rate during the lockdowns increases mainly in the industries that are significantly impacted by social distancing requirements, such as the hospitality and food services, art and leisure, and education industries. The inflation environment remains low but continues to trend upward moderately. The CPI for January declined by 0.1 percent, following an identical decline in December, and the inflation rate in the past 12 monthswas -0.4 percent. In view of the accommodative monetary policy and the global inflation environment, inflation expectations for the coming year from all sources increased, and are around the lower bound of the target range. Expectations derived from the capital market for the first and second years increased markedly. The expectations for medium and long terms remain anchored within the target range. From the previous interest rate decision until January 14, the shekel strengthened by 3.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Following the Bank of Israel's announcement on that date regarding the amount of intervention to be executed in 2021, the shekel weakened by 5.2 percent. This trend is expected to support export performance during the exit from the crisis, and a return of inflation to the target range. The Israeli equitymarket showed large price increases relative to markets abroad. The credit market continues to function with stable and low interest rates, supported by a range of steps taken by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance. However, according to the Business Tendency Survey, the difficulty in raising bank credit reported by companies: particularly small ones: is still greater than it was prior to the crisis. The global economycontinues to recover against the background of the decline in the scope of morbidity around the world. The IMF revised its growth forecasts upward, with the global economy expected to grow by 5.5 percent in 2021. Fourth quarter GDP data surprised to the upside in most countries. However, morbidity levels that remained high in some countries, as well as the difficulty in moving forward with vaccinations, are expected to slow the pace of recovery. Thefast pace of the inoculation process in Israel increases the optimism regarding a rapid return of the economy to a path of growth in the coming year. However, the risks to economic activity remain high: mainly in view of the risk of additional morbidity waves due to the spread of the various mutations: and the adverse impact on the economy, and particularly on the labor market, is expected to be prolonged. The Committee will therefore continue to utilize a range of tools in order to increase the extent of the monetary policy accommodation and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. The Committee will expand the use of the existing tools, includingthe interest rate tool, and will operate additional ones, to the extent that it assesses that it is necessary in order to achieve its monetary policy goalsand to moderate the adverse economic impact resulting from the crisis. Forthe file of figures accompanying this notice, click here. The economy is in the process of exiting the third lockdown that began at the end of 2020 and continued until the first week of February. This lockdown was the longest of the lockdowns thus far, but despite its duration, it was less stringent and its impact on economic activity was more moderate than expected and less than the previous lockdowns. The inoculation campaign is progressing rapidly and the vaccination rate of the population in Israel isthe highest in the world. In contrast, the spread of more contagious variants and the high morbidity level are weighing on a return to enhanced economic activity. The available indicators regarding economic activity in December and January show a more moderate adverse impact to economic activity than during the previous lockdowns. However, there continues to be a marked variance in the impact between different industries, with some suffering anegative impact from the restrictions and social distancing requirements, in contrast to others that were not negatively impacted or that were able to adapt. This is seen, for example, in credit card expenditure data by industry (Figure 5). Google data on mobility to workplaces (Figure 6) declined at a slower rate than in previous lockdowns. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, the overall net balance of the business sector continues to increase slowly from the low point during the second lockdown (Figure 3). Foreign trade data indicate that goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds, in dollars) declined slightly in December and January, but remain similar to their precrisis levels. Goods imports (excluding ships, aircraft and diamonds in dollars) are in a significant upward trend that encompasses all components of imports. According to the first reading of National Accounts data for the fourth quarter. GDP contracted by 2.4 percent in 2020, and per capita GDP contracted by 4.1 percent, less than the contraction that had been forecast. Despite the second lockdown in October and the start of the third lockdown at the end of December. GDP grew by 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 (seasonally adjusted, in annual terms. Figure 1). Fourth-quarter growth was markedly affected by vehicle imports being brought forward in view of expected changes in taxation. Net of this component, based on the Research Department's assessment, fourth quarter growth was 2.9 percent. However, over the year as a whole, the volatility of vehicle imports (which occurred at the end of the previous year as well) did not have a significant impact on annual growth. Private consumption increased by about 18 percent in the fourth quarter, although over the year as a whole it contracted by more than 9 percent and constitutes the most notable contribution to the contraction of economic activity in 2020 <b> (Figure 2). Although the contraction of GDP was lower than expected: 2.4 percent in 2020: labor market data reflect the real magnitude of the crisis, and the uneven distribution of its impact on various wage levels. The broad unemployment rate increased during the third lockdown, to about 20 percent in the second half of January, after having declined to about 13 percent in the period between the lockdowns (Figure 9). An industry-by-industry examination shows that the unemployment rate during lockdowns increases in the industries that are notably impacted by social distancing requirements, particularly the hospitality and food services, art and leisure, and education industries (Figure 10). Real-time surveys conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics in early January indicate an encouraging increase in the share of companies that are of the view that they can continue to exist under the current conditions for more than half a year, with firms' resilience increasing the larger they are. The inflation environment remains low but continues to trend moderately upward. The CPI for January declined by 0.1 percent, following an identical rate of decline in December, and inflation in the past 12 months was -0.4 percent (0.1 percent net of energy and fruit and vegetables) (Figure 12). Against the background of the accommodative policy and the global inflation environment, inflation expectations for the coming year from all sources increased, and are around the lower bound of the target range. In particular, expectations derived from the capital market for the first yearincreased from approximately 0.5 percent to 1.3 percent (Figure 14). Medium-term inflation expectations are within the target range, and long-term expectations remained anchored close to the midpoint of the target range (Figure 15). From the previous Monetary Committee decision until January 14, the shekel strengthened by 3.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Following the Bank of Israel's announcement of the amount of intervention to be executed in 2021, the shekel weakened by 5.2 percent. During the period as a whole, the shekel weakened by about 1.8 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, by 2 percent against the US dollar, and by about 0.6 percent against the euro (Figure 16). This trend is expected to support export performance in the exit from the crisis, and a return of inflation to within the target range. Home prices increased by 4 percent in the past year (Figure 21), while the increase in rental prices moderated. The number of home purchasesin recent months increased to a higher level than the precrisis level for all purchaser types. However, the total number of transactions for all of 2020 was similar to the 2019 level. New mortgage volume in January was NIS 6.4 billion, further to the high mortgage volumes in 2020 (Figure 22). There were relatively large price increases in Israel's equity market, compared with markets abroad, since the previous interest rate decision (Figure 32), in contrast to the trend of the last year. There were notable price increases in the technology and banking sectors. Government bond yields increased for most maturities, with the curves becoming steeper, similar tothe global trend. Corporate bond spreads remain low. However, according to the Business Tendency Survey, despite the decline in the difficulty of raising credit since the initial stage of the crisis, it remains high compared to before the crisis, particularly among small businesses (Figure 23). The global economy continues to recover in view of the decline in the scope of morbidity around the world. However, morbidity levels in some countries remained high, and the expansions of lockdowns and restrictions, as well as the difficulty in moving forward with vaccination campaigns, are expected to slow the pace of recovery in those countries. The IMF revised its growth forecasts upward, with the global economy expected to grow by 5.5 percent in 2021 (Figure 26). World trade continues to grow (Figure 27). Purchasing managers indices for January continued to indicate expansion of global activity in both the services and manufacturing components (Figure 28). Equity pricescontinued to increase, and the rally in oil and other commodity prices continued (Figure 30). Short-term inflation is expected to remain below central banks' targets, although there was an increase in longer-term expectations, particularly in the US. The monetary policies of the major central banks remain very accommodative. In the US, morbidity remains high but is in a downward trend, and the vaccination campaign accelerated during the recent period. GDP grew by 4 percent duringthe fourth quarter, and is 2.5 percent lower than its level in the fourth quarter of 2019. Sentiment indices point to a continued recovery in the beginning of 2021. In Europe, the high morbidity and continued lockdowns led to a contraction of GDP. First quarter growth is expected to be between near-zero and negative in the major countries, in view of most European countries so far having maintained a high level of restrictions and the pace of inoculating the population being relatively slow. The Japanese economy grew by about 3 percent in the fourth quarter, surpassing expectations, and further to the growth of the previous quarter,in view of strong export data. The rapid economic recovery in China continues. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on March 8, 2021. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. April 19, 2021, followed by a press briefing by the Governor. The economy is in the process of exiting the third lockdown that began at the end of 2020 and continued until the first week of February."
South Korea,2021-02-25,"The bank of korea. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period. Currently available information suggests that the recovery of the global economy has remained slow due to the ongoing influence of the movement restrictions following the resurgence of COVID-19. In global financial markets, stock prices and government bond yields in major countries have increased, mainly driven by the expectations for economic recovery following the expansion of vaccinations and the prospect of a further fiscal stimulus package by the new US administration. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by national policy responses and their effects. The Korean economy has continued to recover modestly. Although private consumption has remained weak as social distancing has been prolonged, exports have sustained their buoyancy led by the IT sector and facilities investment has continued to recover. Labor market conditions have remained weak, as the number of persons employed declined sharply compared to the corresponding period last year. Going forward, the economy is likely to continue its recovery, led by exports and investment. However, uncertainties surrounding the pace of recovery are judged to remain elevated. GDP growth this year is projected to be around 3.0%, generally consistent with the November forecast. Consumer price inflation has remained at the mid-0% level as the surging prices of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products were offset by factors such as the decreasing prices of public services. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has also remained at the mid-0% level. The inflation expectations of the general public have risen to 2%. It is forecast that consumer price inflation will run at the low- to mid-1% level this year, exceeding the November forecast of 1.0%, largely reflecting the increase in global oil prices and gradual improvement in economic activity. Core inflation is forecast to run at around 1%. In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate have risen, mainly driven by global financial market movements. Stock prices have fluctuated considerably, affected by both expectations for economic recovery and caution about the recent rally. Household loan growth has accelerated, and housing prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the recovery in the Korean economy is expected to be modest and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to remain weak, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process the Board will thoroughly assess developments related to COVID-19 as well as the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic, while paying attention to changes in financial stability conditions such as fund flows to asset markets and household debt growth."
Poland,2021-03-03,"Warsaw, 3 March 2021 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 3 March 2021 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 0.10%; lombard rate at 0.50%; deposit rate at 0.00%; rediscount rate at 0.11%; discount rate at 0.12%. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. The timing and scale of the conducted measures will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. The surge in COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions had a negative impact on global economic activity in 2020 Q4 and the beginning of 2021. The euro area slipped into recession again in 2020 Q4. Available data on the economic situation at the beginning of 2021 point to a continued weakness in the services sector, with further rise in industrial output in this economy. Inflation in the global economy is low, despite a slight rise recorded in some countries in January. The major central banks are keeping interest rates low and conducting asset purchases. Despite uncertainty about the development of the pandemic, financial market sentiment remains positive. This is accompanied by a rise in global commodity prices, including oil. In Poland, preliminary data on national accounts for 2020 Q4 confirmed that GDP fell in this period. Activity declined as a result of a fall in consumption and lower investment than a year ago. In turn, the fall in GDP was limited by the positive impact of net exports. Incoming data on the economic conditions in January indicate that the relatively good situation in the industrial sector continues, although industrial output growth slowed down. In turn, construction and assembly output and retail sales recorded significant falls. This was accompanied by a fall in average employment in the enterprise sector and a decline in annual growth of average wages in this sector. According to the GUS flash estimate, inflation stood at 2.7% y/y in January 2021. Following the fall in GDP in 2020, a rise in economic activity is expected in 2021, although the scale and pace of the recovery are uncertain. The further course of the pandemic and its impact on the economic situation in Poland and abroad continue to be the main source of uncertainty. The economic policy measures, including the easing of NBP's monetary policy introduced last year and the expected recovery in the global economy, will have a positive impact on the domestic economic situation. The pace of the economic recovery in Poland may be reduced by the lack of a visible and more durable zloty exchange rate adjustment to the global pandemic shock and to the monetary policy easing introduced by NBP. The Council became acquainted with the results of the March projection of inflation and GDP based on the NECMOD model. In line with the projection prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 16 February 2021 there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of 2.73.6% in 2021 (against 1.83.2% in the November 2020 projection), 2.0 3.6% in 2022 (compared to 1.63.6%) and 2.24.2% in 2023. At the same time, the annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 2.65.3% in 2021 (against 0.84.5% in the November 2020 projection), 4.06.9% in 2022 (compared to 3.87.8%) and 4.06.8% in 2023. These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in the secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In order to strengthen the impact of NBP's monetary policy easing on the economy. NBP may also intervene in the foreign exchange market. The timing and scale of the measures taken by NBP will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also continue to offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. NBP's monetary policy mitigates the negative economic impact of the pandemic, supports economic activity and stabilises inflation at the level consistent with NBP's medium-term inflation target. Due to its positive impact on the financial situation of debtors, it is also conducive to the strengthening of financial system stability. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  March 2021. The Council adopted the Resolution on National Strategy for Safety of Cash Circulation."
Ukraine,2021-03-04,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to raise the key policy rate to 6,5% per annum. The decision is aimed at gradually reducing inflation to its target, as the Ukrainian and global economies are recovering. Inflation accelerated in early 2021 and, as expected, deviated from the 5% Â± 1 pp target range. Consumer inflation increased to 6.1% yoy in January. Inflation continued to accelerate in February according to the NBU's preliminary estimates. Consumer inflation reading, which was calculated using online monitoring data, exceeded the NBU's forecast, while inflation expectations remained elevated. At the same time, the underlying inflationary pressure, as seen in core inflation, was generally in line with the regulator's forecast trajectory in JanuaryFebruary. Food and fuel prices contributed most to the rise in inflation in the first months of 2021. This is explained by poorer harvests and a rapid growth in global commodity prices, fueled by the fast pace of the revival in the global economy. Inflationary pressures from trading partner countries continued to increase. Domestic consumer demand remains robust. Moreover, the price trend continues to be influenced by the effects of last year's hryvnia depreciation. Inflation will reach its peak in mid-2021, but will decelerate afterwards, returning to its target range in H1 2022. The global and Ukrainian economies, which are recovering rather quickly, will produce significant inflationary pressures throughout the whole of 2021. However, the inflation trend will be reversed gradually as new harvest supplies come to the market, the effect of a low comparison base wanes for some products, and the NBU raises its key policy rate. Inflation will thus decelerate at the end of the year and will settle within the 5% Â± 1 pp target range in H1 2022. The primary assumption of the NBU Board is that Ukraine will continue to cooperate with the IMF. The NBU expects further progress to be made in negotiations between Ukraine and the IMF. Cooperation with the IMF and other international partners is essential for financing budget requirements and providing the economy with an additional impetus for growth. This will also enable Ukraine to maintain its international reserves at about USD 30 billion. As before, the imposition of stricter quarantine restrictions in Ukraine and globally to fight the COVID-19 pandemic remains the key risk to macrofinancial stability. Vaccination campaigns are already proving to be effective in some countries. However, they are being rolled out rather slowly, as a result of which the risk of tighter quarantine measures this year remains significant. In particular, some regions of Ukraine have seen a significant rise in morbidity in recent months. The pandemic still poses the threat of a decline in business activity and a cooling of consumer and investment demand. This, in turn, could rein in inflation. Conversely, the rapid recovery of business activity, rebounding commodity markets, the lagged effect of large-scale expansionary measures, and potential pent-up demand are generating risks of higher inflation globally. Under such conditions, among other things, inflationary pressures from Ukraine's main trading partners could increase further. There are other significant risks. volatile global capital marketsa more dramatic deterioration in the terms of trade an escalation of the military conflict in eastern Ukraine or on the country's borders.Given the above balance of risks and the significant rise in fundamental inflationary pressures seen in recent months, the NBU Board decided to raise the key policy rate, to 6,5%. The NBU stands ready to raise its key policy rate more resolutely in order to curb fundamental inflationary pressures, stabilize expectations, and bring inflation back to its target. The decision to increase the key policy rate, to 6,5%, was approved by an NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No.84, dated 4 March 2021. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 15 March 2021. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 15 April 2021, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
Armenia,2021-03-08,"PRESS RELEASE 03.08.2021 At the August 3, 2021 meeting, the CBA Board decided to raise the refinancing rate by 0.5 pp, setting it at 7.0%. Deflation of 0.8% was recorded in June 2021 compared with deflation of 1.4% registered in the same month of the previous year, in which case the 12-month inflation has increased to 6.5%. The 12-month core inflation continued accelerating too, reaching 7.8% at the end of June. In the third quarter of 2021, the economic activity and aggregate demand in the main partner countries to Armenia are rapidly recovering, in line with the CBA projections. In positive expectations of restoring global demand on the back of large-scale use of coronavirus vaccines in the world, high inflationary conditions are persisting in international commodity and food markets. Driven by the abovementioned developments and a number of temporary factors, higher-than-expected inflation rates are observed in the partner countries. In such a situation, the CBA Board continues to anticipate mostly an inflationary impact from the external sector on the Armenian economy. As current developments of 2021 show, the Armenian economic growth rates are somewhat exceeding the expectations, largely determined by more positive developments in agriculture and services. Aggregate demand is also recovering at high rates, which continues to be driven by persistently high private consumption growth, larger-than-expected volumes of remittances from abroad, and rapid growth of external demand. The latter is also reflected in continuous improvement of Armenia's external balance. The aforementioned demand factor developments mainly point to sustained inflationary effects. In view of expected macroeconomic developments in the global economy and Armenia, and the inflationary impacts deriving from them, the CBA Board finds it appropriate to continue raising the policy rate. At the same time, committed to neutralizing the risks of accelerating inflationary expectations amid growing domestic demand, the Board considers the necessity of possible tightening of monetary conditions in the near future. Under such conditions, the 12-month inflation is projected to remain high up until the end of the year, but will then gradually decrease and stabilize around the 4% target in the forecast horizon. The CBA Board estimates that, amid persisting uncertainties over the economic outlook, the risks to inflation deviating from the projected mid-term path are balanced, and should they materialize, the CBA would stand ready to respond accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective. You can read detailed information about setting the interest rate level in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by August 17, 2021. Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Kazakhstan,2021-03-09,"4 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.00% March 9, 2021 Nur-Sultan The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to keep the base rate unchanged at 9.00% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1.0 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities is to be set on 10.00% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 8.00% The decision was made on the basis of the prevailing pro-inflationary pressure in the economy associated with persisting imbalances in food markets, high uncertainty in the external sector, as well as the presence of accelerating inflation risks. The population's inflationary expectations are weakly anchored and remain at an elevated level. At the same time, it is expected that the disinflationary effect of consumer demand will gradually decrease, which will be due to the restoration of economic activity in the conditions of improving the epidemiological situation. The inflationary background in February 2021 remained unchanged, forming in accordance with the forecasts of the National Bank. The annual inflation rate amounted to 7.4% (7.4% in January 2021). The main contribution to inflation continues to be made by the acceleration of the food component, which grew by 11.6% (11.4%). The growth of the non-food component and paid services amounted to 5.2% (5.3%) and 3.9% (4.1%), respectively. In the structure of food inflation, an increase in the prÄ±ce of certain types of goods (oils and fats, eggs, sugar) is observed due to the limited supply, rising the prices on the world commodity markets and the prices of domestic producers. At the same time, the slowdown in the growth of prices for meat and meat products, bakery products and cereals, which was observed in the previous months, stopped in February. Restraining effects on inflation are being made by moderate growth rates of non-food products prices in light of suppressed consumer demand and trends in consumer preferences towards cheaper products. In the structure of paid services, a decrease in tariffs for certain types of housing and public regulated utility services is observed. The rise in prices for personal and leisure services continued. Seasonally-adjusted core inflation accelerated in February 2021 and amounted to 8.3% annually. For the first time since May 2020, core inflation estimates significantly exceeded overall inflation, which indicates the remained risks of accelerating inflation as a result of rising food prices and a faster recovery in consumer demand. Inflationary expectations of the population in February 2021 remained unchanged, while staying unstable and sensitive to the imbalances in certain food markets. The quantitative estimate of inflation for the year ahead was 6.7%. A high level of uncertainty remains among the respondents - more than a third of the respondents (34%) found it difficult to assess their expectations. In January 2021, business activity in a number of key sectors of the economy contracted, reflecting a deeper than expected decline in GDP (-4.5%). A significant decline was observed in the oil production sector, as well as in the transport and trade sectors. According to the leading indicator - the business activity index, in February 2021 there was a recovery to 49.0 points (in January - 48.4). According to the survey, enterprises in the real sector note an improvement in the business environment, for the first time since January 2020 the balance of answers on assessing current conditions turned out to be positive, amounting to 0.4. Enterprises believe that infrastructure, access to finance and credit, and business protection in general have improved. At the same time, the demand for products/services and the tax burden remain factors that have a negative impact on the business environment. The outlook for the global economy, including the economies of trading partner countries, has improved. The IMF predicts that global growth will accelerate to 5.5% in 2021, driven by the expected package implementation of incentive measures in large developed countries and a larger vaccination against COVID-19. The recovery dynamics in the Kazakhstan's trading partner countries' economies will continue. At the same time, the recovery of the Chinese economy will occur at a faster pace as result of increased investment activity and consumption, as well as growth in exports. In the EU countries, economic recovery will be constrained by the persistence of restrictive measures in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. In Russia, the OPEC+ agreement and weak domestic demand will constrain higher recovery growth. Forecasts for the future dynamics of oil prices have been revised upward due to the recovery in the global economy and expectations for an increase in demand, including for commodities. Despite the decision taken by OPEC+ to maintain the level of oil production, the prospects for the development of the world oil market are still associated with high uncertainty linked to the further dynamics of the pandemic, the effectiveness of vaccinations and further actions of OPEC+ participants. Under these conditions, as a prerequisite for the forecast round ""February-March 2021"", oil production in 2021 remained at the level of 86 million tons, the price of Brent oil under the baseline scenario was increased from $45 per barrel to $50 per barrel until the end of 2021 and for 2022. The National Bank adjusted its expectations for economic growth rates downward in the current year, taking into account the current dynamics and the deteriorating situation in certain sectors of the economy at the beginning of this year. In 2021, under the baseline scenario, economic growth will be 3.4%-3.7% (y/y) with an acceleration to 3.7-4.0% in 2022. The main contribution to economic growth will be made by the recovery of domestic demand on account of rising incomes of the population, continued implementation of government anti-crisis programs and improved investor sentiment. From the second half of 2021, a recovery in real exports is expected in conditions of an improving situation in the global economy and in Kazakhstan's trading partners. At the same time, the expected recovery in imports as a result of expanding domestic demand will limit the contribution of net exports to GDP growth. Annual inflation will slow down to the level of the upper limit of the target band of 4-6% in 2021 in accordance with the National Bank's estimates under the baseline scenario. This will be facilitated by the stabilization of the situation in individual food markets and the exit from the calculation of high values of growth in prices for food products. As the domestic epidemiological situation improves and economic activity recovers, consumer demand is expected to expand, which will gradually reduce the disinflationary pressure on the prices of non-food products and paid services. In the short term, pro-inflationary pressure from the external sector is expected to prevail due to the accelerating inflation in Russia (up to 5.7% in February of this year) and continuing growth in world food prices for nine months in a row, which led to multi-year highs of the FAO food price index. In the medium term, the inflationary background will remain moderate. This is evidenced by 2 estimates on the formation of inflation indicators in trading partner countries near the target, as well as expectations for the normalization of the situation in the world food markets. In general, the risks of accelerating inflation under the influence of internal and external factors continue to remain at a high level. Domestic risks are associated with the persistence of imbalances in certain food markets and a faster than expected recovery in domestic demand. The main factor of external risks remains the deteriorating situation of the coronavirus pandemic in the world caused by the emergence of new strains and the risks of ineffective vaccination. Such scenario could become an obstacle to the recovery of the world economy, cause a drop in oil prices and a disruption in the supply of goods and services. A high risk of an increase in the external inflationary background still present in view of a more prolonged rise in world food prices. In addition, the geopolitical risks persist, which are associated with the strengthening of sanctions rhetoric against trading partner countries, a potential increase in volatility in the global financial markets and a sharp decline in energy prices due to an increase in supply by OPEC+ countries and outside OPEC. External monetary conditions in developed countries will continue to remain stimulating in the medium term. The US Federal Reserve and the ECB continue to reiterate their commitment to stimulating monetary policy. At the same time, in developing countries, including the main trading partners of Kazakhstan, as inflationary processes accelerate, a transition to a cycle of rate increases is possible. According to our estimates, under the baseline scenario monetary conditions in the medium term will gradually return to neutral levels. The current balance of inflationary risks neutralized additional space for easing of monetary conditions. At the same time, in case of a significant deterioration in the prospects for inflation to further reduce to the target level, the National Bank, having all needed tools, will take the necessary proactive decisions. The next planned decision of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan about the base rate will be announced on April 26, 2021 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time.

Euroarea,2021-03-11,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of the meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. While the overall economic situation is expected to improve over 2021, there remains uncertainty surrounding the near-term economic outlook, relating in particular to the dynamics of the pandemic and the speed of vaccination campaigns. The rebound in global demand and additional fiscal measures are supporting global and euro area activity. But persistently high rates of coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, the spread of virus mutations, and the associated extension and tightening of containment measures are weighing on euro area economic activity in the short term. Looking ahead, the ongoing vaccination campaigns, together with the envisaged gradual relaxation of containment measures, underpin the expectation of a firm rebound in economic activity in the course of 2021. Inflation has picked up over recent months mainly on account of some transitory factors and an increase in energy price inflation. At the same time, underlying price pressures remain subdued in the context of weak demand and significant slack in labour and product markets. While our latest staff projection exercise foresees a gradual increase in underlying inflation pressures, it confirms that the medium-term inflation outlook remains broadly unchanged from the staff projections in December 2020 and below our inflation aim. In these conditions, preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period remains essential. Financing conditions are defined by a holistic and multifaceted set of indicators, spanning the entire transmission chain of monetary policy from risk-free interest rates and sovereign yields to corporate bond yields and bank credit conditions. Market interest rates have increased since the start of the year, which poses a risk to wider financing conditions. Banks use risk-free interest rates and sovereign bond yields as key references for determining credit conditions. If sizeable and persistent, increases in these market interest rates, when left unchecked, could translate into a premature tightening of financing conditions for all sectors of the economy. This is undesirable at a time when preserving favourable financing conditions still remains necessary to reduce uncertainty and bolster confidence, thereby underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability. Against this background, the Governing Council decided the following:. First, we will continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of â¬1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. Based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council expects purchases under the PEPP over the next quarter to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of this year. We will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy. If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation. We will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. Second, net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of â¬20 billion. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Third, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 per cent within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. Finally, we will continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. In particular, our third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO remains an attractive source of funding for banks, supporting bank lending to firms and households. Preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period for all sectors of the economy remains essential to underpin economic activity and safeguard medium-term price stability. We will also continue to monitor developments in the exchange rate with regard to their possible implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards our aim in a sustained manner, in line with our commitment to symmetry. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following the strong rebound in growth in the third quarter of 2020, euro area real GDP declined by 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter. Looking at the full year, real GDP is estimated to have contracted by 6.6 per cent in 2020, with the level of economic activity for the fourth quarter of the year standing 4.9 per cent below its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2019. Incoming economic data, surveys and high-frequency indicators point to continued economic weakness in the first quarter of 2021 driven by the persistence of the pandemic and the associated containment measures. As a result, real GDP is likely to contract again in the first quarter of the year. Economic developments continue to be uneven across countries and sectors, with the services sector being more adversely affected by the restrictions on social interaction and mobility than the industrial sector, which is recovering more quickly. Although fiscal policy measures are supporting households and firms, consumers remain cautious in the light of the pandemic and its impact on employment and earnings. Moreover, weaker corporate balance sheets and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook are still weighing on business investment. Looking ahead, the ongoing vaccination campaigns, together with the gradual relaxation of containment measures  barring any further adverse developments related to the pandemic  underpin the expectation of a firm rebound in economic activity in the course of 2021. Over the medium term, the recovery of the euro area economy should be supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a recovery in demand as containment measures are gradually lifted. This assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the March 2021 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP growth at 4.0 per cent in 2021, 4.1 per cent in 2022 and 2.1 per cent in 2023. Compared with the December 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for economic activity is broadly unchanged. Overall, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook over the medium term have become more balanced, although downside risks remain in the near term. On the one hand, better prospects for global demand, bolstered by the sizeable fiscal stimulus, and the progress in vaccination campaigns are encouraging. On the other hand, the ongoing pandemic, including the spread of virus mutations, and its implications for economic and financial conditions continue to be sources of downside risk. Euro area annual inflation increased sharply to 0.9 per cent in January and February 2021, up from -0.3 per cent in December. The upswing in headline inflation reflects a number of idiosyncratic factors, such as the end of the temporary VAT rate reduction in Germany, delayed sales periods in some euro area countries and the impact of the stronger than usual changes in HICP weights for 2021, as well as higher energy price inflation. On the basis of current oil futures prices, headline inflation is likely to increase in the coming months, but some volatility is expected throughout the year reflecting the changing dynamics of the factors currently pushing inflation up. These factors can be expected to fade out of annual inflation rates early next year. Underlying price pressures are expected to increase somewhat this year due to current supply constraints and the recovery in domestic demand, although pressures are expected to remain subdued overall, also reflecting low wage pressures and the past appreciation of the euro. Once the impact of the pandemic fades, the unwinding of the high level of slack, supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, will contribute to a gradual increase in inflation over the medium term. Survey-based measures and market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remain at subdued levels, although market-based indicators have continued their gradual increase. This assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the March 2021 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresees annual inflation at 1.5 per cent in 2021, 1.2 per cent in 2022 and 1.4 per cent in 2023. Compared with the December 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for inflation has been revised up for 2021 and 2022, largely due to temporary factors and higher energy price inflation, while it is unchanged for 2023. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of broad money (M3) stood at 12.5 per cent in January 2021, after 12.4 per cent in December and 11.0 per cent in November 2020. Strong money growth continued to be supported by the ongoing asset purchases by the Eurosystem, which remain the largest source of money creation. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 has remained the main contributor to broad money growth, consistent with a still heightened preference for liquidity in the money-holding sector and a low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid forms of money. Developments in loans to the private sector were characterised by somewhat weaker lending to non-financial corporations and resilient lending to households. The monthly lending flow to non-financial corporations continued the moderation observed since the end of the summer. At the same time, the annual growth rate remained broadly unchanged, at 7.0 per cent, after 7.1 per cent in December, still reflecting the very strong increase in lending in the first half of the year. The annual growth rate of loans to households remained broadly stable at 3.0 per cent in January, after 3.1 per cent in December, amid a solid positive monthly flow. Overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments and other European institutions, remain essential to support bank lending conditions and access to financing, in particular for those most affected by the pandemic. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary to support economic activity and the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 per cent over the medium term. Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy. To this end, support from national fiscal policies should continue given weak demand from firms and households relating to the ongoing pandemic and the associated containment measures. At the same time, fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should, as much as possible, remain temporary and targeted in nature to address vulnerabilities effectively and to support a swift recovery. The three safety nets endorsed by the European Council for workers, businesses and governments provide important funding support. The Governing Council recognises the key role of the Next Generation EU package and stresses the importance of it becoming operational without delay. It calls on Member States to ensure a timely ratification of the Own Resources Decision, to finalise their recovery and resilience plans promptly and to deploy the funds for productive public spending, accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural policies. This would allow the Next Generation EU programme to contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery and would increase economic resilience and the growth potential of Member Statesâ economies, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. Such structural policies are particularly important in addressing long-standing structural and institutional weaknesses and in accelerating the green and digital transitions."
Peru,2021-03-11,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT MARCH 2021 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation decreased from 2.7 percent in January to 2.4 percent in February due to supply factors that led to higher prices of some goods. Trend inflation remains in the lower part of the target range. Thus, year-on- year core inflation was 1.6 percent in February. Inflation is expected to remain within the target range throughout 2021 and 2022; and to lie at the lower part of the range by the end of 2022, as economic activity will remain below its potential level. One-year ahead expected inflation was 2.1 percent in February. Leading indicators and firms' growth expectations improved in February while most remain in the pessimistic territory. Global economic activity is expected to be more pronounced in next quarters as vaccination process continues around the world and significant stimulus packages are issued in United States. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows, and stands ready to expand monetary stimulus using a range of instruments. As of March 10. BCRP injection operations totaled S/ 63,724 million, of which S/ 50,122 million were associated with government- backed repos. S/ 1,272 million with repos conditioned to credits rescheduling, and S/ 245 million with repos conditioned to the expansion of long-term credit. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year.

Romania,2021-03-15,"In its meeting of 15 March 2021, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The annual CPI inflation rate rose to 2.99 percent in January 2021, from 2.06 percent in December 2020, and to 3.16 percent in February, i.e. well above the previously-expected level, under the transitory impact of the liberalisation of the electricity market for household consumers and following the rise in fuel prices driven by higher oil prices. These developments were only to a small extent counterbalanced by the opposite influences from the VFE segments and tobacco products, as well as from core inflation deceleration. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate continued to decrease slowly over this period, falling to 3.1 percent in January and staying at this level in February, from 3.3 percent in December 2020. Behind this stood mainly the disinflationary base effects associated with the developments in some processed food prices, to which added the modest influences of the aggregate demand deficit. The dynamics of this component are still marked by the pre-pandemic underlying inflationary pressures, reflecting, inter alia, the associated inflation expectations, along with influences from a rebound in consumption on certain segments, as well as from supply-side disruptions and costs linked with the pandemic and with the measures to prevent the coronavirus spread. In February 2021, the average annual CPI inflation rate remained flat at the 2.6 percent level reported in December 2020; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual rate continued to decline to 2.1 percent from 2.3 percent in December 2020. According to the recent statistical data, economic activity saw further a particularly fast recovery in 2020 Q4  the pace exceeded the forecast and lagged only slightly behind that seen in Q3  with the annual GDP decline slowing to -1.4 percent from -5.6 percent in Q3, given the 4.8 percent quarterly increase after the 5.6 percent pick-up in the previous quarter. This evolution makes it likely for the aggregate demand deficit to shrink way above expectations at end-2020, which implies a substantial change in the short- and medium-term outlook for the cyclical position of the economy. At the same time, the economic contraction in 2020 came in at only -3.9 percent and excluding the effect of agriculture  due to unfavourable weather conditions , it would have been -3.3 percent, among the lowest values in Europe. The upturn owed entirely to domestic demand. Alongside the change in inventories  whose expansionary impact largely counterbalanced the strong contractionary influence seen in the previous quarter , gross fixed capital formation also played an important part in boosting domestic absorption. Specifically, capital investment gained strong momentum in annual terms amid the markedly faster growth in new construction works, with the contribution, inter alia, from public investment and government programmes. At the same time, the negative annual dynamics of private consumption increased only marginally, as the impact of the renewed contraction in households' purchases  attributable mainly to the drop in services, in the context of the resurgence of the pandemic  was almost entirely countered by that of the rise in other sub-components, after their considerable decline in Q3. The negative contribution of net exports to annual GDP dynamics almost doubled amid a slightly more visible step-up in the dynamics of imports than in those of exports of goods and services, triggering also a renewed increase in the trade deficit versus the same period of the previous year. Under the circumstances, as well as following a more pronounced worsening of the primary income balance owing to dividend distribution flows, the current account deficit saw a larger advance in annual terms, in spite of rising inflows of EU funds to the current account. Financial market conditions continued to improve following the January 2021 policy rate cut, but later on reflected the influence of heightened global financial market volatility  amid investors' rising inflation expectations and concerns about the outlook for the Fed's monetary policy stance , as well as that stemming from much better-than-expected domestic macroeconomic developments recorded recently, as shown by statistical data. Thus, key interbank money market rates stuck to a steep downward path until towards end-January, before stabilising slightly above the monetary policy rate, while in the early days of March, they witnessed a visible upward adjustment, amid the tightening of liquidity conditions. In turn, yields on leu-denominated government securities saw renewed hefty declines in January  to a new historical low for 10Y bonds , which were, however, partly or fully corrected in the latter part of February. Lending rates on the main types of new business to non-bank clients also continued to go down December 2020 through January 2021 or consolidated at their previous low readings. At the same time, the EUR/RON exchange rate preserved its relative stability until end-February, inter alia amid the interest rate differential, before posting a slight upward adjustment, more modest than those seen in the region. The annual dynamics of credit to the private sector witnessed a sharper pick-up in December 2020, to 5.5 percent from 4.6 percent in November  as the flow of domestic currency credit increased to a historical high , and edged down to 5.1 percent in January 2021. The leu-denominated component saw its growth rate step up further in both months, to 8.8 percent in January 2021 against 8 percent in November 2020, amid the recovery of economic activity and as result of government programmes and falling interest rates; thus, in January, its share in total widened to 69.6 percent, a record high for the post-January 1996 period. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the March 2021 Inflation Report, which incorporates the latest available data and information. The new scenario shows a change in the inflation outlook versus the previous projection, as the updated path of the forecasted annual inflation rate is revised significantly upwards in the short term and to a smaller extent over the latter part of the projection horizon. Specifically, the annual inflation rate is anticipated to pick up gradually during 2021 until nearing the upper bound of the target band, under the impact of supply-side shocks, and  after a sizeable downward correction at the beginning of next year  to climb again and remain slightly above the mid-point of the target, amid the earlier reopening of the positive output gap and its subsequent slow widening. High uncertainties and risks to the new outlook stem, however, from the evolution of the pandemic and of the associated restrictive measures  amid the spread of the third pandemic wave, including domestically , as well as from the dynamics of vaccination worldwide, but especially across the EU. Other major sources of uncertainties and risks refer to the fiscal policy stance, in the context of the budget consolidation presumed to be carried out gradually over the medium term, alongside the absorption of European funds allocated to Romania, as well as labour market developments, under the influence of the public health situation and government support measures. Also relevant, however, are the synchronised uptrends in many commodity prices, as well as the recent heightening of international financial market volatility, accompanied by a broad-based increase in government bond yields, owing to investors' rising inflation expectations and concerns about the outlook for the Fed's monetary policy stance. In the meeting held today, 15 March 2021, based on the currently available data and assessments, and in light of the elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 1.25 percent per annum; moreover, it decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 0.75 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 1.75 percent per annum. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to preserve price stability over the medium term in line with the 2.5 percent Â±1 percentage point flat inflation target, in a manner supportive of the recovery of economic activity in the context of fiscal consolidation, while safeguarding financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be published on 16 March 2021 at 2:00 p.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 25 March 2021, at 3:00 p.m. The NBR Board approved the calendar of monetary policy meetings. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 12 May 2021."
Armenia,2021-03-16,"PRESS RELEASE 16.03.2021 At the March 16, 2021 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, on a 5.5% level. In February of 2021, inflation stood at 0.6% compared to 0.2% deflation recorded in the same month of the previous year, in which case the 12-month inflation and core inflation have increased to 5.3% and 5.5%, respectively, at the end of the month, mainly due to the effects transmitted from international commodity markets and the dram depreciation. The economic activity and demand recovery trends continue in the main partner countries to Armenia during the first quarter of 2021, and this is expected to persist in the mid-term horizon, mostly fueled by the implementation of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies in those countries. Positive expectations about recovery of global demand, as well as a number of supply factors, continue to drive the price increases in the international food and commodity markets. This also contributes to a higher-than- expected inflationary environment in the partner economies. In such a situation, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia still anticipates an inflationary impact on the Armenian economy from the external sector. The economic downturn in Armenia in the fourth quarter of 2020 somewhat exceeded the forecasts presented in the previous monetary policy program, mainly due to reduced activity in services and agriculture sectors. In the first quarter of 2021, the economic activity remains sluggish, which is still mainly caused by the decline in services sector, reflecting the impact of persistent weak demand and low private consumption. Notwithstanding the small expansionary fiscal policy, domestic demand is expected to remain somewhat subdued in the near-term future amid existing uncertainty and slowdown in the lending growth. Under such conditions, the Board of the CBA is not anticipating inflationary effects from the domestic economy. Back in December, forecasting some acceleration of inflation and inflation expectations due to supply factors, the Board of the CBA substantially tightened the monetary conditions. Taking the above into account and given the persisting environment of weak demand, the Board of the CBA finds it reasonable to leave the current policy rate unchanged. The Board agrees that in the near future as well, the monetary policy will target the neutralization of any risks of acceleration in inflation expectations, while trying to minimize the possible negative impact on the domestic demand recovery. As a result, after a certain acceleration in the near future, the 12-month inflation is projected to decrease and stabilize around the 4% target in the forecast horizon. The Board of the CBA reckons that, under high uncertainty over the economic outlook, the risks of inflation deviating from the mid-term projection path are balanced; if such risks materialize, the Central Bank stands ready to react accordingly, in fulfilment of the objective of price stability. Detailed information underlying the decision on the level of interest rate is available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program for the first quarter of 2021) to be published by March 30, 2021."
Brazil,2021-03-17,"In its 237th&#160;meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate to 2.75% p.a. In its 237th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate to 2.75% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Regarding the global outlook, new fiscal stimuli in some developed countries and the advancement of the COVID-19 immunization programs should promote a more robust economic recovery throughout the year. Economic slack and central bank communication from major economies suggest monetary stimuli will last long. However, market discussion regarding inflationary risks in these economies, and the associated repricing of financial assets, could result in a more challenging environment for emerging economies. Turning to the Brazilian economy, recent indicators, particularly the GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, continued to suggest a consistent economic recovery in spite of the reduction in the emergency income transfers. However, these readings do not capture the effects of the recent increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Prospectively, uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than usual, especially for the first and second quarters of this year. The continuing increase in commodities prices, measured in local currency, is affecting current inflation and has triggered additional increases in inflation forecasts for the next months, especially through its effects on fuel prices. In spite of these stronger and more persistent than expected short-term inflationary pressures, the Committee maintains the diagnosis that the current shocks are temporary, but continues to closely monitor its evolution. Inflation expectations for 2021, 2022, and 2023 collected by the Focus survey are around 4.6%, 3.5%, and 3.25%, respectively; and. The Copom's inflation projections in its baseline scenario, with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and exchange rate starting at R$5.70/US$* and evolving according to the purchase power parity (PPP), stand around 5.0% for 2021 and 3.5% for 2022. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2021 at 4.50% p.a. and rises to 5.50% p.a. in 2022. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 9.5% for 2021 and 4.4% for 2022. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, the worsening of the pandemic may delay the economic recovery, producing a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, an extension of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that aggravates the fiscal path or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium. The relative increase in the risks of these events imply an upward asymmetry to the balance of risks, i.e., in the direction of higher-than-expected paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The Committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 0.75 p.p. to 2.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021 and, mainly, 2022. The Copom members consider that the current conditions ceased to prescribe an extraordinary stimulus. GDP ended 2020 growing strongly at the margin, recovering most of its first-semester decline, and inflation expectations rose above target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy. Additionally, inflation projections increased to levels close to the upper bound of the target for 2021. Therefore, the Copom decided to start a process of partial normalization by reducing the extraordinary degree of monetary stimulus. For all the aforementioned reasons, the Committee considered appropriate an adjustment of 0.75 p.p. in the Selic rate. In the Committee's evaluation, a swifter adjustment has the benefit of reducing the probability of not meeting the inflation target in 2021, as well as of keeping longer horizon expectations well anchored. Additionally, the broad set of information available to the Committee suggests that this strategy is consistent with meeting the 2022 inflation target, even if social distancing increases temporarily. For the next meeting, unless there is a significant change in inflation projections or in the balance of risks, the Committee foresees the continuation of the partial normalization process with another adjustment, of the same magnitude, in the degree of monetary stimulus. The Copom emphasizes that its view for the next meeting will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and inflation projections and expectations. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Georgia,2021-03-17,"17.03.2021 The National Bank of Georgia raises the monetary policy rate by 0.50 percentage points to 8.50 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on March 17, 2021, and decided to raise the refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage points to 8.5 percent. Annual inflation stood at 3.6 percent in February. The reduction of inflation since last December is related to the subsidization of utility fees, which is of a temporary nature. Generally, central banks do not account for such temporary factors in monetary policy decisions and are guided by the medium- term inflation forecasts. The end of the subsidy from March 2021 will correspondingly be reflected in inflation rate. The base effect of this subsidy will have an upward impact on the inflation rate in December 2021 and January-February 2022. According to the current forecast, other things being equal, inflation will on average remain around 4-4.5 percent in 2021 and then gradually approach the target. The trend of price increases in international commodity markets, which has especially accelerated since the beginning of the year, is noteworthy among the factors affecting the dynamics of inflation. This is being reflected in the increased prices for oil products and selected food items. At the same time, on the back of reduced output due to the pandemic, the average production costs are higher, being another source for the upward pressure on inflation. The Committee also took into account that the persistence of depreciated exchange rate, given the high dollarization of the economy, is another factor pushing the inflation upwards. Moreover, the uncertainty about the recovery of the external demand remains elevated. As for domestic lending, despite the recent slowdown, it continues to grow moderately. In addition, inflation remaining above the target for a prolonged period, intensifies the risks for increasing inflation expectations that could possibly be translated into the increased inflation in future. Taking into account the abovementioned factors, the Committee decided to tighten monetary policy and to increase the policy rate by 50 basis points. However, at this stage, there is no apparent need of additional policy tightening over the course of the year. According to the preliminary data, aggregate demand is weak. Based on rapid estimates, economic activity fell by 11.5 percent year-on-year in January. Amid easing restrictions, a gradual recovery of economic activity is expected throughout the year, the main driver of which will be domestic demand. In contrast, external demand will remain significantly reduced. As for the current indicators, the revenue from international travelers is minimal and decreased by 95 percent year-on-year in January. Amid weak aggregate demand and depreciated exchange rate, according to the preliminary data, goods imports fell by 12 percent year-on-year in February, while goods exports slightly improved and posted 3 percent annual growth. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on April 28, 2021."
United States,2021-03-17,"EDT March 17, 2021 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Following a moderation in the pace of the recovery, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak. Inflation continues to run below 2 percent. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations. The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT March 17, 2021labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C. Williams.

Egypt,2021-03-18,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release March 18th 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 825 percent, 925 percent, and 875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 875 percen. Annual headline urban inflation inched up to 45 percent in February 2021 from 43 percent in January 2021, after having decelerated from 54 percent in December 202. The slight increase in February 2021 was driven by the unfavorable base effect and reflected the higher annual contribution of nonfood item. Meanwhile annual food inflation remained stable after contributing to the decline in January 2021, in light of the continued reversal of the transitory shock in tomato price. Furthermore annual core inflation remained stable at 36 percent for the second consecutive month in February 202. Real GDP growth at market prices increased in 2020 Q4 to record a preliminary figure of 20 percent, up from 07 percent during 2020 Q3 and a contraction of 17 percent during 2020 Q. Detailed growth figures in 2020 Q3 illustrate that consumption continued to support economic activity, offsetting the combined unfavorable contributions of gross domestic investments and net export. Moreover most leading indicators are gradually recovering to their pre-pandemic level. Meanwhile the unemployment rate broadly stabilized at 72 percent during 2020 Q4 compared to 73 percent during 2020 Q3, after improving markedly from the 96 percent recorded during 2020 Q2 due to the sustained improvement in employment level. Global economic activity continues to show varying paces of recovery across countries and economic sectors, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to weigh on the outloo. Prospects for global economic recovery remain contingent on the scale of distribution, as well as the efficacy of vaccine. Global economic and financial conditions are expected to remain accommodative and supportive of economic activity over the medium term, although global yield curves have steepened recentl. Meanwhile international prices for oil, food and other commodities have surged to post-pandemic highs, with the level of uncertainty increasing regarding their future price trajectorie. The surge in international oil prices was largely driven by supply side developments, while the increase in the prices of other commodities stemmed from both supply and demand side factor. Against this background, the MPC decided that keeping policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 7 percent (Â±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandat.

Turkiye,2021-03-18,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to increase the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 17 percent to 19 percent. Global growth outlook has improved and international commodity prices have risen on the back of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies as well as positive developments in the vaccination process. Rising global inflation expectations lead to uncertainties about advanced economy monetary policies, and volatility in global financial markets. Economic activity is on a strong course. As the pandemic-related restrictions are being eased, economic activity is expected to pick up in services and related sectors. Nevertheless, risks for economic activity remain significant depending on possible developments regarding the course of the pandemic. Strong domestic demand due to the cumulative effects of high credit growth during the pandemic and the rise in import prices continue to adversely affect the current account balance. On the other hand, credit growth, which has slowed down amid tighter financial conditions, has recently trended upwards. Domestic demand conditions, cumulative cost effects, in particular the exchange rate effects, increasing international food and other commodity prices and high levels of inflation expectations continue to affect the pricing behavior and inflation outlook adversely. On the other hand, supply constraints intensifying in some sectors and the adjustments in wages and administered prices maintain their importance for the medium-term inflation outlook. While the expectation that the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand to become more significant is maintained, the projected gradual waning in demand and cost factors is being delayed by the recent upward trend in credit growth and increase in import costs. Considering the upside risks to inflation expectations, pricing behavior and the medium-term inflation outlook associated with these developments, the MPC has decided to implement a front-loaded and strong additional monetary tightening. The tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively, taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, for an extended period until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability. In regard to the indicators pointing to a permanent fall in inflation and price stability, indicators for the underlying trend of inflation and pricing behavior, diffusion indices, demand and cost factors, and inflation expectations will continue to be monitored closely for their compatibility with the targets in the forecast horizon. Additional monetary tightening will be delivered if needed. The balance between the monetary policy rate and actual/expected inflation will be sustained decisively to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until permanent price stability and the 5 percent target are reached. Sustaining the tight monetary policy stance in such a manner, besides attaining permanent price stability, will foster macroeconomic and financial stability positively by facilitating the fall in country risk premium, the reversal in currency substitution, the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs. In its decision-making process, the CBRT adopts a framework with a medium term perspective, based on analyzing all factors affecting inflation and the interaction between these factors. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Pakistan,2021-03-19,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement March 19, 2021. At its meeting on 19th March 2021, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the policy rate at percent. The MPC noted that since the last meeting in January, growth and employment have continued to recover and business sentiment has further improved. While still modest, at around percent, growth in FY21 is now projected to be higher than previously anticipated due to improved prospects for manufacturing and reflecting in part the monetary and fiscal stimulus provided during Covid. Recent inflation out-turns have been volatile, with the lowest reading on headline inflation in more than two years in January 2021 followed by sharp rise in February. According to SBP estimates, the recent increase in electricity tariffs and sugar and wheat prices accounts for about 1Â½ percentage points of the percentage point increase in inflation between the January and February out-turns. The recent increase in electricity prices will continue to manifest in headline numbers in coming months, keeping average inflation in FY21 close to the upper end of the previously announced range of 7-9 percent. While noting that the recent increase in inflation is primarily due to supply-side factors, the MPC also highlighted that the output gap is still estimated to be negative, core inflation continues to be relatively subdued, and inflation expectationsâwhile drifting up somewhat due to the recent increase in headline inflation numbersâare still well-anchored. Looking ahead, as the temporary increase in inflation from administered prices wanes, inflation should fall to the 5-7 percent target range over the medium-term. Given this underlying inflation trajectory, the MPC felt that the existing accommodative stance of monetary policy remained appropriate to support the recovery while keeping inflation expectations well-anchored and maintaining financial stability. From policy mix perspective as well, given that fiscal policy is expected to remain contractionary to reduce public debt, the MPC noted that it was important for monetary policy to be supportive as long as second-round effects of recent increases in administered prices and other one-off supply shocks do not materialize and inflation expectations remain well anchored. In reaching its decision on the policy rate, the MPC also took note of the uncertainty around the inflation and growth outlook. On the growth front, the MPC noted that despite recent momentum, risks remain due to the emergence of third, more virulent wave of Covid in Pakistan just as the vaccine roll-out is beginning. In terms of the inflation outlook, this summer's wage negotiations and any new tax measures in the next year's budget could add further supply-side shocks. In addition, optimism about stronger US-led world recovery this year is translating into higher international commodity prices, including both food and oil, which could continue to feed into domestic inflation. These trends in the outlook for inflation and growth will need to be carefully monitored. In the absence of unforeseen developments, the MPC expects monetary policy settings to remain broadly unchanged in the near term. As the recovery becomes more durable and the economy returns to full capacity, the MPC expects any adjustments in the policy rate to be measured and gradual to achieve mildly positive real interest rates. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Real sector. The economic recovery underway since last summer continues, buoyed by appropriately supportive monetary policy, the SBP's temporary refinancing facilities, and targeted fiscal support. Large-scale manufacturing (LSM) grew further by 10. percent (y/y) in December 2020 and. percent (y/y) in January 2021. Through the first seven months of FY21. LSM has grown by. percent, compared to contraction of. percent during the same period last year. Nevertheless capacity utilization in number of industries is still lagging and labor market slack remains. wide range of other high-frequency indicators signal robust growth, including sales of fast-moving consumer goods, automobiles, cement. POL and electricity. In services, transportation is benefiting from the pick-up in manufacturing, while business sentiment indicators foresee further improvements in both activity and employment in coming months. In agriculture, all major Kharif crops except cotton have surpassed production levels in FY20 and targets for FY21, and indicators of input conditionsâsuch as tractor sales, fertilizer usage, water availability, and weatherâsuggest strong prospects, especially for wheat. External sector. The current account remains in surplus of $0. billion through the first seven months of FY21 on the back of record remittances, relatively subdued domestic demand and nascent recovery in exports. At $230 million, the current account deficit in January was around one-third of its level in December 2020. As the economy recovers, the trade deficit is widening somewhat on the back of imports of capital goods and industrial materials as well as food, together with rising international commodity prices. Nevertheless the current account deficit in FY21 is still expected to remain below percent of GDP given the out-turn to date, continued strong prospects for remittancesâwhich have remained above $2 billion for the last monthsâ and the on-going pickup in exports, especially high value-added textiles. The recent staff-level agreement on the resumption of the IMF program has further boosted prospects and ensured that external financing needs will be comfortably met. These favorable developments and improving sentiment contributed to an additional. percent appreciation in the PKR since the last MPC meeting, which now stands close to one-year high, and helped to keep SBP's foreign exchange reserves around $13 billion, levels last seen three years ago. Fiscal sector. Fiscal developments continue to evolve largely in line with the consolidation envisaged in this year's budget, as the necessary fiscal stimulus imparted in Q4 of FY20 is unwound. During H1 FY21, the fiscal deficit stood at. percent of GDP, broadly unchanged from the same period last year despite higher interest and Covid-related payments. This mainly reflects healthy growth in revenues, with FBR net tax revenue provisionally growing by. percent (y/y) through February to surpass target levels despite higher refunds, and non-tax revenue increasing by 16. percent (y/y) through December on account of SBP profit transfers and the petroleum levy. Despite higher non-interest current expenditures, the primary balance posted surplus of. percent of GDP during H1 FY21. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary and inflation outlook. The MPC noted that despite the recent slight uptick in market yields, financial conditions remain appropriately accommodative given continued slack in the economy, on-going fiscal consolidation and well- contained risks to financial stability. Following seasonal contraction due to retirement of working capital loans in January, private sector credit has resumed its expansionary trend across all major lending categories. Through FY21 so far, private sector credit has surpassed last year's corresponding levels on the back of sizable expansion in fixed investment loans and consumer financing, primarily due to the lower interest rate environment as well as the SBP's subsidized refinancing schemes, especially LTFF and TERF. While prices of perishable food items have moderated since the last MPC, hikes in administered prices, sugar and wheat led to significant rise in headline inflation in February 2021, arresting the downward trend observed since September 2020. However given continued spare capacity in the economy, core inflation remains more subdued and has actually declined in rural areas. Moreover there is little evidence of de- anchoring of inflation expectations or economy-wide wage pressures. As result, while headline inflation may continue to remain elevated in coming months due to administered prices and base effects, underlying price pressures from the demand-side or second-round effects should remain contained. Looking further ahead, this year's upcoming round of wage negotiations, next year's budget, and the path of domestic energy prices and international commodity prices may have an important bearing on the inflation trajectory. The MPC will monitor these developments carefully and react to them appropriately when needed. Page."
Russia,2021-03-19,"On 19 March 2021, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to increase the key rate by 25 b.p. to 4.50% per annum. In the first quarter, the rate of consumer price growth has been higher than the Bank of Russia's forecast. Domestic demand is recovering more steadily and faster than expected, outstripping the pace of output growth in a number of sectors. The expectations with regard to external demand are also improving on the back of additional fiscal support measures in certain countries and accelerating vaccination paces of the population. Inflation expectations of households and businesses remain elevated. The balance of risks has shifted towards proinflationary ones. The fast recovery of demand and elevated inflationary pressure call for a return to neutral monetary policy. The Bank of Russia will continue to determine the timeline and pace of a return to neutral monetary policy taking into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. That said, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further increases in the key rate at its upcoming meetings. Given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will return to the Bank of Russia's target close to 4% in the first half of 2022 and will remain at that level further on. Inflation dynamics. Inflation is developing above the Bank of Russia's forecast. In February, the annual consumer price growth rate rose to 5.7% vs 5.2% in January and, according to the 15 March assessments, reached 5.8%. Based on Bank of Russia estimates, indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements substantially exceed 4% (annualised). This largely reflects a steady nature of the recovery in domestic demand. Its influence on price growth rates is enhanced by restrictions on foreign travel. The funds that households have been unable to spend for this purpose are partially redistributed in favour of domestic goods and service consumption. Additional pressure on price growth is exerted by supply-side factors that constrain the production of certain goods. Inflation expectations of households remain elevated compared to the pre-pandemic period. Businesses' price expectations also remain at an elevated level. Analysts' medium-term expectations are anchored close to 4%. The fast recovery of demand and elevated inflationary pressure call for a return to neutral monetary policy. The Bank of Russia forecasts that annual inflation will peak in March and go down further on. Given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will return to the Bank of Russia's target close to 4% in the first half of 2022 and will remain at that level further on. Monetary conditions remain accommodative and have not seen any significant changes since the previous meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors. Short-term OFZ yields rose reflecting the expectations of a faster return to neutral monetary policy by the Bank of Russia. Growing yields of medium- and long-term OFZs largely reflect the increase of interest rates in global financial markets. Loan and deposit rates mainly remained unchanged. Lending continues to grow at rates close to recent years' highs. Apart from accommodative monetary conditions, lending dynamics are influenced by the preferential programmes implemented by the Government as well as by regulatory relaxations. When making its key rate decisions, the Bank of Russia will consider the impact of cancelling these anti-crisis measures on monetary conditions. Economic activity. The pace of economic recovery is higher than expected. According to the Bank of Russia's monitoring, increasingly more businesses report that their production rate has returned to the pre-pandemic level. The recovery in retail trade and services is supported by a gradual lifting of restrictions. However, in certain sectors, the capacity for output expansion is lagging behind the expanding demand. Consumer sentiment continued to improve in JanuaryâFebruary. Market surveys demonstrate that businesses' expectations remain positive. In 2021 and onwards. Russian economic growth will gain support from an improved outlook for the global economy as further fiscal support measures are rolled out across a number of countries, which is set to accelerate growth in demand for Russian export commodities. The medium-term economic growth path will be markedly influenced by the paces of vaccination in Russia and globally, the efficacy of vaccines against new virus strains, the nature of recovering private demand, as well as by the path of budget consolidation. Inflation risks. The balance of risks has shifted towards proinflationary ones. The impact of proinflationary factors may prove more protracted and expressed against the backdrop of outrunning growth in consumer demand relative to the capacity of output expansion. Their impact may be further strengthened by elevated inflation expectations and the associated secondary effects. Further upward pressure on prices may continue to come from temporary disruptions in production and supply chains. Proinflationary risks are generated by price movements in global commodity markets, including supply-side factors. This could have a bearing on domestic prices of relevant goods. Short-term proinflationary risks are also connected with stronger volatility in global markets, driven by various geopolitical developments, among other factors, which may have an effect on exchange rate and inflation expectations. Given that the global economic recovery is progressing at faster paces than previously expected and the need is no longer in place for extremely accommodative policies in advanced economies, an earlier monetary policy normalisation by central banks in these countries is possible. This may become a further driver of volatility growth in global financial markets. Disinflationary risks in the baseline scenario have receded. Opening up the borders concurrently with a gradual lifting of restrictions may lead to a recovery in the consumption of foreign services and weaken supply-side constraints in the labour market through inflows of foreign labour force. The economic recovery may be held back by a slower rollout of vaccination programmes, the spread of new virus strains, and the entailing toughening of restrictions, among other factors. Persistent changes in consumer preferences and behaviour including a potentially higher propensity to save are poised to exert a constraining influence on inflation. Medium-term inflation is significantly impacted by fiscal policy. In its baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia proceeds from the parameters of the federal budget and the budgets of constituent territories reflected in the Guidelines for Fiscal. Tax and Customs and Tariff Policy for 2021 and the 20222023 Planning Period, as well as from the announced time frames for the completion of anti-crisis measures of the Government and the Bank of Russia. The Bank of Russia will factor in the implications for the forecast of potential investment decisions as regards the liquid part of the National Wealth Fund in excess of the 7% GDP threshold. The Bank of Russia will continue to determine the timeline and pace of a return to neutral monetary policy taking into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. That said, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further increases in the key rate at its upcoming meetings. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 23 April 2021. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the Bank of Russia' medium-term forecast are to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. Statement by Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina in follow-up to Board of Directors meeting 19 March 2021. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Nigeria,2021-03-23,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 135 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON MONDAY 22ND AND TUESDAY 23RD MARCH 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 22nd and 23rd of March 2021 confronted with downside risks to the optimism for significant improvement in global output recovery in 2021. The risks stem largely from the uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines in surmounting the new variants of the novel coronavirus, as well as speedy deployment of the vaccines across the globe. In the domestic economy, the exit from recession in the fourth quarter of 2020 brought about a renewed hope for full recovery in 2021, notwithstanding the obvious downside risks to the entire global economy. The Committee appraised the developments in both the global and domestic economic and financial environments in the first quarter of 2021 and the outlook for the rest of the year. Nine members of the Committee were in attendance. Global Economic Developments The Committee noted that while vaccination against COVID-19 had gained significant grounds in major advanced economies, some emerging market and developing economies were yet to commence any form of vaccination. This development portends an uneven recovery to global growth, as barriers to trade and the global supply chain are likely to remain in place much longer than anticipated to prevent re-infection in countries that have achieved significant vaccination and some form of herd immunity. The growing concerns associated with the efficacy of these vaccines, especially in the face of new variants of the virus, however, poses a significant threat to the overall recovery of the global economy. The broad direction of the expected rebound in global 1 output recovery, therefore, varies across countries depending on the headwinds confronting individual economies. Consequently the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a growth rate of 43 per cent for the advanced economies and 63 per cent for the emerging and developing economies, with a global growth rate of 55 per cent in 2021. The downside risks to this projection are associated with concerns that the existing vaccines being deployed may not effectively subdue the new and existing variants of the virus and thus, restrictions may remain in place which may hamper the speed of the expected recovery globally. Price developments across major advanced economies remain subdued alongside the expectation that output gaps will remain negative into the medium term. In the Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs), price development was, on average, mixed, with some economies recording inflation rates that were significantly higher than those seen in the Advanced Economies. This was mostly due to continued capital outflows, poor accretion to reserves and exchange rate depreciation, which has a pass-through effect to domestic prices. In the global financial markets, conditions remain relatively stable, as central banks continue to maintain expansionary monetary policy and sizeable stimulus packages. The huge level of monetary and fiscal injections may heighten the risk of financial instability, especially when central banks commence adjustment of policy rates. Domestic Economic Developments Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), recorded a growth rate of 011 per cent (year-on-year) in the fourth quarter of 2020, in contrast to -362 per cent in Q3 2020 and 255 per cent in the corresponding period of 2019. The Q4 2020 performance, was a sharp rebound in contrast to the two previous quarters of negative growth (-362 per 2 cent in the third quarter and -610 per cent in the second quarter). The improved performance was driven by the non-oil sector, which grew by 169 per cent in Q4 2020 from -251 and -605 per cent in Q3 and Q2 2020, respectively. The major drivers were Quarrying and Other Minerals, which grew by 4842 per cent and the ICT subsector, which grew by 1764 per cent. The oil sector, however, contracted further by -1976 per cent in Q4 2020, from -1389 and -663 per cent in Q3 and Q2 2020, respectively. This was attributed largely to the decrease in oil production in compliance with the OPEC+ production cut agreement. The Committee noted the moderation in the Manufacturing, and Non- manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMI), which, however, remained below the 50 index points in February 2021, but improved to 4870 index points apiece, compared with 449 and 433 index points, respectively, in January 2021. The GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 and expected recovery in Q1 2021, were signposted by this observed improvement in the PMIs. The employment level index component of the manufacturing and non- manufacturing PMIs also improved moderately in February 2021 to 456 and 480 index points, compared with 442 and 450 index points, respectively, in the previous month. The Committee, however, expressed some optimism that the legacy growth headwinds, attributed largely to the resurgence in infection rate of COVID-19 pandemic, may likely recede in the short-to-medium term, as the successful deployment of the COVID-19 vaccines and the various stimulus packages to revamp the domestic economy are sustained. The Committee noted with concerns the continued uptick in inflationary pressure for the eighteenth-consecutive month, as headline inflation (year-on- year) continued on an upward trend, to 1733 per cent at end-February 2021 from 1647 per cent in January 2021. This increase continued to be attributed to the increase in both the food and core components of inflation which rose 3 to 2179 and 1238 per cent in February 2021, respectively, from 2057 and 1185 per cent in January 2021. This persisting uptick in food inflation, however, was the major driving factor to the uptick in headline inflation. This was due to the worsening security situation in many parts of the country, particularly, the food producing areas, where farmers face frequent attacks by herdsmen and bandits in their farms. While the Bank is intervening significantly in the agricultural sector, the rising insecurity in some food producing areas, is limiting the expected outcomes in terms of supply to the market, thus contributing to the rise in food prices. The Committee further noted that the key drivers of the increase in core inflation included, the hike in the price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), upward adjustment in electricity tariffs and the depreciation of the domestic currency (naira). The Committee observed that broad money supply (M3) grew marginally by 030 per cent in February 2021, following a substantial growth of 1354 per cent in December 2020. This was driven largely by the contraction in Net Foreign Assets (NFA). The Committee also noted that Net Domestic Assets (NDA) grew by 302 per cent in February 2021, from 222 per cent in December 2020. Provisional data showed that banking system credit to the economy increased by 175 per cent to N4367 trillion in February 2021 from N4292 trillion in January 2021, reflecting the ongoing broad-based monetary and fiscal stimulus to various sectors of the economy. The Committee thus, enjoined the Bank to maintain its current drive to improve access to credit to the private sector, while exploring other initiatives with the fiscal authorities to improve funding to critical sectors of the economy. Conscious of the persisting inflationary pressure fuelled largely by continued uptick in food prices, the Committee noted the Bank's interventions to boost food production particularly through its various Agricultural programmes. Other complementary measures included, increase in disbursement for the dry season agricultural programme to increase output, the adoption of high yield seeds to improve productivity and the adoption of harvested produce as a 4 means of loan repayment, which has stemmed hoarding and the activities of middlemen and rent seekers. The establishment of the strategic grain reserves for staple crops has also helped in addressing seasonality of agricultural commodities. In terms of funding, the Committee noted that the Bank has disbursed funds under its various agricultural interventions towards improving food supply in Nigeira. The Committee noted the disbursement of â¦10760 billion to 548,,109 farmers cultivating 703,,619 hectares of land between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 to boost dry season output in support of agricultural value chain development. Total disbursements as at end-February 2021 amounted to â¦1487 trillion under the various agricultural programmes, of which N68659 billion was disbursed under the Commercial Agricultural Credit Scheme (CACS) and â¦60175 billion under the Anchor Borrowers Programmes (ABP) to 3,,038,,649 farmers to support food supply and dampen inflationary pressures. Under the Targeted Credit Facility, the Bank has disbursed N21816 billion to 475,,376 beneficiaries, of which 34 per cent of beneficiaries are SMEs. Under AGSMEIS. N11162 billion has been disbursed to 28,,961 beneficiaries, 70 percent of which are in the agricultural sector. Under the Creative Industry Financing Initiatives mainly targeted at youths. N319 billion has been disbursed to 341 beneficiaries, of which 53 percent is to the movie industry. Under the National Mass Metering Programme. N3345 billion has been disbursed to 9 distribution companies for the procurement of 605,,852 meters, while N8989 billion has been disbursed under the Nigeria Electricity Market Stabilisation Facility (NEMSF 2) to 11 distribution companies to improve the electricity supply industry in Nigeria. Under the N100 billion Health Care intervention Fund, the Bank has disbursed N9434 billion, and is willing to expand the facility, to 85 projects in the pharmaceutical industry, hospitals and State governments for both brown field and green field projects, mostly to expand pharmaceutical drug lines, acquire 5 MRI and other equipment and upgrade laboratories and other hospital services. Under the N10 trillion Manufacturing Intervention Stimulus, the total of N80336 billion has been disbursed to 228 projects across various sectors in agro-allied, mining, steel production and packaging industries, amongst others. The monthly weighted average Inter-bank call and Open Buy Back (OBB) rates fell to 180 and 150 per cent in February 2021 from 350 and 230 per cent in January 2020, respectively, reflecting the continued liquidity surfeit in the banking system. The Committee noted the weak performance in the equities market despite the recent increased patronage by domestic investors. The All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalization (MC) continued to decline due to portfolio switching from equities to fixed income securities, reflecting the perception of improved yields at the long end of the yield curve. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) fell by 111 per cent to N2082 trillion on February 26, 2021 from N2106 trillion on December 31, 2020. This was attributed largely to investor sell-off, which continued to cause price depreciation of large and medium capitalized stocks. The MPC noted the performance of the Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) of the DMBs which showed a Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 152 per cent. Non-Performing Loans (NPL) ratio of 63 per cent and Liquidity Ratio (LR) of 405 per cent, as at February 2020. On non-performing loans (NPLs), the MPC noted that the ratio remained above the prudential benchmark of 50 per cent and urged the Bank to sustain its regulatory measures to bring it below the prudential benchmark. The Committee noted with satisfaction the improvement in the level of external reserves, which stood at US$3646 billion at end-February 2021, compared with 6 US$3494 billion at end-January 2021. This reflects the recent upsurge in crude oil prices on the backdrop of the renewed optimism on the successful deployment of COVID-19 vaccines across the globe. Outlook The medium-term outlook for both the domestic and global economies indicates cautious optimism. This is premised on the expectation of sustained policy support and successful deployment of the COVID-19 vaccines around the globe and its effectiveness in ensuring herd immunity. Available data and forecasts for key macroeconomic variables for the Nigerian economy suggest further rebound in output growth for the rest of 2021. This is predicated on the sustained, as well as additional interventions by the monetary and fiscal authorities to keep up the recovery momentum in the economy, favourable upsurge in crude oil prices, foreign exchange market stability and successful deployment of the new COVID-19 vaccines that could further stimulate economic activities and ultimately boost output growth. Given the potential rebound in output growth, bolstered by the resumption of economic activities post COVID-19, inflationary pressure in the economy is projected to moderate in short-to-medium term. The underlying risks of the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines against known and newly emerging strains of the virus, the uncertainty that the existing vaccines could lead to herd immunity and unequal access to COVID-19 vaccine, however, are some of the headwinds that could undermine this forecast. The Committee's Considerations The Committee noted the moderate recovery in output growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, associated mainly to the positive impacts of the several monetary and fiscal measures implemented to reflate the economy, following the negative consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. This in the Committee's consideration, provides an opportunity for further consolidation as most projections suggest substantial recovery in several economies across 7 the globe. However the Committee was not oblivious of the downside risks to the broad outlook for recovery in 2021, as efforts to achieve herd immunity continued to face significant headwinds. The Committee welcomed the current efforts by the government and other support agencies in procuring vaccines and thus, urged the quick and efficient deployment of the vaccines to support ongoing monetary and fiscal stimulus towards full recovery of the economy in 2021 and into 2022. Members expressed concerns about the unabated rising trend of domestic prices and re-emphasized the exigency for monetary and fiscal policy collaboration to finance productive ventures, improve aggregate supply and push down prices. The MPC reiterated its concerns on the activities of persons and groups causing security challenges in the food producing areas of the country, as this has contributed to the major uptick in food prices across the country. The Committee, thus called for a collaborative and coordinated efforts by all the relevant agencies and stakeholders towards addressing the prevailing insecurity issues and social challenges. The Committee also called on the government to explore the option of effective partnership with the private sector to improve funding sources necessary to address the huge infrastructural financing deficit. Considering the foregoing, the MPC noted that fiscal headroom remained constrained and fragile, following the twin shocks of the pandemic and oil price volatility and the continued build-up of public debt. The MPC noted the Bank's innovative efforts towards maintaining exchange rate stability. It also impressed on the Management to remain focused on its drive to increase accretion to reserves, especially in its recent incentives to attract diaspora remittances into the country. The Committee welcomed the relative strengthening of the money market compared from its position at the end of the lockdown. Mindful of the risks 8 confronting the economy, it emphasised the need for the fiscal authority to improve the investment climate towards attracting sustainable Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The Committee commended the Bank for maintaining a robust regulatory environment despite these challenging times by ensuring that non-performing loans (NPL) ratio is driven down to prudential level, even as aggregate credit continue to grow in a market confronted with relative uncertainties. In summary, the MPC noted the overarching need to address the twin major challenges of taming the rising inflation and sustaining growth recovery in the economy, while focusing on the downside risks associated with the injections. The Committee's Decision At this meeting, the dilemma that confronted the MPC relates to whether to continue to focus on efforts to stimulate outputs or whether to focus on reining in inflation, which(at 1733 per cent) is almost attaining the January 2017 inflation level of 1872 per cent. MPC was also worried that the level of unemployment must be addressed swiftly to moderate the restiveness among the populace. Again members were generally of the view that given that the exit from recession is fragile, any decision to tighten or rein-in inflation, may reverse the fragile recovery and return the economy into recession. In the light of the foregoing, the consensus among MPC members was that, given that inflation is substantially a supply side phenomenon, there is need to continue to focus on consolidation o the recovery process, by taking those actions that would continue to stimulate output growth, create employment, but at the same time have an eye on effort to moderate the inflationary pressure; using the current administrative measures being adopted by the Bank in controlling monetary aggregates in the banking system. In its consideration of whether to tighten, hold or loosen, therefore, the Committee felt that with inflation at a 3-year high and price stability being the Bank's core mandate, a contractionary policy stance may be required to 9 tame the rising trend. It nevertheless feels that tightening will hike the cost of capital and hamper investments required to create employment and continue to boost recovery. On the other hand. MPC thinks that whereas loosening would lower rate and improve access to credit which will drive investment, reduce unemployment and stimulate aggregate demand, it feels that loosening will create excess liquidity, which will intensify demand pressure on the foreign exchange market, thereby leading to further depreciation in the currency. It therefore, feels that a hold position which encourages Management to continue to use its various intervention mechanisms to deploy liquidity into employment generation and output stimulating sectors of the economy would be desirable as this would help consolidate the country's recovery process. The Committee, therefore, decided by a vote of 3 members to increase MPR by 50, 75 and 50 basis points respectively, and 6 members voted to hold all parameters constant. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Retain the MPR at 115 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 275 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 23rd March 2021 10."
Czech Republic,2021-03-24,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank unanimously kept interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 0.25%, the discount rate at 0.05% and the Lombard rate at 1%. . This decision of the Bank Board is underpinned by the winter macroeconomic forecast and by an assessment of information obtained since it was prepared. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates initially, followed by a gradual rise in rates from roughly the middle of this year onwards. The Bank Board assessed the uncertainties and risks of the forecast in the context of the ongoing pandemic as remaining very substantial. This could lead to a need to keep the monetary conditions accommodative for rather longer than in the forecast. The current outlook for GDP growth in the effective euro area is slightly lower for this year, owing to a deterioration of the epidemic situation there and an extension of lockdowns, and is unchanged for next year. The outlook for foreign industrial producer prices this year has moved upwards significantly. This is mainly because of a rise in the energy component, reflecting a higher oil price outlook. However, the core component has also increased. Besides costlier material inputs, energy and transport, this rise reflects the resilience of euro area industry to the pandemic so far. By contrast, the outlook for industrial producer price inflation in 2022 has been lowered. Consumer prices will also rise faster than previously expected this year. This will reflect their surprisingly strong increase at the start of the year and the higher oil price outlook. Next year, however, inflation will moderate roughly to the values expected by the forecast, mainly because of an only gradual recovery of the euro area from the pandemic. The outlook for foreign interest rates is broadly unchanged. The Brent crude oil price rose significantly during February and March, with its outlook shifting appreciably above the assumptions of the current forecast. The euro-dollar exchange rate expected for this year and the next is almost unchanged. So far this year, domestic inflation has returned towards the target from above and has been rather higher than expected in the forecast. The deviation from the forecast was due mainly to food price inflation, which accelerated unexpectedly at the start of the year. Core inflation, which was above the forecast despite decreasing in February, also contributed to the deviation from the forecast. In early 2021, administered price inflation slowed somewhat more markedly than forecasted. The moderation of the year-on-year decline in fuel prices was in line with the projection. The same was true for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes. According to the current forecast, inflation will fluctuate around the target this year and will be slightly above it next year as a result of an increase in excise duty on cigarettes. At the close of last year, the Czech economy faced a renewed tightening of anti-epidemic measures connected with the onset of the autumn wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite this, its output rose by 0.6% quarter on quarter and recorded a smaller year-on-year decline than forecasted. The deviation was partly due to a larger positive contribution of net exports and faster growth in government consumption. Conversely, the downturn in household consumption was slightly larger than expected. Gross capital formation was broadly in line with the prediction. The current forecast expects the adverse economic impacts of the pandemic to subside gradually and household and business sentiment to improve in the course of this year. The output of the economy will return to year-on-year growth in Q2. In 2021 as a whole, the economy will grow by more than 2%. The growth will pick up further next year, fostering a gradual return of economic activity to the pre-pandemic level. The January indicators confirm the so far relatively moderate impacts of the ongoing pandemic on domestic industrial production. However, production shortfalls in the domestic automotive industry due to disruptions to supplies of components at the start of this year may signal that the current wave of the pandemic is beginning to adversely affect this sector, too. Construction remains in a downturn. In early 2021, the situation in retail and other services was adversely affected by more restrictive anti-epidemic measures compared with the forecast, which may be reflected in a deeper decline in household consumption in 2021 Q1 than expected in the winter forecast. Despite worsening slightly at the close of last year, the labour market remains in relatively good shape. The increase in unemployment at the turn of the year was broadly as expected. Wage growth was well above the forecast in 2020 Q4, especially in market sectors. This was due to lower tax optimisation and higher wage growth in the healthcare sector, but partly also to stronger fundamental wage growth. The koruna appreciated against the euro in the first half of February but then weakened as a result of a deterioration in the domestic pandemic situation. So far in Q1, the koruna has been 20 hellers stronger than forecasted on average. The koruna will continue to appreciate gradually according to the forecast. In a situation of unprecedented uncertainty affecting both economic life itself and the way it is captured by the statistical data, the winter forecast is materialising in a fairly satisfactory way so far. The somewhat smaller-than-expected year-on-year decline in economic activity in 2020 Q4 is good news. The February inflation figure was slightly higher than forecasted. The share of unemployed persons has been roughly as forecasted in 2021 Q1 so far. The unexpectedly sharp acceleration of the average wage at the close of last year was therefore the biggest surprise, although this was largely due to non-fundamental factors."
Mongolia,2021-03-24,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged and setting the refinancing amount No: 2021/01 Date: March 24, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia held a scheduled meeting on March 24, 2021. With due consideration to the current state and future outlook of the economy and financial markets, as well as to risks inherent in domestic and foreign environments, the MPC, with the purpose of continuing to ease financial conditions, reached a decision to: 1. Keep the policy rate unchanged at 6 percent; 2. Provide up to MNT 350 billion under the long-term repo financing instrument in the second quarter of 2021. The scope of this funding instrument is expanded to include businesses in the manufacturing and services sectors, as well as entities with more than 200 employees operating in the trade sector. Annual headline inflation stands at 2.6 percent nationwide and 2.0 percent in Ulaanbaatar city as of February 2021. It is expected that while the impact of demand-side factors on inflation will gradually increase in the coming quarters as the economy recovers, supply-driven inflation will rise due to the base effect of fuel and refined fuel prices. Although the baseline projection indicates that inflation will stabilize around its medium-term target in 2021, the outlook could deviate due to the situation pertaining to the spread of Covid-19 and vaccination performance. If vaccination continues successfully, it is expected that economic activity will pick up and businesses will return to normal levels. Export revenues increased by 73 percent in the first two months of 2021, and the manufacturing sector grew by 66 percent and 37 percent in January and February, respectively. Moreover, the international ratings agency. Moody's, has upgraded the outlook of Mongolia's credit rating from ânegativeâ to âstableâ on the basis of increased accumulation of foreign reserves, lower short-term external debt pressures, and a positive economic outlook. The step-by-step implementation of monetary and macroprudential policy measures and the adoption of new financing instruments by the central bank directed at mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic contribute to facilitating economic recovery and ensuring banking sector stability. The MPC shall make the necessary policy adjustments in the event that inflation exceeds its target. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Philippines,2021-03-24,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility at 2.0 percent. The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were likewise kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. The Monetary Board noted that latest inflation forecasts have shifted higher over the policy horizon. Inflation may breach the upper end of the target range of 2-4 percent in 2021, reflecting the impact of supply-side constraints on domestic prices of key food commodities such as meat as well as the continuing uptick in international oil prices. Nevertheless, inflation is still seen to return within the target band in 2022 as supply-side influences subside. Meanwhile, the balance of risks to the inflation outlook remains broadly balanced around the baseline path in 2021 while leaning toward the downside in 2022. Tighter domestic supply of meat products and improved global economic activity could lend further upside pressures on inflation. However, the ongoing pandemic also continues to pose downside risks to the inflation outlook, as the recent surge in virus infections and challenges over mass vaccination programs continue to temper prospects for domestic demand. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board is of the view that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriate to support the Government's broader efforts to facilitate the recovery of the economy. At the same time, however, the Monetary Board emphasizes that the timely implementation of non-monetary interventions is crucial in mitigating the impact of supply-side pressures on inflation and thereby preventing them from spilling over as second-round effects. Looking ahead, the BSP will remain watchful for any signs of inflation becoming broader based. The BSP is prepared to take immediate measures as appropriate to ensure that the monetary policy stance continues to support the BSP's price and financial stability objectives."
Thailand,2021-03-24,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 2/2021 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 24 March 2021 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent to support the economic recovery which remained highly uncertain. The Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to expand, but downside risks and uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook remained high in the period ahead. The economy would thus need support from the continued low policy rate. The Committee therefore voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting to preserve the limited policy space to act at the appropriate and most effective timing. The Thai economy was projected to expand by 30 and 47 percent in 2021 and 2022 respectively, somewhat lower than the previous projection in line with lower tourist figures and the impacts of the new wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. However the economy would be supported by a fast recovery in merchandise exports, which was in line with the expansion of trading partner economies, as well as the economic stimulus measures additionally announced. Nonetheless the recovery would remain uneven across economic sectors. Significant risks included the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccination, the recovery in foreign tourist figures, and the continuity of fiscal support. The financial system remained sound despite vulnerabilities in some segments due to the negative shocks from the recent COVID-19 outbreak, particularly low- income households and SMEs. Headline inflation was projected to return to the target in the middle of 2021 and would stay close to the lower bound of the target range throughout the forecast period. Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target. Despite ample overall liquidity and low financing costs, the distribution of liquidity remained uneven due to increased credit risks. This was a result of more fragile financial positions, particularly for businesses that experienced slow recovery and households that were additionally affected by the recent outbreak. Long-term government bond yields rose in tandem with US Treasury yields. On exchange rates, the Thai baht depreciated against the US dollar in line with regional currencies. The Committee would closely monitor developments in the financial markets and assess their implications on the recovery in the period ahead, as well as continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem. The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery going forward. Monetary policy must remain accommodative. The Committee encouraged the expedition of the new financial rehabilitation measures to support business recovery post-COVID-19 to ensure distribution of liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner, reduce debt burden, and support the economic transformation in the period ahead. While financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring, fiscal measures must continue to sustain the economy. In particular, the government should expedite budget disbursement under the restoration plan once the new wave of the outbreak become well contained. In addition, the government should simultaneously implement supply-side policies to support business restructuring and upskilling of labor, which would help support sustainable economic recovery in the long term. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to emphasize supporting the economic recovery. The Committee would monitor the adequacy of the government measures and various risks, especially the outbreak situation in Thailand and abroad, in deliberating monetary policy going forward. The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary."
Mexico,2021-03-25,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 4.00%. Global economic activity continued to recover heterogeneously across countries and sectors. Financial markets exhibited volatility and US medium- and long-term interest rates increased in response to the large fiscal stimulus package approved and expectations of higher growth. Inflation in advanced economies increased recently, although it remains below the targets of their central banks, which reiterated that they will maintain accommodative monetary policy stances. Among the most relevant global risks are the pandemic, delays in the vaccination programs, and a greater tightening of financing conditions. Since the last monetary policy decision, the Mexican peso depreciated and medium- and long-term interest rates increased. Mexico's economic activity decelerated in January and February and, although a greater boost from external demand is foreseen, ample slack conditions are expected throughout the forecast horizon. Annual headline inflation increased from 3.54% in January to 4.12% during the first fortnight of March and core inflation rose from 3.84% to 4.09% during the same period. Headline inflation expectations for the end of 2021 were adjusted upwards and those for the medium and long terms remained stable at levels above the 3% target. The anticipated paths for headline and core inflation in the short term are slightly above those foreseen in the last Quarterly Report, although they are still expected to converge to the 3% target as of the second quarter of 2022. Over the next months, headline inflation will be temporarily affected by the arithmetic effects generated by last year's fall in energy prices. These forecasts are subject to risks. On the upside: a recomposition of spending towards merchandise or cost-related pressures; episodes of exchange rate depreciation; and external inflationary pressures. On the downside: effects stemming from the negative output gap; greater social distancing measures; and foreign exchange appreciation. In a highly uncertain environment, the risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets pose major challenges for monetary policy. It is necessary to enable an orderly adjustment of financial conditions and a change in relative prices, without affecting price formation and inflation expectations. Considering the abovementioned inflation forecasts, the risks they are subject to, as well as the need to consolidate a downward trajectory for headline and core inflation to the 3% target, with the presence of all its members, the Governing Board decided unanimously to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 4.00%. Looking ahead, monetary policy implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on inflation, on its foreseen trajectories within the forecast horizon, and on its expectations. 1 The Governing Board will take the necessary actions based on incoming information in order for the policy rate to be consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. It is necessary to safeguard the institutional framework, strengthen the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopt the necessary actions on both monetary and fiscal policy fronts, to enable a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole."
South Africa,2021-03-25,"PRESS STATEMENT 25 March 2021 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the January meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), a second wave of Covid-19 infections has come and gone, with lockdown restrictions further reduced. Until vaccination is widespread and populations develop sufficient immunity to curb virus transmission, it is expected that these waves of infection will continue. As indicated by public health authorities, a third wave of virus infection is probable in coming months. Despite further expected waves, the start of vaccinations in many countries has lifted projections for global economic growth and boosted confidence significantly. The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) January forecast for growth in global gross domestic product (GDP) for 2021 was revised up to 5.5%. The SARB's forecast for global growth in 2021 is now 5.8%.1 For 2022, we expect global growth of about 3.7%. 1 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. For 2020 this is now at -3.1% (up from -3.6% in January) and for 2021 revised up from 5.0% to 5.8%. The IMF's global forecast for 2022 sits at 4.2%. MPC Statement 25 March 2021 Page 1 Despite this more optimistic outlook, distribution of vaccines will be slow, contributing to an uneven pace of global economic recovery this year and next. Financial markets have generally improved in line with stronger growth and expectations that policy settings in advanced economies will remain accommodative. Capital flows to emerging markets increased in December and January. However, in recent weeks, renewed uncertainty resulted in more volatility in flows and currencies. This reflects considerable sensitivity to risk, particularly where economies fail to take advantage of improved global prospects or run large macroeconomic imbalances. Even though global policy rates are likely to remain accommodative, risk aversion will persist. South Africa's economy expanded by 6.3% on a quarterly, annualised basis in the fourth quarter of 2020, and contracted by 7% for the year as a whole. The Bank's forecast for GDP for the first quarter of 2021 stands at -0.2%, down from 1.0% at the time of the January MPC meeting. With stronger quarterly outcomes for the rest of this year, the economy is expected to grow by about 3.8% (up from 3.6%). Getting back to pre-pandemic output levels will take time. While recent lockdown restrictions have proved less constraining to economic activity, loadshedding has been substantial and consumption moderated after December. Rising oil prices have increased the economy's total import bill, offsetting some income gains from a stronger terms of trade. Sharply lower public and private investment last year and continued weakness in 2021 will weigh on growth prospects. GDP is expected to grow by 2.4% in 2022 and by 2.5% in 2023, unchanged since the January meeting. MPC Statement 25 March 2021 Page 2 Overall, risks to the domestic growth outlook are assessed to be balanced. Global growth, progress in vaccination, a low cost of capital, and high commodity prices are all supportive of growth. However, new waves of the Covid-19 virus are likely to weigh on economic activity both globally and locally. In addition, ongoing constraints to the domestic supply of energy and uncertainty about vaccine rollout continue to pose downside risks to growth. The large current account surplus at present reflects good growth and higher prices for exports, moderate prices for imported oil, and very weak demand for imported consumer and investment goods. This surplus is expected to give way to a modest current account deficit as the year progresses.2 Despite recent volatility, on balance, accommodative policies in many advanced economies and the improved economic outlook will support global financial markets and strengthen international capital flows. This broad improvement in the global environment resulted in net capital inflows to South Africa in December and January, before giving way to net outflows in recent weeks. Although financing conditions have modestly improved and fiscal risk has eased, the yield curve for rand-denominated assets remains steep. Despite these generally favourable global conditions and considerable rand appreciation through the latter half of 2020 and into this year, the rand remains below its estimated long-run equilibrium value. Since the January meeting, the rand has appreciated by 1.3% on a trade-weighted basis. The implied starting point for the rand 2 The current account is expected to be in surplus of 1.3% of GDP in 2021, shifting to a deficit of -0.8% in 2022. MPC Statement 25 March 2021 Page 3 forecast is R14.96 to the US dollar, compared with R15.70 at the time of the previous meeting. Headline consumer price inflation averaged 3.3% in 2020. The forecast for 2021 is higher at 4.3% (up from 4.0%) and for 2022 slightly lower at 4.4% (down from 4.5%). Core inflation also averaged 3.3% in 2020. The core inflation forecast for 2021 is slightly lower at 3.3% (down from 3.4%) and unchanged for 2022 and 2023 at 4.0% and 4.3%, respectively. Oil prices have been revised up sharply in the forecast, resulting in higher petrol price inflation, at 12.7% for 2021, compared to 4.4% at the time of the January meeting.3 Electricity prices are significantly higher at 9.7% for 2021 (up from 8.1%). Expectations of future inflation have eased further in the first quarter of this year. Inflation expectations of households continue to moderate from quite high levels. Market-based expectations for short-term inflation are lower, but have increased for the medium and longer-term horizons.4 The overall risks to the inflation outlook appear to be balanced. A more appreciated nominal exchange rate in recent months, and generally low pass-through, is expected to continue to moderate some inflationary pressure. The Committee additionally notes 3 Our assumptions are now for oil prices to average about $62 per barrel in 2021 (up from $50) and $60 per barrel in 2022 and in 2023. 4 The latest (Q1) Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey expectations for 2021 eased to 3.9% from 4.2%, to 4.2% from 4.5% for 2022 and are at 4.4% for 2023. Household inflation expectations have eased further to 5.0% from 5.3%. Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) expect inflation to be higher at 4.1% (from 3.8%) in 2021, at 4.3 (from 4.2) in 2022 and unchanged at 4.5% in 2023. Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These now sit at 4.4% for the 5-year and 5.9% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year breakeven inflation sits at 6.8%. MPC Statement 25 March 2021 Page 4 the significant, but likely temporary, reduction in medical insurance price inflation this year. While global food price inflation remains high, local food price inflation is slightly lower than previously expected and should remain broadly contained due to higher local crop production. Oil prices have increased sharply this year and are expected to remain at these levels over the forecast horizon. Electricity and other administered prices remain upside risks to the inflation trajectory. While there are no demand side pressures evident at present, higher growth in 2021 and no change in the potential growth rate implies a narrowing of the output gap over the forecast period, compared to the January meeting. Unless the risks outlined earlier materialise, inflation is expected to be well contained in 2021, before rising to around the midpoint of the inflation target range in 2022 and 2023. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep rates unchanged at 3.5% per annum. The implied policy rate path of the Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) indicates an increase of 25 basis points in each of the second and fourth quarters of 2021. Compared to the previous meeting, the shift in the rate path from the third to the fourth quarter is due to somewhat lower inflation in 2022. Monetary policy continues to be accommodative, keeping financial conditions supportive of credit demand as the economy recovers from the pandemic and associated lockdowns. The Bank has ensured adequate liquidity in domestic markets and will continue to closely monitor funding markets for stress. In addition, regulatory relief provided to banks continues to support lending to households and firms. MPC Statement 25 March 2021 Page 5 Important macroeconomic gains would be realised by achieving a stable public debt level, increasing the supply of energy, moderating administered price inflation and keeping inflation low into the recovery. Such steps will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy. Economic and financial conditions are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. In this uncertain environment, policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. The MPC will seek to look through temporary price shocks and focus on second round effects. As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting in response to new data and risks.

Colombia,2021-03-26,"Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). The unanimous decision to maintain an expansive monetary policy position takes into account the following considerations. Banco de la Republica's board of directors (BDBR) in its meeting on March 26 held the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%. The unanimous decision to maintain an expansive monetary policy position takes into account the following considerations. Annual inflation to February was below the BDBR's target at 1.56%. Year-end inflation expectations remain stable, averaging 2.7% and 3.1% for 2021 and 2022, respectively. Growth forecasts for this year have been revised upward; the Bank's technical staff now projects a preliminary figure of 5.2%. Labor market indicators continue to be very weak, with the unemployment rate in January reaching 17.3%. The financial system continues to provide favorable and stable conditions for solvency and liquidity. In this context, the credit portfolio and interest rates continue to respond to monetary policy stimulus. External financial conditions continue to favor financing of the Colombian economy. However, factors including a recent increase in medium- and long-term interest rates on international financial markets suggest that conditions have tightened on the margin. The decision to hold interest rates was based in large part on the BDBR's confidence that Colombia's Congress will approve a fiscal adjustment program sufficient to provide a return to economic growth and put the public finances back on a sustainable path.

Chile,2021-03-30,"Monetary Policy Meeting  March 2021 At its monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to hold the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50%. Furthermore, no changes were made to the unconventional liquidity and credit support measures. The decisions were adopted by the unanimous vote of its members. On the external front, 2020 closed with better-than-expected indicators, probably associated with a better adaptation of the world economy to the pandemic, in a context of complex sanitary conditions in some regions and a vaccination process that continues to advance at varying speeds across countries. Monetary and fiscal stimuli continue to be very important. In this regard, the fiscal package approved in the United States a few weeks ago deserves mention, and there is some concern about its magnitude and potential effect on inflation. Commodity prices have risen, copper included. In this context, the external scenario has improved for Chile, thanks to better prospects for its main trading partners, higher terms of trade and still favorable financial conditions. The improved global outlook has been reflected in the financial markets, where an increase in long-term interest rates and stock markets, and a decrease in risk premiums are worth noting. In Chile, similar trends have been observed, with interest rate hikes in fixed-income instruments in pesos and UFs, especially for maturities of 10 years or more. Local stock market indexes have also risen. The exchange rate, with ups and downs, remains around the levels of the previous meeting. Regarding bank credit, lending is still low in general. The flow of commercial credit has shown some rebound lately, due to a greater use of the Fogape-Reactiva line. At the same time, the funds drawn on the FCIC3 amounts to about 15% of the total available. Interest rates for the different credit categories remain low from a historical perspective. Locally, the data for late 2020 and early 2021 show that the economy is growing faster than was forecast in the December MP Report. The trade sector continued to lead the recovery, followed by manufacturing. Although at a slower pace, services and construction [INF*RES*AS] also recovered from their mid-year lows. In the labor market, there was an increase in hours worked and employment, but it lagged behind activity. The application of stronger sanitary restrictions will affect the economy's performance in the immediate future. However, their effects will be milder than previously observed, as companies have learned to operate under these conditions and the government has proposed new measures to support households. All in all, the growth outlook for 2021 has risen compared to the end of last year, due to the higher starting point, the advances of the vaccination process, and the improvement of conditions abroad. Headline inflation has continued to hover around 3% annually, with significant monthly fluctuations and surprises in opposite directions. Thus, the February CPI was below market expectations, after an unexpected increase in January. In the behavior of inflation of recent months, it is worth singling out the higher prices of volatile products such as fuels and fruits and vegetables, plus the high demand that persists for certain goods. This, in a context of still uneven inventory replenishment. The annual variation of core CPI (without volatiles) has remained stable since December. Regarding expectations, one year ahead the median of the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) remains at 3%, while the Financial Operators Survey (EOF) placed it at 3.2%. Two years ahead, both surveys have it at 3%. The Board considers that, even as the outlook for the economy has improved, the convergence of inflation to the target in the policy horizon requires that monetary policy remain highly expansionary. Thus, the MPR will be held at its 0.5% minimum until the recovery of the economy takes hold and spreads to the more lagging components of expenditure, which will take several quarters. The Board reiterates that future changes in monetary policy will depend on the evolution of the macroeconomic outlook and its implications for the evolution of inflation. The unconventional measures will continue to operate under the same conditions in place, complementing the monetary policy stance defined by the MPR. Any future modifications will be announced with sufficient notice. The March Monetary Policy Report containing the projections and analyses that guide the Board's decisions will be released tomorrow. Wednesday 31 at 8:30 hours. The minutes of this monetary policy meeting will be published at 8:30 hours on Thursday 15 April 2021. The next monetary policy meeting is scheduled to take place on Wednesday 12 and Thursday 13 May 2021, and the statement thereof to be published at 18 hours of the 13th. The Spanish original prevails."
Armenia,2021-04-05,"PRESS RELEASE 04.05.2021 At the May 4 meeting, the CBA Board decided to raise the refinancing rate by 0.5 pp, setting it at 6.0%. In March 2021, inflation stood at 1.0% relative to 0.5% in the same month of the previous year, in which case the 12-month inflation has increased to 5.8%. The 12-month core inflation has accelerated by the same amount, reaching 6.6% at the end of March. In the first half of 2021, signs of faster than expected economic activity and demand recovery are observable in the main partner countries of Armenia due to the implementation of stimulative policies and some positive results of the use of coronavirus vaccines. In the light of positive expectations of the recovery of global demand and a number of supply factors, high inflationary developments continue to be seen in international food markets, which is also reflected in shaping of a higher-than-anticipated inflationary environment in partner countries. In such a situation, the CBA Board continues expecting inflationary impact from the external sector on the Armenian economy. The developments of economic activity in the first quarter of 2021 point to more positive economic trends compared with previous forecasts of the Central Bank of Armenia. Driven by growing global demand and increased remittances from abroad, as well as more positive developments in lending, the aggregate demand will recover faster than expected, but will still remain weak. At the same time, according to the estimations of the Central Bank of Armenia, public uncertainty about the future course of inflation and, to a certain extent, the inflation expectations, have increased. As a result, as estimated by the Board, some inflationary effects from the domestic economy are also emerging. In view of the current macroeconomic situation and the inflationary effects expected from the external and domestic economies, the CBA Board estimates that the stimulative stance of monetary policy needs to phase out gradually and considers it appropriate to raise the policy rate. The Board agrees that in the near future the monetary policy will be consistent in neutralizing the risks to accelerating inflation expectations, without harm, as much as possible, to the pace of recovery of domestic demand. Under such conditions, the 12-month inflation is projected to gradually decrease after a certain acceleration in the short run, stabilizing around the 4% target in the forecast horizon. The CBA Board reckons that the risks to inflation deviating from the projected mid-term path amid uncertainties about economic outlook are balanced, and in case of their emergence the CBA stands ready to respond accordingly, ensuring the fulfilment of the price stability objective. You can read detailed information on setting of the level of interest rate in Press Release to be published by May 18, 2021 (Minutes on Interest Rate). Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
India,2021-04-07,"Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) April 5-7, 2021 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (April 7, 2021) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Since the MPC's meeting in February, lingering effects of the slowdown in the global economy in Q4 of 2020 have persisted, although recent arrivals of high frequency indicators suggest that a gradual but uneven recovery may be forming. The much anticipated boost to economic activity from the vaccination rollouts is being somewhat2 held back by new mutations of COVID-19, second and third waves of infections across countries and unequal access to vaccines more generally. World trade activity improved in Q4:2020 and January 2021. There are, however, concerns due to COVID-19-related fresh lockdowns and depressed demand in a few major economies, escalation in shipping charges and container shortages. Inflation remains benign in major advanced economies (AEs), although highly accommodative monetary policies and large fiscal stimuli have added to concerns around market-based indicators of inflation expectations, unsettling bond markets globally. In a few emerging market economies (EMEs), however, inflation is ruling above targets, primarily driven by firming global commodity prices. This has even prompted a few of them to raise policy rates. Equity and currency markets have been turbulent with the increase in long-term bond yields and the steepening of yield curves. More recently, however, calm has returned and major equity markets have scaled new peaks in March, while currencies are trading mixed against a generally firming US dollar. With the bond markets sell-offs. EME assets came under selling pressure and capital outflows imposed depreciating pressures on EME currencies in March. Domestic Economy 3. The second advance estimates for 2020-21 released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on February 26, 2021 placed India's real gross domestic product (GDP) contraction at 8.0 per cent during the year. High frequency indicators  vehicle sales; railway freight traffic; toll collections; goods and services tax (GST) revenues; e-way bills; and steel consumption  suggest that gains in manufacturing and services activity in Q3:2020-21 extended into Q4. Purchasing managers' index (PMI) manufacturing at 55.4 in March 2021 remained in expansion zone, but lower than its level in February. The index of industrial production slipped into marginal contraction in January 2021, dragged down by manufacturing and mining. Core industries also contracted in February. The resilience of agriculture is evident from foodgrains and horticulture production for 2020- 21, which are expected to be 2.0 per cent and 1.8 per cent higher respectively than the final estimates of 2019-20. Headline inflation increased to 5.0 per cent in February after having eased to 4.1 per cent in January 2021. Within an overall food inflation print of 4.3 per cent in February, five out of twelve food sub-groups recorded double digit inflation. While fuel inflation pressures eased somewhat in February, core inflation registered a generalised hardening and increased by 50 basis points to touch 6 per cent.3 5. System liquidity remained in large surplus in February and March 2021 with average daily net liquidity absorption of â¹5.9 lakh crore. Driven by currency demand, reserve money (RM) increased by 14.2 per cent (y-o-y) as on March 26, 2021. Money supply (M ) grew by 11.8 per cent as on March 26, 2021 with credit growth at 5.6 per 3 cent. Corporate bond issuances at â¹6.8 lakh crore during 2020-21 (up to February 2021) were higher than â¹6.1 lakh crore during the same period last year. Issuances of commercial paper (CPs) turned around since December 2020 and were higher by 10.4 per cent during December 2020 to March 2021 than in the same period of the previous year. India's foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 99.2 billion during 2020-21 to US$ 577.0 billion at end-March 2021, providing an import cover of 18.4 months and 102 per cent of India's external debt. Outlook 6. The evolving CPI inflation trajectory is likely to be subjected to both upside and downside pressures. The bumper foodgrains production in 2020-21 should sustain softening of cereal prices going forward. While the prices of pulses, particularly tur and urad, remain elevated, the incoming rabi harvest arrivals in the markets and the overall increase in domestic production in 2020-21 should augment supply which, along with imports, should enable some softening of these prices going forward. While edible oils inflation has been ruling at heightened levels with international prices remaining firm, reduction of import duties and appropriate incentives to enhance productivity domestically could work towards a better demand-supply balance over the medium-term. Pump prices of petroleum products have remained high. Reduction of excise duties and cesses and state level taxes could provide some relief to consumers on top of the recent easing of international crude prices. This could slow down the propagation of second- round effects. The impact of high international commodity prices and increased logistics costs are being felt across manufacturing and services. Finally, inflation expectations of urban households one year ahead showed a marginal increase than over the three months ahead horizon according to the Reserve Bank's March 2021 survey. Taking into consideration all these factors. CPI inflation is now projected as 5.0 per cent in Q4:2020- 21; 5.2 per cent in Q1:2021-22, 5.2 per cent in Q2, 4.4 per cent in Q3 and 5.1 per cent in Q4, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1). Turning to the growth outlook, rural demand remains buoyant and record agriculture production for 2020-21 bodes well for its resilience. Urban demand has been gaining strength on the back of normalisation of economic activity and should get a fillip with the ongoing vaccination drive. The fiscal stimulus from increased allocation for4 capital expenditure under the Union Budget 2021-22, expanded production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme and rising capacity utilisation (from 63.3 per cent in Q2 to 66.6 per cent in Q3:2020-21) should provide strong support to investment demand and exports. Firms engaged in manufacturing, services and infrastructure polled by the Reserve Bank in March 2021 were optimistic about a pick-up in demand and expansion in business activity into 2021-22. Consumer confidence, on the other hand, has dipped with the recent surge in COVID infections in some states imparting uncertainty to the outlook. Taking these factors into consideration, the projection of real GDP growth for 2021-22 is retained at 10.5 per cent consisting of 26.2 per cent in Q1, 8.3 per cent in Q2, 5.4 per cent in Q3 and 6.2 per cent in Q4 (Chart 2). The MPC notes that the supply side pressures on inflation could persist. It also notes that demand-side pull remains moderate. While cost-push pressures have risen, they could be partially offset with the normalisation of global supply chains. On imported inflation from global commodity prices, urgent concerted and coordinated policy actions by Centre and States can mitigate domestic input costs such as taxes on petrol and diesel and high retail margins. The renewed jump in COVID-19 infections in certain parts of the country and the associated localised lockdowns could dampen the demand for contact-intensive services, restrain growth impulses and prolong the return to normalcy. In such an environment, continued policy support remains necessary. Taking these developments into consideration, the MPC decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.5 9.

Poland,2021-04-07,"Warsaw, 7 April 2021 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 7 April 2021 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 0.10%; lombard rate at 0.50%; deposit rate at 0.00%; rediscount rate at 0.11%; discount rate at 0.12%. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. The timing and scale of the conducted measures will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. The recent period saw a worsening of epidemic developments in many countries. This translated into tightening of the pandemic-related restrictions that are negatively affecting economic activity, mainly in the service sector. At the same time, in many economies activity in industry continues to increase. Prices of many commodities, including oil, are currently significantly higher than a year ago. Such developments in commodity prices are exerting an upward pressure on global inflation. However, due to still weak economic conditions and uncertainty about the economic outlook, major central banks are keeping their interest rates low and are conducting asset purchases and signal maintaining loose monetary policy also in the future. Incoming data on economic developments in Poland indicate that industrial production continued to grow in February 2021 and sentiment in that sector improved as well. At the same time, a fall in construction and assembly output deepened and the annual change in retail sales  despite somewhat more optimistic consumers' sentiment  remained negative. This was accompanied by rising average employment in the enterprise sector, in month-on-month terms, and slowing average annual wage growth in this sector. According to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, inflation in March 2021 increased to 3.2% y/y. Increase in inflation was driven primarily by a further rise in fuel prices stemming from growing oil prices in the international markets. At the same time, the annual CPI has been pushed up by electricity prices that rose at the beginning of 2021 and by the earlier increases of waste disposal charges  thus by factors independent from the domestic monetary policy. The growing costs of running business amidst pandemic, including higher transport charges and temporary disruptions in supply chains, also continue to add to inflation. Statistical base effects related to fuel prices, together with the expected additional increases in waste disposal charges, will probably translate into a further rise in inflation in the coming months. At the same time, a progress in the vaccination programme and a gradual pacing out of the pandemic will ease the impact of supply-side factors  that are currently raising companies' cost  on inflation. Inflation will also be curbed by a lower wage pressure compared to the period before the pandemic. Similarly as many other countries. Poland witnessed a worsening of epidemic situation in March and a tightening of the pandemic-related restrictions. Such developments negatively affect economic activity and sentiments in some sectors, although high-frequency indicators show that the impact of the pandemic on the economy has been significantly weaker than before. Available data indicate that the coming quarters will see a recovery of economic activity, although the scale and pace of the recovery are uncertain. The further course of the pandemic and its impact on the economic situation in Poland and abroad continue to be the main source of uncertainty. The economic policy measures, including the easing of NBP's monetary policy introduced last year and the expected recovery in the global economy, will have a positive impact on the domestic economic situation. The pace of the economic recovery in Poland will also depend on further developments of the zloty exchange rate. These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in the secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In order to strengthen the impact of NBP's monetary policy easing on the economy. NBP may also intervene in the foreign exchange market. The timing and scale of the measures taken by NBP will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also continue to offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. NBP's monetary policy mitigates the negative economic impact of the pandemic, supports economic activity and stabilises inflation at the level consistent with the NBP's inflation target in the medium term. Due to its positive impact on the financial situation of debtors, it is also conducive to the strengthening of financial system stability."
Peru,2021-04-08,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT APRIL 2021 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation increased from 2.4 percent in February to 2.6 percent in March due to supply factors that led to higher prices of some goods. Trend inflation remains in the lower part of the target range. Year-on- year core inflation was 1.8 percent in March. Inflation is expected to remain within the target range throughout 2021 and 2022; and to lie at the lower part of the range during 2022, as economic activity will remain below its potential level. One-year ahead expected inflation was 2.2 percent in March. Leading indicators continued to recover in March and most firms' growth expectations are in optimistic territory. Global economic activity is expected to be more pronounced in next quarters as vaccination process continues around the world and significant stimulus packages are issued in United States. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows, and stands ready to expand monetary stimulus using a range of instruments. As of April 7. BCRP injection operations totaled S/ 58,408 million, of which S/ 49,830 million were associated with government- backed repos. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on May 13, 2021."
South Korea,2021-04-15,"The bank of korea. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period. Currently available information suggests that the recovery of the global economy has strengthened, supported by the economic stimulus in major countries and the expansion of vaccinations. In global financial markets, stock prices and government bond yields in major countries have increased, driven mainly by higher expectations for economic recovery. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by national policy responses and their effects. The recovery of the Korean economy has strengthened somewhat. Exports have sustained their buoyancy and facilities investment has continued to recover robustly, while the sluggishness in private consumption has eased. Labor market conditions have showed some signs of improvement, with the number of persons employed shifting to an increase compared to the corresponding period last year. Going forward, the economy is likely to continue its recovery, led by exports and investment. However, uncertainties surrounding the pace of recovery are judged to remain elevated. GDP growth this year is projected to be above the February forecast of 3.0%. Consumer price inflation has risen to the mid-1% level due to an increase in petroleum product prices as well as rising prices of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has moved up slightly within the mid-0% range. The inflation expectations of the general public have picked up to the lower-2% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will run above the path projected in February and fluctuate for some time at around 2%, before declining slightly. Core inflation is forecast to increase gradually to the 1% range. In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates and stock prices have risen, affected by global financial market movements and improvement of economic indicators. The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate rose slightly, largely reflecting the strengthening of the US dollar. Household loan growth has remained high, and housing prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. While the Korean economic recovery is expected to strengthen gradually, there is still a high level of uncertainty surrounding the path of COVID-19 and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to be modest. Thus, the Board will maintain its accommodative stance of monetary policy. In this process the Board will thoroughly assess developments related to COVID-19 as well as the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic, while paying attention to changes in financial stability conditions such as fund flows to asset markets and household debt growth."
Turkiye,2021-04-15,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 19 percent. The global economy, having contracted sharply in 2020 due to the pandemic, continues to recover on the back of accommodative policies and positive developments in the vaccination process. This improvement process is determined especially by the acceleration in manufacturing industry activity and global trade. While the upward trend in commodity prices has decelerated, the effects of the rising global inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant. Despite the constraining effect of the pandemic, domestic economic activity is strong, led by domestic and external demand. Manufacturing industry activity exhibits a strong momentum, whereas the weak course continues in the services sector, which has been adversely affected by the pandemic restrictions. Nevertheless, risks for economic activity exist in either direction depending on the progress of the pandemic and the vaccination process. Notwithstanding the rise in exports and the fall in gold imports, strong domestic demand and commodity prices continue to adversely affect the current account balance. While commercial loans exhibit a moderate course, an upward trend is observed in consumer loan growth despite tightening financial conditions. Demand and cost factors, supply constraints in some sectors, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook. The decelerating impact of the current monetary stance on credit and domestic demand is envisaged to become more significant in the upcoming period. Accordingly, the MPC has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance by keeping the policy rate unchanged. The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The policy rate will continue to be determined at a level above inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is reached. The stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and perpetual decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2021-04-15,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to raise the key policy rate by 1 pp, to 7.5% per annum. This step is aimed at gradually slowing down inflation in H2 2021 and returning it to the 5% target already in H1 2022. As expected, inflation deviated from the 5% Â± 1 pp target range in Q1 2021, but the deviation was greater than forecasted, mainly due to temporary factors. In March, consumer inflation accelerated to 8.5% yoy, while core inflation reached 5.9%. Inflation exceeded the NBU forecast published in the January 2021 Inflation Report. On the one hand, the steep rise in inflation was largely driven by temporary factors, such as growing global prices for food and energy. A revival in the global economy and the effects of smaller harvests continued to push up prices. A low comparison base also played an important role. On the other hand, underlying inflationary pressures increased due to sustained growth in consumer demand, which was, among other things, fueled by higher wages. Retail turnovers consistently exceeded pre-crisis levels, being 5.6% yoy larger in February. Inflation expectations remain high on the back of the rapid growth in the prices of goods consumed every day. Considering the fast-paced recovery of the global economy and higher inflationary pressures, the NBU revised its inflation forecast from 7% to 8% in 2021, expecting inflation to return to the 5% target in H1 2022 and settle at this level further on. However, it will reverse gradually as new harvest supplies come to the market, the effect of a low comparison base wanes for some products, and the NBU raises its key policy rate. Inflation will start to decelerate in autumn, return to its target range in H1 2022, and subsequently remain there. The Ukrainian economy is recovering, although slower than expected due to tightening of quarantine restrictions. Factoring in losses caused by the pandemic, the NBU revised downward its real GDP growth forecast for 2021, from 4.2% to 3.8%. The economy almost reached its pre-crisis level in Q4 2020, but its recovery slowed somewhat at the start of 2021. First, the introduction of new quarantine restrictions dampened business activity. Second, last year's smaller harvests affected the performance of agriculture, the food industry, and freight turnover. Third, increased competition in some global markets and greater trade restrictions imposed by Russia affected the industrial sector's performance, in spite of high prices on global commodity markets. Less favorable weather conditions in JanuaryFebruary weakened the performance of construction and transportation. At the same time, despite the lockdowns in red zones, the real economy is expected to grow as of end-March on the back of the low comparison base and actual improvement in businesses' performance. Taking these factors into account, the economy is projected to decline in annual terms in Q1. The Ukrainian economy will return to steady growth starting in Q2. Consumer demand will remain the main growth driver. Investment demand will also rise gradually as the global economy revives and more progress is made in overcoming the pandemic. However, the NBU downgraded its real GDP growth forecast for 2021 to 3.8%, down from 4.2%, mainly due to losses caused by the tightening and extension of quarantine restrictions. The Ukrainian economy will grow at a pace of around 4% in 20222023. In 2021, the current account will record a slight deficit, which will widen noticeably in 2022  2023 on the back of rising domestic demand and less favorable terms of trade. The current account is expected to return to a slight deficit of 0.8% of GDP in 2021, propelled by higher domestic demand and the gradual revival of international tourism. In 2022  2023, the current account deficit will widen noticeably, mainly due to less favorable terms of trade for exporters of agricultural and metallurgical products and the expected drop in earnings from gas transit. The deficit will also be driven by continued growth in consumer and investment imports, fueled by the complete recovery of the global and Ukrainian economies from the coronavirus crisis. As before, the primary assumption of the NBU Board is that Ukraine will continue to cooperate with the IMF. The NBU expects that Ukraine will make further progress in its talks with the IMF. Cooperation with the IMF and other international partners will enhance the government's ability to support the economy during the crisis, while also helping Ukraine pass through the period of debt repayments that will peak in the coming autumn. This cooperation will help maintain Ukraine's international reserves at a reasonably high level of USD 29 to 30 billion in 2021  2023. The key risk to the macroeconomic forecast is the imposition of stricter quarantine measures in Ukraine and globally, and the slow pace of the vaccination campaign domestically. New waves of the pandemic and new coronavirus strains forced countries to once again tighten quarantine restrictions in Q1 2021. Despite the partial adaptation of businesses to the new conditions, this is slowing the recovery of business activity. The slow pace of the vaccination campaign in Ukraine, coupled with higher inflationary pressures arising from the rebounding global economy, poses an additional risk of future economic losses. There are other significant risks. an escalation of the military conflict in eastern Ukraine or on the country's bordersvolatile global capital markets anda dramatic deterioration in the terms of trade. Given the above balance of risks and the increase in underlying inflationary pressures seen in recent months, the NBU Board decided to raise the key policy rate, to 7.5%. The NBU's baseline forecast envisages that the key policy rate will remain unchanged, at 7.5%, until the end of 2021. Given current inflationary movements, this should suffice to bring inflation back to its 5% target in H1 2022. However, if underlying inflationary pressures rise more noticeably than currently expected, and if inflation expectations worsen, there could be the need for further tighter monetary policy tightening. The NBU stands ready to continue raising its key policy rate to a level that will bring inflation back to its 5% target in H1 2022. The decision to increase the key policy rate, to 7.5%, was approved by an NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No. 142, dated 15 April 2021. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the central bank's Inflation Report on 22 April 2021.A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 26 April 2021. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 17 June 2021, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
Israel,2021-04-19,"The Israeli economy is recovering at a rapid pace, following the exit from the third lockdown. The effectiveness of the vaccination program has led to a sharp decline in morbidity rates, and has allowed a broad relaxation of the limitations on activity. The available indicators regarding economic activity in March were at the highest level since the beginning of the crisis. There was also a marked increase in activity in those industries that were particularly hard-hit by the limitations. The broad unemployment rate declined in the first half of March, to 12 percent. Data for the end of March and for April are expected to indicate a further decline in the broad-definition unemployment rate. According to the Business Tendency Survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics, there was a sharp increase in companies reporting difficulties in recruiting workers, together with a notable increase in reported job vacancies. The Research Department's staff forecast projects that GDP will grow by 6.3 percent in 2021. The broad unemployment rate is expected to decline to 7.5 percent by the end of 2021.In 2022, growth of 5 percent is expected, so that the level of GDP in 2022 is expected to be only approximately 1.4 percent lower than the level that had been expected prior to the crisis. The unemployment rate in 2022 is expected to continue to decline, to about 6 percent in the fourth quarter of the year: a level that is still higher than the precrisis level. The inflation environment remains low, but a moderate upward trend continues. The CPI increased by 0.6 percent in March, following an increase of 0.3 percent in the February CPI: both higher than expected: and inflation in the past 12 months is 0.2 percent. Inflation expectations for the coming year from all sources increased, and are at the lower bound of the inflation target range. Medium- and long-term inflation expectations are anchored within the target range. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate and against the euro, while it weakened by 0.4 percent against the dollar. The pace of issuance in the equity market remains high, and there was a sharp increase in capital raised in the venture capital industry in the first quarter. The credit market continues to function well, with stable and low interest rates, supported by a range of steps taken by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance. In February and March, for the first time since the crisis began, the average level of difficulty reported by companies in raising credit declined in all industries, other than hotels, and returned to the precrisis levels. The increase in the pace of vaccinations around the world is aiding the global economic recovery. The IMF revised its growth forecasts upward in all the main regions. World trade continues to grow, and its level is higher than it was prior to the crisis. The inflation rate increased in all the main regions, but the core indices remained lower than central banks' targets. Monetary policy at the major central banks remains very accommodative.  The opening of the economy and the return to normal life in Israel are expected to support continued rapid growth in the coming year. However, there are still challenges to economic activity in view of the health risks in Israel and abroad. The crisis's adverse effectson the economy, particularly the labor market, are expected to be prolonged. The Committee will therefore continue to conduct a very accommodative monetary policy fora prolonged time, using a range of tools as necessary, including the interest rate tool, in order to support the attainment of the policy targets and the recovery of the economy from the crisis, and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. For the file offigures accompanying this notice, click here. Israel's economy is recovering at a rapid pace following the exit from the third lockdown. The effectiveness of the vaccination program has led toa sharp decline in morbidity rates and has enabled a broader relaxation of the limitations on activity. The high vaccination rate among older age groups is reducing the risk of severe illness and a further wave of restrictions. Alongside this, there remains concern over the development of variants that are resistant to the vaccines or those that may cause more severe illness among the unvaccinated population. Such development poses a risk to the economy and to a return to normal routine. The available indicators regarding economic activity in March show that economic activity is at its highest level since the beginning of the crisis in March of last year, and initial indicators show that this trend has strengthened further in April. An examination of activity in industries that were significantly impacted by the restrictions (restaurants, tourism and leisure services, and education) shows that in these industries as well, there was a significant increase in activity (Figure 4). Moreover, credit card expenditure data indicate that the total value of purchases during the exit from the third lockdown was higher than its long-term (2016-19) trend line. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, the aggregate net balance of the business sector continues to increase from its low point of the second lockdown (Figure 2). While the prolonged upward trend of services exports continues, and their level is higher than prior to the crisis, foreign trade data indicate that goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds, in dollars), which were volatile throughout the crisis, have trended downward in recent months (Figure 6). Data on goods imports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds, in dollars) in March indicate a continued trend of accelerated growth (Figure 7). Alongside the increase in economic activity. Labor Force Survey data for the first half of March indicate a decline in the broad unemployment rate to 12 percent (Figure 8). Data for the end of March and April are expected to indicate a further decline in unemployment. In addition, according to the Business Tendency Survey by the Central Bureau of Statistics, there was a sharp increase in companies reporting difficulty in recruiting workers (<b>Figure 9). Alongside this, there was a marked increase in job vacancies reported (Figure 10). Despite the gradual return to employment, since some businesses have ceased to operate over the course of the year, and due to the remaining limitations and the implementation of efficiency and digitization measures that businesses have undertaken in the past year, it is expected to take a long time for the unemployment rate to return to its low precrisis levels. The government's policy regarding employment may also have an impact in this context. The Bank of Israel Research Department revised its macroeconomic forecast for the coming two years. Its assessment is that GDP will grow by 6.3 percent in 2021 (Figure 1). The level of GDP is expected to be higher than what was expected in the rapid vaccination scenario presented in the previous forecast. The broad unemployment rate is expected to decline to 7.5 percentof the labor force by the end of 2021. In 2022. GDP is expected to grow by 5 percent, so that the level of GDP in 2022 is expected to be only about 1.4 percent lower than the level expected before the crisis. The unemployment rate is expected to continue declining in 2022, to about 6 percent in the fourth quarter of the year, which is still higher than the precrisis rate. The debt to GDP ratio is expected to be 77 percent in each of the next two years. The inflation environment remains low but continues to trend moderately upward. The CPI for March increased by 0.6 percent, following an increase of 0.3 percent in February: both higher than expected. Inflation in thepast 12 months was 0.2 percent (0.2 percent net of energy and fruit and vegetables) (Figure 12). Against the background of the accommodative policy and the global inflation environment, inflation expectations for the coming year increased, and are around the lower bound of the target range (Figure 14). Medium- and long-term expectations are anchored within the target range (Figure 15). Since the previous interest rate decision, the exchange rate has generally been stable. The shekel strengthened by 1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate and against the euro, and weakened by 0.4 percent against the dollar (Figure 16). Home prices increased by 4 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 23), and investors' share of total transactions increased. At the same time, the pace of increase in rental prices remained moderate. New mortgage volume inMarch 2021 was NIS 8.6 billion, further to the high mortgage volumes since the beginning of the year, alongside the Bank of Israel directive relaxing the prime rate limitations for new borrowers and those refinancing their mortgages going into effect (Figure 24). Israel's equity market continued to rally. The pace of new issuance in the equity market remains high, and there was a sharp increase in capital raised in the venture capital industry in the first quarter (Figures 21-22). Ten-year government bond yields were stable. Corporate bond spreads continued to narrow, and are close to their precrisis levels (Figure 20). The credit market continues to function well with stable and low interest rates, supported by a range of steps taken by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance. According to the Business Tendency Survey, in February and March, for the first time since the beginning of the crisis, the average level of businesses' difficulty in obtaining credit declined, returning to precrisis levels in all industries except for hotels, where companies are still reporting relatively high levels of difficulty in obtaining financing (Figure 26). The increase in the pace of vaccinations around the world is aiding the recovery of the global economy. The IMF revised its growth forecasts upward for all the main regions, with the global economy expected to grow by about 6 percent in 2021 (Figure 28). The OECD expects that at the end of 2021, the US will be the only G 20 country where growth will reach, and even slightly surpass, the original growth path from 2019. Global output is expected to be about 3 percent lower than the precrisis forecast. World trade continues to grow, and is at a higher level than it was prior to the crisis (Figure 29). The global Purchasing Managers Index for March increased to a level that was last seen in 2018 (about 55 points), indicating a marked expansion of global activity in both the services and manufacturing components (Figure 30). In the capital markets, the upward trend in equity prices continued, with the major indices at record highs. Oil prices were volatile during the period, with a slight increase by the end of the period (Figure 32). Agricultural commodity and metal prices remained stable. The inflation rate increased inall the major blocs, but the core indices remained below central banks'targets. There was an increase in short-term inflation expectations, which is expected to moderate as a result of the moderation of the base effect. The US is leading a significant economic recovery as a result of the rapid distribution of vaccinations, a reduction of restrictions, and the launch of a fiscal program of significant scope: about 8.5 percent of GDP: alongside a planned tax reform that, if it is implemented, is expected to have a global impact. The fiscal program is expected to have a positive effect on the growth rate and on the labor market in the US, and is expected to encourage the continuation of the upward trend in inflation. In Europe, there is an increase in morbidity rates that has led the major countries in the eurozone to announce renewed lockdowns that are expected to have an impact on GDP growth in the first quarter of the year. China's economy is continuing its rapid recovery from the crisis. Retail sales and industrial production data indicate a sharp increase compared with the same months last year. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on May 3, 2021. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on M. The opening of the economy and the return to normal life in Israel are expected to support continued rapid growth in the coming year."
Euroarea,2021-04-22,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of the meeting of the Governing Council. While the recovery in global demand and the sizeable fiscal stimulus are supporting global and euro area activity, the near-term economic outlook remains clouded by uncertainty about the resurgence of the pandemic and the roll-out of vaccination campaigns. Persistently high rates of coronavirus (COVID-19) infection and the associated extension and tightening of containment measures continue to constrain economic activity in the short term. Looking ahead, progress with vaccination campaigns and the envisaged gradual relaxation of containment measures underpin the expectation of a firm rebound in economic activity in the course of 2021. Inflation has picked up over recent months on account of some idiosyncratic and temporary factors and an increase in energy price inflation. At the same time, underlying price pressures remain subdued in the context of significant economic slack and still weak demand. Preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period remains essential to reduce uncertainty and bolster confidence, thereby underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability. Euro area financing conditions have remained broadly stable recently after the increase in market interest rates earlier in the year, but risks to wider financing conditions remain. Against this background, the Governing Council decided to reconfirm its very accommodative monetary policy stance. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 per cent within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. We will continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of â¬1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. Since the incoming information confirmed the joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook carried out at the March monetary policy meeting, the Governing Council expects purchases under the PEPP over the current quarter to continue to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year. We will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy. If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation. We will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. Net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of â¬20 billion. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Finally, we will continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. In particular, the latest operation in the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO has registered a high take-up of funds. The funding obtained through TLTRO III plays a crucial role in supporting bank lending to firms and households. These measures help to preserve favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy and thereby underpin economic activity and safeguard medium-term price stability. We will also continue to monitor developments in the exchange rate with regard to their possible implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards our aim in a sustained manner, in line with our commitment to symmetry. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP declined by 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020 to stand 4.9 per cent below its pre-pandemic level one year earlier. Incoming economic data, surveys and high-frequency indicators suggest that economic activity may have contracted again in the first quarter of this year, but point to a resumption of growth in the second quarter. Business surveys indicate that the manufacturing sector continues to recover, supported by solid global demand. At the same time, restrictions on mobility and social interaction still limit activity in the services sector, although there are signs of a bottoming-out. Fiscal policy measures continue to support households and firms, but consumers remain cautious in view of the pandemic and its impact on employment and earnings. Despite weaker corporate balance sheets and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook, business investment has shown resilience. Looking ahead, the progress with vaccination campaigns, which should allow for a gradual relaxation of containment measures, should pave the way for a firm rebound in economic activity in the course of 2021. Over the medium term the recovery of the euro area economy is expected to be driven by a recovery in domestic and global demand, supported by favourable financing conditions and fiscal stimulus. Overall, while the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook over the near term continue to be on the downside, medium-term risks remain more balanced. On the one hand, better prospects for global demand  bolstered by the sizeable fiscal stimulus  and the progress with vaccination campaigns are encouraging. On the other hand, the ongoing pandemic, including the spread of virus mutations, and its implications for economic and financial conditions continue to be sources of downside risk. Euro area annual inflation increased to 1.3% in March 2021, from 0.9% in February, on account of a strong increase in energy price inflation that reflected both a sizeable upward base effect and a month-on-month increase. This increase more than offset decreases in food price inflation and in HICP inflation excluding energy and food. Headline inflation is likely to increase further in the coming months, but some volatility is expected throughout the year reflecting the changing dynamics of idiosyncratic and temporary factors. These factors can be expected to fade out of annual inflation rates early next year. Underlying price pressures are expected to increase somewhat this year, owing to short-term supply constraints and the recovery in domestic demand, although they remain subdued overall, in part reflecting low wage pressures, in the context of economic slack, and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate. Once the impact of the pandemic fades, the unwinding of the high level of slack, supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, will contribute to a gradual increase in inflation over the medium term. Survey-based measures and market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remain at subdued levels, although market-based indicators have continued their gradual increase. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of broad money (M3) stood at 12.3 per cent in February 2021, after 12.5 per cent in January. Strong money growth continued to be supported by the ongoing asset purchases by the Eurosystem, as the largest source of money creation. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 has remained the main contributor to broad money growth, consistent with a still heightened preference for liquidity in the money-holding sector and a low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid forms of money. Overall, lending to the private sector remained broadly unchanged. The monthly lending flow to non-financial corporations showed a modest pick-up in February compared with the previous month. This was also reflected in a slightly higher annual growth rate of 7.1 per cent, after 6.9 per cent in January. Monthly lending flows to households continued to be solid with the annual growth rate of loans to households remaining unchanged at 3.0 per cent in February. The latest euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2021 reports a moderate tightening of credit standards for loans to firms, following more significant tightening in the previous two quarters. Heightened risk perceptions among banks were again the main contributor to the tightening, although their impact was less pronounced than in previous survey rounds. Surveyed banks also reported a renewed fall in demand for loans to firms, mainly driven by a continued decline in demand for financing for fixed investment. With regard to lending to households, the survey indicated lower demand for loans for house purchase, while the credit standards for these loans eased slightly, supported by competition among lenders. Overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments and other European institutions, remain essential to support bank lending conditions and access to financing, in particular for those most affected by the pandemic. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary to support economic activity and the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 per cent over the medium term. Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains crucial, as premature withdrawal of fiscal support would risk delaying the recovery and amplifying the longer-term scarring effects. National fiscal policies should thus continue to provide critical and timely support to the firms and households most exposed to the ongoing pandemic and the associated containment measures. At the same time, fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should, as much as possible, remain temporary and targeted in nature to address vulnerabilities effectively and to support a swift recovery of the euro area economy. The three safety nets endorsed by the European Council for workers, businesses and governments provide important funding support. The Governing Council reiterates the key role of the Next Generation EU package and the urgency of it becoming operational without delay. It calls on Member States to ensure a timely ratification of the Own Resources Decision, to finalise their recovery and resilience plans promptly and to deploy the funds for productive public spending, accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural policies. This would allow the Next Generation EU programme to contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery and would increase economic resilience and the growth potential of Member Statesâ economies, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. Such structural policies are particularly important in improving economic structures and institutions and in accelerating the green and digital transitions."
Russia,2021-04-23,"On 23 April 2021, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to increase the key rate by 50 bp to 5.00% per annum. Consumer price growth rates as well as inflation expectations of households and businesses remain elevated. The recovery of demand is becoming increasingly steady and in certain sectors exceeds their output expansion capacity. In this context, the balance of risks is shifted towards proinflationary ones. The Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2021 has been increased to 4.75.2%. The rapid recovery of demand and elevated inflationary pressure call for an earlier return to neutral monetary policy. The Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further increases in the key rate at its upcoming meetings. The key rate decisions will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will return to the Bank of Russia's target in the middle of 2022 and will remain close to 4% further on. Inflation dynamics. Inflation continues to develop above the Bank of Russia's forecast. In March, the annual consumer price growth rate rose to 5.8% (vs 5.7% in February). According to estimates as of 19 April, annual inflation slowed down to 5.5%. However, this is related to the high base effect of April 2020. Based on Bank of Russia's estimates, indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements rose in March and substantially exceed 4% (annualised). This largely reflects a steady nature of the recovery in domestic demand. Its influence on price growth rates is enhanced by supply-side restrictions and the elevated pressure from businesses' costs. Amid the restrictions on foreign travels, the funds that households have been unable to spend for this purpose are partially redistributed in favour of domestic goods and services consumption. Inflation expectations of households remain elevated compared to the pre-pandemic period. Businesses' price expectations have grown. Analysts' medium-term expectations are anchored close to 4%. The rapid recovery of demand and elevated inflationary pressure call for an earlier return to neutral monetary policy. The Bank of Russia forecasts that the annual consumer price growth rates in the second quarter will be close to their first quarter values. Annual inflation is forecast to slow down steadily in the second half of 2021. Inflation will be in the range of 4.75.2% as of the end of 2021. Given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will return to the Bank of Russia's target in the middle of 2022 and will remain close to 4% further on. Monetary conditions remain accommodative and have not seen any significant changes since the previous meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors. Yields of medium- and long-term OFZs remain near their late-March levels, reflecting the expectations of the Bank of Russia's return to neutral monetary policy and the movements of interest rates in global financial markets. Lending continues to grow at rates close to recent years' highs. The Bank of Russia's decisions to increase the key rate and the rise in OFZ yields observed since the beginning of the year will create the prerequisites for the growth in loan and deposit rates in the future. This will make it possible to raise the attractiveness of bank deposits for households, protect the purchasing power of savings, and ensure balanced lending expansion. Economic activity. The pace of economic recovery is becoming increasingly steady. At the end of the first quarter, retail turnover approached its pre-pandemic level. The household services sector is actively recovering. This is facilitated by the consistent lifting of restrictive measures and gradual vaccination. According to the Bank of Russia's monitoring, over a half of the surveyed companies have reported that the demand for their products has recovered or exceeded the pre-pandemic levels. Investment demand recovery is ongoing. In certain sectors, the capacity for output expansion is lagging behind the expanding demand, including due to lack of labour force. The unemployment is declining. Economic recovery is also supported by external demand which continues to grow despite the still complex epidemic conditions in the world. The Bank of Russia forecasts the growth rate of the Russian economy in 2021 in the range of 3.04.0%. It means that the Russian economy will return to its pre-crisis level in the second half of 2021. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast. GDP in 20222023 is set to grow 2.53.5% and 2.03.0% respectively. The medium-term path of economic growth will largely depend both on domestic and external conditions. Domestic demand movements will be predominantly shaped by the rate of growth in private demand. Consumer demand will be supported by a decline in households' propensity to save along with an increase in incomes and lending. Domestic demand will be also influenced by the process of fiscal policy normalisation in view of the announced additional social and infrastructure measures. External demand movements will be mostly dependent on fiscal support measures taken in individual advanced economies as well as the pace of vaccination world-wide. Inflation risks. The balance of risks is shifted towards proinflationary risks. The impact of proinflationary factors may be more prolonged and pronounced amid an outrunning growth of consumer demand compared to the capacity of output expansion. Their effect may be also strengthened by elevated inflation expectations and corresponding secondary effects. Further upward pressure on prices may continue to come from temporary disruptions in production and supply chains. Proinflationary risks are generated by price movements in global commodity markets, including supply-side factors. This may pass through to domestic prices for corresponding goods. At the same time, further movements of food prices will largely depend on the agricultural harvest prospects both in Russia and abroad. Short-term proinflationary risks are also associated with the stronger volatility in global markets caused in part by various geopolitical developments, which may affect exchange rate and inflation expectations. Also, given that the global economic recovery is progressing at faster paces than previously expected and the need is no longer in place for unprecedentedly accommodative policies in advanced economies, an earlier monetary policy normalisation in these countries is possible. This may become a further driver of volatility growth in global financial markets. Disinflationary risks for the baseline scenario remain moderate. Opening up the borders concurrently with a gradual lifting of restrictions may lead to a recovery in the consumption of foreign services and weaken supply-side constraints in the labour market owing to an inflow of foreign labour force. The economic recovery may be held back, among other things, by low vaccination rates and the spread of new coronavirus strains, as well as the ensuing tightening of restrictions. Medium-term inflation is largely influenced by fiscal policy. In its baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia proceeds from the fiscal policy normalisation path stipulated by the Guidelines for Fiscal. Tax and Customs and Tariff Policy for 2021 and the 20222023 Planning Period, which implies a return to the fiscal rule parameters in 2022. The Bank of Russia will factor in the impact of possible decisions on investing the liquid part of the National Wealth Fund in excess of the threshold level set at 7% of GDP on the forecast. The Bank of Russia estimates that the implementation of additional social and infrastructure measures announced in the Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly in April will not exert any considerable proinflationary effect. The Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further increases in the key rate at its upcoming meetings. The key rate decisions will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 11 June 2021. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting of 23 April 2021 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast. Statement by Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina in follow-up to Board of Directors meeting 23 April 2021. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Kazakhstan,2021-04-26,"Press Release 7 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.00% April 26, 2021 Nur-Sultan The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to set the base rate at 9.00% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/ 1.0 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities is to be set on 10.00% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 8.00%. The decision was stipulated by the persisting effects of the pro-inflationary factors, despite a slight slowdown of actual inflation. Risks of increasing prices are associated with rising electricity tariffs, growing gasoline prices, clarifying the parameters of the state budget, continuing growth in external prices for food products, accelerating inflation in trading partner countries and the increased likelihood of a worsening situation with COVID-19 in the world due to emerging problems with vaccination. The domestic sector demonstrates signs of recovery in business activity, indicating a gradual revival in demand, which contributes to the growth of real money incomes of the population. The dynamics of annual inflation is formed below the National Bank's expectations. At the end of March 2021, annual inflation rate decreased to 7.0% compared to 7.4% in February and January 2021. The food component continues to make a major contribution to inflation, despite a slowdown in annual growth rates of prices from 11.6% in February to 10.7% in March 2021. In the structure of food commodities, a deceleration in the annual growth rates of prices for most of the food products is observed, which is considerably explained by the high base of 2020, when a significant increase in prices was marked due to increased demand and a break in supply chains. However, the annual price growth for certain goods (sunflower oil, eggs) continues. The inflation in the non-food component accelerated from 5.2% in February 2021 to 5.6% in March 2021. This is particularly due to higher prices for footwear, clothing and gasoline. Previously, these goods had the main restraining effect on non-food inflation. A decrease in the growth rate of prices is observed for paid services. Inflation of this component slowed down from 4.2% in December 2020 to 3.7% in March 2021. The main factors of the decline were the annual deflation on regulated utilities and the deceleration in annual growth rates for rental housing and transportation services. Various estimates of core inflation indicate the formation of inflationary processes predominantly above the target band. The economy is still experiencing high price growth for certain food products, and the dynamics of price growth for some non-food products and services may indicate a gradual recovery in consumer demand. An increase in inflationary expectations is observed. In March 2021, the quantitative estimate of inflation for the year ahead comprised 6.9% (6.7% in February 2021). The share of respondents expecting continued growth or more rapid price increases over the next 12 months increased to 44% (42% in February 2021). The situation in the domestic economy is gradually improving and developing in accordance with the forecasts of the National Bank (growth by 3.4-3.7% in 2021). The economy of Kazakhstan in the first quarter of 2021 contracted by 1.6% in annual terms. After the decline in GDP in January, the pace of economic contraction slowed in February. In March, the dynamics of GDP passed into the growth zone. Manufacturing, construction, information and communications, agriculture and the public sector demonstrated stable growth. The main negative contribution to the GDP dynamics was made by the mining industry, trade and transport. The results of a survey of enterprises by the National Bank also indicate an improvement in sentiment in the real sector. In March 2021, the PMI exceeded 50 for the first time since the beginning of 2020, reaching 50.6. The recovery of economic activity is observed in industry and service sector. In construction, the downward trend in business activity continued, the indicator dropped by 0.9 points. Enterprises also note an improvement in the business environment. In January-February 2021, real incomes of the population demonstrated positive dynamics and increased by 3.3%. The growth in income was driven by continued growth in real wages and pensions. The situation in the external sector remains uncertain. Due to ongoing vaccinations and additional financial support measures, stronger than previously predicted global economic growth is expected in a number of countries. The IMF raised its forecasts for global economic growth in 2021 from 5.5% to 6.0%, including among the economies of the trading partner countries of Kazakhstan: in the EU - from 4.2% to 4.4%, in China - from 8.1% to 8.4%, in Russia - from 3.0% to 3.8%. Meanwhile, compared with the October estimate, the IMF revised the growth of the economy of Kazakhstan in 2021 from 3.0% to 3.2%. Manufacture industry remains one of the main drivers of growth. Even though, the risks of a slower recovery in global demand still persist owing to the unstable epidemiological situation in the world and the emergence of new strains of the virus, accelerating inflation in developed countries, as well as increasing geopolitical tensions. Prices continue to rise on the world food markets. The FAO food price index rose for the tenth month in a row and in March 2021 was 118.5 points, reaching the highest value since June 2014. This is stipulated by the rise in the price of vegetable oils, meat and dairy products. In the countries-trading partners of Kazakhstan, the acceleration of inflationary processes is observed. In China, after two months of deflation, price growth resumed. At the end of March 2021, annual inflation was 0.4%. In the EU, price growth accelerated to 1.7% in March 2021. In Russia, as a result of increased inflationary pressure under expanding demand, annual inflation accelerated and formed at the level of 5.8%. Due to the growing inflationary pressures, the central banks of certain developing countries, including Russia. Turkey. Brazil, and Ukraine, tightened monetary conditions in March 2021. Since the beginning of the year, the Central Bank of Russia has twice raised the key rate from 4.25% to 5.0%. The current situation in the world oil market is improving with the support of global vaccination programs and incentive packages in key countries. The price of Brent oil has been held above $62 per barrel since the beginning of April 2021. An additional supporting factor is the oil shortage formation caused by accelerated consumption. Given the rapid recovery in consumption, international organizations slightly adjusted their forecasts upward. According to EIA estimates, the average annual price for Brent oil in 2021 will be $62.3 per barrel, in 2022 - $60.5 per barrel. The main risks of the oil market development future are 2 related to the further dynamics of the COVID-19 incidence rates, the pace of increasing OPEC+ production and the potential increase in exports from Iran. Given the external and internal inflation risks, the further slowdown in annual inflation may occur at a slower pace. The expected increase in electricity tariffs and the increase in expenditures of the republican budget mainly on account of the allocation of an additional target transfer from the National Fund for 850 billion tenge are new conditions for the forecast and require an assessment of the impact on the inflation trajectory in the short and medium term. The next decision on the base rate will be made on the results of the upcoming forecast round ""May-June 2021"" and rested on updated inflation forecasts and other macroeconomic indicators, as well as the risks balance. The next planned decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on June 2021 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time.

Hungary,2021-04-27,"At its meeting on 27 April 2021, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 28 April 2021:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy. Global macroeconomic and financial market developments continue to be primarily driven by the events related to the coronavirus pandemic. The timing of the reopening largely depends on the course of the third wave of the pandemic and the population's vaccination coverage rate. However, vaccination has progressed more slowly than expected in most countries, and consequently there remains an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty surrounding the pace of global economic recovery. World trade and global industrial production are already above the levels seen in January 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, the outlook for growth in the United States improved and Chinese economic growth continued. The euro area's economic performance declined in the first quarter, and therefore the recovery will take longer than previously expected. In the past month, risk appetite has been driven by developments related to the coronavirus pandemic and global reflation concerns. After a significant increase at the beginning of the year, there was a slight reversal in developed market yields. Since the beginning of 2021, commodity prices have risen significantly, and global oil prices have remained around USD 65. The European Central Bank continued its asset purchase programmes, and decision-makers indicated that more purchases will be made under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) in the second quarter of 2021. In the CEE region, the Czech and the Polish central bank have left policy rates unchanged since the Council's previous interest rate decision. As a result of the protracted economic recovery, loose monetary conditions are expected to be maintained by the world's leading and regional central banks over the longer term; however, decision-makers disagree as to the time frame over which emergency asset purchase programmes should operate. The Hungarian economy proved to be crisis-resilient to the second wave of the pandemic. The effects of strict lockdowns due to the third wave are expected to be less severe on the real economy than those of the first wave. With the restrictive measures remaining in effect and the interruptions in production chains, the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic is expected to cause a decline in GDP in the first quarter of 2021. In February, construction output declined; however, industrial production already exceeded the level before the crisis, and it moved closer to the trend seen before the pandemic. Although the volume of retail sales declined, households' confidence indicators and the real net wage bill, which is important in terms of consumption expenditure, grew further at the beginning of the year. The vaccination coverage rate of Hungary's population is at the top in the European Union; therefore, restrictive measures started to be lifted gradually. In parallel, the recovery in the services sector's performance may also begin. In terms of demand and supply, the Hungarian economy exhibits the potential for a rapid recovery. Throughout 2020, the business investment rate stood at a high level, at 27.3 percent, while the unemployment rate remained low compared to international levels. Credit markets continued to expand strongly even in international comparison. The recovery in demand has been driven by an increase in household income, a pick-up in government and private investment and the accelerating withdrawal of EU funds. GDP is expected to grow by between 4.0 and 6.0 percent in 2021, by between 5.0 and 6.0 percent in 2022 and by 3.5 percent in 2023. Domestic demand may pick up as progress is made in vaccination and in the opening of the economy. Continued growth in investment is key to the economic recovery. The financing environment remains supportive, in which the Bank's FGS Go! and the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme play a key role. In addition to the current, ongoing capacity improvements, growth in corporate investment is supported by new development projects financed by foreign direct investments. Household investment, in turn, has been stimulated by the Government's housing allowance programmes. In the coming years. Hungary's economic performance is likely to improve to a greater extent than the European Union's average, and therefore real economic convergence is expected to continue. In March 2021, annual inflation was 3.7 percent, core inflation was 3.9 percent and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects stood at 3.1 percent. Inflation rose by 0.6 percentage points and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects fell by 0.3 percentage points relative to the previous month. The rise in inflation primarily reflected an increase in fuel prices, which accounted for 0.8 percentage points of the pick-up in inflation in March. Inflation is likely to be highly volatile in the coming months. In analysing longer-term trends, the MNB places great emphasis on the assessment of underlying indicators, especially core inflation excluding indirect tax effects. In the coming months, spikes in inflation will occur due to base effects, rising fuel prices, a further increase in excise duties and demand-supply frictions as the economy restarts. The consumer price index will approach 5 percent in the second quarter. Rising fuel prices and tax changes account for about half of this level. Inflation is likely to return to the central bank tolerance band from the summer months as temporary effects fade. In 2021, annual average inflation is expected to be in the range of 3.83.9 percent and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects will be around the 3 percent level. Spikes in inflation are mainly caused by supply-side and cost factors. With inflation expectations anchored, we do not expect second-round effects according to our baseline scenario. Fading temporary effects, unused capacity in the economy and the moderate external inflation environment are expected to contribute to a decline in domestic prices from the first quarter of 2022. As a result, inflation is expected to stabilise around the central bank target again. The MNB lays special emphasis on developments in inflation expectations following the restart of the economy, and on the neutralisation of potential second-round effects. The three large credit-rating agencies confirmed that Hungary has a relatively strong economic performance and recovery potential, as well as a solid debt repayment ability. According to the April EDP notification, the accrual-based government deficit was 8.1 percent of GDP in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, but it may decline again from this year. After falling steadily since 2011, gross government debt increased temporarily to over 80 percent of GDP in 2020; however, it is likely to shift to a downward path from this year as economic growth is restored and the deficit declines. Debt financing has been stable, strongly supported by domestic savings. The MNB has raised Hungary's gold reserves from 31.5 tons to 94.5 tons, thereby strengthening confidence further in the country. Outstripping expectations, the current account was in a surplus in 2020. The country's current account balance is expected to improve further in the coming years, driven by the recovery in external demand and the gradual increase in the output of new capacities. With the capital account strongly in surplus. Hungary's net lending is expected to improve significantly and Hungary's net external debt to continue to fall further. In response to the adverse economic effects arising from the coronavirus pandemic, the MNB expanded significantly the central bank balance sheet in 2020. The Monetary Council continues to be ready to manage risks arising from the coronavirus pandemic and to foster the quick and sustainable recovery of economic growth in a targeted way. At its meeting today, the Monetary Council performed the revision of its government securities purchase programme. In the Monetary Council's assessment, even during the third wave of the pandemic and in a volatile international financial market environment, the programme has been successful. The purchases by the Bank have contributed to maintaining a stable liquidity position in the government securities market and improved the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. The MNB will continue to use its government securities purchase programme by maintaining a lasting presence in the market, taking a flexible approach to changing the structure of weekly securities purchases, to the extent and for the time necessary. The Council will still not set a total amount for its government securities purchase programme. In addition to continuously monitoring the implementation of the asset purchase programme, the Monetary Council will perform the next revision when stocks reach HUF 3,000 billion. The FGS Go! and the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme remain key in the process of economic recovery. The MNB will continue to sterilise the resulting surplus liquidity issued under the programmes in full, using the preferential deposit instrument. At its meeting today, the Monetary Council left the base rate and the overnight deposit rate unchanged at 0.60 percent and -0.05 percent, respectively, and the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates at 1.85 percent. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at weekly tenders, in response to the increase in risk aversion vis-a-vis emerging markets. The Bank will maintain the difference between the base rate and the one-week deposit rate as long as warranted by inflationary risks. It is a key priority for the MNB that short-term rates in every sub-market and at all times should develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. Therefore, similarly to previous quarters, the MNB held foreign exchange swap tenders providing euro liquidity at the end of March, thereby successfully contributing to maintaining the stability of monetary conditions. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the increase in risk aversion vis-a-vis emerging markets and potential second-round effects following the restart of the economy pose the greatest risk in terms of the outlook for inflation. By contrast, the protraction of the pandemic threatens a quick economic recovery and points to a lower inflation path than projected in the baseline scenario. The MNB continues to be committed to maintaining price stability even during the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. It is the MNB's clear intention to prevent the current uncertain environment from causing a sustained rise in inflation. The Council closely monitors developments in investors' risk appetite in emerging markets and potential second-round inflationary effects resulting from the restart of the economy. The Monetary Council reiterates that if warranted by an increase in upside risks to inflation, the MNB will be ready to use the appropriate instruments."
Egypt,2021-04-28,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release April 28th, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 825 percent, 925 percent, and 875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 875 percen. Annual headline urban inflation stabilized at 45 percent in March and February 2021, after registering 43 percent in January 202. The stabilization in the annual headline inflation rate came due to the combined effect of the higher annual contribution of food items, and the lower annual contribution of non-food item. Annual food inflation increased in March 2021 after remaining stable in February 2021, reflecting higher annual contribution of volatile food items as well as core food items, but by a lesser extent, in line with their seasonal pattern. Meanwhile annual non-food inflation declined, supported by broadly stable prices in March 2021 as well as favorable base effect. In the meantime, annual core inflation inched up slightly to 37 percent in March 2021 from 36 percent in February 202. Real GDP growth recorded a preliminary figure of 20 percent during 2020 Q4, up from 07 percent during the previous quarte. Moreover some leading indicators point towards a resumption of recovery towards their pre-pandemic level. Meanwhile the unemployment rate stabilized at 72 percent during 2020 Q4 compared to 73 percent during the previous quarte. Global economic activity continues to display signs of recovery and resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit with varying paces across countries and economic sector. Prospects for global economic recovery remain contingent on the development of the pandemic, and the efficacy, availability and scale of distribution of vaccine. Global economic and financial conditions are expected to remain accommodative and supportive of economic activity over the medium ter. Meanwhile international food and other commodity prices have continued to rise, as international oil prices remained elevated relative to their post-pandemic level. The changes in international oil prices were driven by demand and supply side developments, which continue to weigh on their future price trajectorie. Against this background, the MPC decided that keeping policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 7 percent (Â±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandat.

Georgia,2021-04-28,"28.04.21 The National Bank of Georgia raises the monetary policy rate by 1 percentage point to 9.50 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on April 28, 2021, and decided to raise the refinancing rate by 1 percentage point to 9.50 percent. Annual inflation stood at 7.2 percent in March. The reduction of inflation since last December was related to the subsidization of utility fees, which was of a temporary nature. The end of this subsidy in March 2021 was reflected in the upward shift of inflation. It is noteworthy that the subsidy will also have a base effect with a significant upward impact on the annual inflation rate in December 2021 and January-February 2022. Given the changed circumstances since the previous meeting, according to the updated forecast, other things being equal, inflation will average around 6.5 percent in 2021 and then gradually approach the target. The forecast for economic growth is about 4 percent in the baseline scenario. Inflation pressures, coming from rising prices on international commodity markets, persists, being reflected in the increased prices for oil products and selected food items. At the same time, on the back of a big drop in output due to the pandemic, the average production costs are still high, being another source for the upward pressure on inflation. The Committee also took into account that the recent developments in the trading partner economies have, to some extent, also been transferred to the local foreign exchange market. Given the high dollarization of the economy, this puts even more pressure on prices. Moreover, there is high uncertainty remaining about the prospects of the tourism industry in Georgia as well as globally. Amid deteriorating epidemiological conditions, the fiscal deficit remains at high level, pushing domestic demand up. As for the lending, despite the recent slowdown, as a result of maintaining adequate buffers of liquidity in the financial sector, it continues to grow fairly. Overall, the increase in domestic demand boosts imports. In view of prolonged deviation of inflation from its target and intensified inflationary pressures, the Committee decided to increase the monetary policy rate by 1 percentage point. A possible further tightening of monetary policy will depend on inflation expectations and the dynamics of factors affecting it. According to the preliminary data, there are signs of recovery in the aggregate demand. Based on rapid estimates, economic activity fell by 5.1 percent year-on-year in February, while, amid easing of restrictions since the start of the year, a gradual recovery of economic activity is expected from March, the main driver of which will be domestic demand. In contrast, external demand remains significantly reduced compared to the pre-pandemic situation. As for the current indicators, exports of goods increased by 31 percent in March, which is partly due to the base effect. At the same time, revenues from international travelers is down by 60 percent year-on-year in March, while the drop since the same period in 2019 amounts to 88 percent. As for imports of goods, an annual growth of 18 percent was recorded in March. Based on the abovementioned factors, it is clear that the pressure on inflation coming from high dollarization and the exchange rate is still strong. In addition to limiting the efficiency of monetary policy, dollarization also carries risks of financial stability, and thus its gradual reduction remains a long-term priority of the NBG. For this purpose, starting from July, the minimum reserve requirements for funds attracted in foreign currency will be determined individually, for each commercial bank, according to the deposit dollarization of each bank. In particular, unless the deposit dollarization rate exceeds 40 percent, the reserve requirement norm will be reduced from 25 to 10 percent for funds borrowed in a foreign currency and with a remaining maturity of up to 1 year. If the deposit dollarization is 70 percent or above, reserve requirements will still be 25 percent. Finally, for the deposit dollarization in the range of 40-70 percent, the reserve requirement norm will decrease linearly from 25 to 10 percent along with a decrease in the deposit dollarization. Similarly, the reserve requirement will be reduced from 15 to 10 percent for foreign currency-denominated funds with a remaining maturity of 1 to 2 years. This change will help to intensify competition in the GEL deposit market, gradually increase the demand for GEL and ease the pressure on the foreign exchange market. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on June 23, 2021."
United States,2021-04-28,"EDT April 28, 2021 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations. The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on the economy, and risks to the economic outlook remain. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT April 28, 2021assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C. Williams. Vice Chair; Thomas I Barkin; Raphael W Bostic; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H Clarida; Mary C Daly; Charles L Evans; Randal K. Quarles; and Christopher J Waller."
Colombia,2021-04-30,"Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). Read the Board of Director's considerations to hold the benchmark interest rate at its April meeting. Banco de la Republica's board of directors (BDBR) in its meeting on April 30 voted 6-1 to hold the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%. This majority decision was based on the following considerations. The technical staff's central GDP growth forecast for 2021 was revised upward from 5.2% to 6%, driven by better-than-expected economic performance in the first quarter. However, additional outbreaks of COVID-19 of unknown intensity and duration, as well as uncertainty surrounding fiscal conditions, could affect this projection. Total annual inflation at the end of March was 1.51%, while inflation excluding food and regulated items was 0.94%. Both market expectations and the technical staff's inflation forecast are in line with a convergence to the 3% target in 2021 and 2022. Colombia's national statistics agency (DANE) registered the overall national unemployment rate in March at 14.2%, alongside a monetary poverty rate of 42.5% for 2020. This high level of unemployment and rising poverty rate provide grounds for the current, historically low policy interest rate. International financial conditions continue to be loose but are likely to grow less favorable as the result of a highly expansive fiscal policy in the United States. Public financing costs and access could become compromised without an adequate fiscal adjustment, an outcome that would limit the space for monetary policy to continue supporting recovery in economic activity and employment. In considering these circumstances and the general balance of risks, the BDBR voted 6-1 to hold the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%, with one dissenting vote in favor of a 25-basis point reduction.

Brazil,2021-05-05,"In its 238th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate to 3.50% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Regarding the global outlook, new fiscal stimuli in some developed countries and the advancement of the COVID-19 immunization programs should promote a more robust economic recovery throughout the year. Economic slack and central bank communication from major economies suggest monetary stimuli will last long. However, market discussion regarding inflationary risks in these economies could result in a more challenging environment for emerging economies. Turning to the Brazilian economy, recent indicators are evolving better than expected in spite of the second wave of the pandemic being more intense than anticipated. Prospectively, uncertainty about economic growth still remains larger than usual, but should gradually return to its normal level. With the exception of oil, commodity prices continued to increase, impacting food and industrial price forecasts. Additionally, the transition to higher energy prices should keep inflation under pressure in the short run. The Committee maintains the diagnosis that the current shocks are temporary, but continues to closely monitor its evolution. The various measures of underlying inflation are at the top of the range compatible with meeting the inflation target. Inflation expectations for 2021, 2022, and 2023 collected by the Focus survey are around 5.0%, 3.6%, and 3.25%, respectively; and. The Copom's inflation projections in its baseline scenario, with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and exchange rate starting at R$5.40/US$* and evolving according to the purchase power parity (PPP), stand around 5.1% for 2021 and 3.4% for 2022. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2021 at 5.50% p.a. and rises to 6.25% p.a. in 2022. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 8.4% for 2021 and 5.0% for 2022. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, economic recovery from the pandemic can be slower than estimated, producing a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, further extensions of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that aggravate the fiscal path, or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda, may add pressure to the country's risk premium. The elevated fiscal risk creates an upward asymmetry in the balance of risks, i.e., in the direction of higher-than-expected paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The Committee reiterates that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 0.75 p.p. to 3.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2022. Without compromising its fundamental objective of price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment. At this moment, the Copom's baseline scenario indicates that a partial normalization of the policy rate remains appropriate to keep some degree of monetary stimulus during the economic recovery. However, the Committee emphasizes that there is no commitment with this plan, and that future steps of monetary policy could be adjusted to assure the achievement of the inflation target. For the next meeting the Committee foresees the continuation of the partial normalization process with another adjustment of the same magnitude in the degree of monetary stimulus. The Copom emphasizes that its view will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and inflation projections and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fabio Kanczuk. Fernanda Feitosa Nechio. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Poland,2021-05-05,"Warsaw, 5 May 2021 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 5 May 2021 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 0.10%; lombard rate at 0.50%; deposit rate at 0.00%; rediscount rate at 0.11%; discount rate at 0.12%. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. The timing and scale of the conducted measures will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. In the recent period pandemic situation worldwide was diversified and in many European countries it remained difficult. In many euro area countries the number of new cases was still elevated, but at the end of April it started to slightly decrease. Pandemic- related restrictions were still negatively affecting activity in the service sector in some European economies. At the same time, economic indicators suggested a further recovery in manufacturing sector coupled with emergence of supply bottlenecks in some markets. Prices of many commodities, including oil, are currently significantly higher than a year ago. Such developments in commodity prices together with supply disruptions related to the pandemic are exerting an upward pressure on global inflation. However, due to still weak economic conditions and uncertainty about the economic outlook, major central banks are keeping their interest rates low and are conducting asset purchases and signal maintaining loose monetary policy also in the future. Incoming data on economic developments in Poland indicate an improvement in economic situation, which however remains strongly diversified across sectors. In March, annual growth in industrial production and retail sales significantly increased, partly as a consequence of base effects related to the drop in these categories after the outbreak of pandemic in March 2020. At the same time, annual change in construction and assembly output remained strongly negative. This was accompanied by falling average employment in the enterprise sector and increasing average annual wage growth in this sector. According to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, inflation in April 2021 stood at 4.3% y/y. Increase in inflation was driven primarily by a further rise in fuel prices stemming from significantly higher than a year ago oil prices in the international markets as well as growing food prices. At the same time, the annual CPI has been pushed up by electricity prices that rose at the beginning of 2021 and by the increases of waste disposal charges, i.e. by factors that  similarly to growing commodity prices  were independent from the domestic monetary policy. The growing costs of running business amidst the pandemic, including higher transport charges and temporary disruptions in supply chains, also continue to add to inflation. The abovementioned factors will probably translate into annual price growth staying above the upper band for deviations from the inflation target in the coming months. At the same time, next year  after the factors temporarily increasing price growth fade  inflation is expected to decrease. Price developments next year will depend on robustness of economic recovery, including situation in the labour market after phasing- out of anti-crisis measures. Available forecasts indicate that the coming quarters will see a recovery of economic activity, although the scale and pace of the recovery are uncertain. The further course of the pandemic and its impact on the economic situation in Poland and abroad continue to be the main source of uncertainty. The economic policy measures, including the easing of NBP's monetary policy introduced last year and the expected recovery in the global economy, will have a positive impact on the domestic economic situation. The pace of the economic recovery in Poland will also depend on further developments of the zloty exchange rate. These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in the secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In order to strengthen the impact of NBP's monetary policy easing on the economy. NBP may also intervene in the foreign exchange market. The timing and scale of the measures taken by NBP will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also continue to offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks."
Thailand,2021-05-05,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 3/2021 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 5 May 2021 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent. The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a much lower rate due to the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak which affected domestic spending and the recovery of foreign tourist figures. The Committee viewed that procurement and distribution of vaccines in an adequate and timely manner was the most important issue for the Thai economy at the present. Regarding financial measures, the most important one would be the distribution of liquidity to the businesses and households additionally affected by the new outbreak. In particularly, credit measures and expedited debt restructuring would reduce financial burden in a more targeted manner than cutting the policy rate, which was already at a low level and remained supportive of economic recovery. The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting to preserve the limited policy space to act at the appropriate and most effective timing. The Thai economy would expand at a much lower rate due to the third wave of the outbreak which affected domestic spending. In addition, the recovery of foreign tourist figures would be affected by the longer-than-expected delay in the re-opening of the country and the uncertain international travel restriction measures. The main driving force of the economy would be merchandise exports, which improved in line with the expansion of trading partner economies. However the impact on the overall labor market would be limited. Meanwhile the government's relief and financial measures additionally announced would partly support the economic recovery in the short term. Nevertheless fiscal stimulus for fiscal year 2022 would decrease somewhat owing to the expedition of budget disbursement under the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Loans to Solve Problems, to Remedy and Restore the Economy and Society as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic. BE. 2563 (2020) that was front-loaded to the current fiscal year. Significant risks to the Thai economy in the period ahead included the distribution and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination, uneven recovery across economic sectors resulting in a more vulnerable labor market which would affect household income and private consumption, and more fragile financial positions, particularly among SMEs and tourism businesses that had lower debt servicing capability in line with lower incomes; while household savings as a share of income declined and reduced capability to cushion expenses. Headline inflation would temporarily increase in the second quarter of 2021 due to the low level of crude oil prices in the same quarter of last year. Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target. Despite ample overall liquidity and low financing costs, the distribution of liquidity remained uneven due to increased credit risks. Credit expansion thus needed to be more broad- based after the commencement of the special loan facility for businesses. Long-term government bond yields gradually declined from the previous period. On exchange rates, the Thai baht depreciated against the US dollar relatively more than regional currencies. The Committee would closely monitor developments in both the global and domestic financial markets and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem. The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery impacted by the new outbreak. The measures to accelerate the procurement and distribution of vaccines would prevent the outbreak from being prolonged. Fiscal measures should ensure the continuity of fiscal impulses, mitigate the impacts of the outbreak, and support the economic restoration going forward. Monetary policy must remain accommodative. The new financial rehabilitation measures to support business recovery post- COVID- 19 should accelerate the distribution of liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner, reduce debt burden, and support the economic recovery. In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring. The Bank of Thailand would closely monitor the progress and assess the efficacy of financial and credit measures. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to emphasize supporting the economic recovery. In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors to the economic outlook, namely the new outbreak, the distribution and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, and the adequacy of government measures as well as financial and credit measures. The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary."
Czech Republic,2021-05-06,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank unanimously kept interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 0.25%, the discount rate at 0.05% and the Lombard rate at 1%.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates initially, followed by a rise in rates from roughly the middle of this year onwards. The current economic situation and the economic outlook are still being fundamentally affected by the course of the pandemic and the anti-pandemic measures in the Czech Republic and abroad. The economic performance of our trading partners in the first half of this year is being adversely affected by the extension of foreign government measures to combat the pandemic and an initially sluggish pace of vaccination. On the other hand, the decline in economic activity in the euro area is being offset by strong demand for industrial production. Together with a marked rise in commodity prices, this is being reflected in growth in foreign inflation pressures in both the producer and consumer areas. However, these pressures will lessen next year. The anti-pandemic measures abroad will be eased gradually as the pace of vaccination accelerates in the next few months. Buoyant economic growth will thus resume during the year. The monetary policy of the European Central Bank will nonetheless remain very accommodative. The outlook for euro interest rates therefore remains negative. The Brent crude oil price outlook has shifted considerably higher compared with the previous forecast as a result of reduced extraction. However, oil prices are not expected to rise further. The euro will appreciate slightly against the dollar, broadly in line with the assumptions of the previous forecast. The Czech economy continues to suffer from the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. Government shutdowns have been constraining much of wholesale, retail and services with short breaks for over a year now, and the same will apply even after a partial easing in May. Household consumption will thus be subdued in the first half of the year, despite continued government financial support. Besides the shutdowns, economic performance is being adversely affected by supply shortfalls in global production chains. This is having an adverse impact on some domestic industrial sectors. The reopening of the domestic economy in the next few months will be enabled by gradual immunisation of the population. Czech household and corporate sentiment will simultaneously improve. Household spending, deferred during the pandemic, will foster renewed growth in private consumption, which will become a driver of the economic recovery. Domestic industry will also start running smoothly again in the months ahead. Like last year, expansionary fiscal policy will dampen the negative impacts of the pandemic on economic activity this year. However, most government support measures will fade out next year. In 2021 as a whole, the economy will thus grow only slightly, with annual GDP growth being highly volatile over the course of the year. Economic growth will pick up appreciably next year. Following its recent drop close to the 2% target, inflation will rise back towards the upper boundary of the tolerance band in the quarters ahead. This will be due to a sharp year-on-year increase in fuel prices initially, to buoyant growth in food prices in the second half of the year, and also to renewed growth in administered prices at the end of the year. Core inflation will fall only gradually from its current elevated levels. Its decline will be slowed by significant domestic demand pressures and brisk growth in industrial prices abroad. The overall inflation pressures will start to ease in the autumn as the current elevated growth of import prices subsides. Conversely, domestic price pressures will rise slightly owing to a gradual reopening of the domestic economy and a gradual pick-up in wage growth. Inflation will return close to the target next year, aided by a gradual tightening of the monetary conditions from roughly the middle of this year onwards. Monetary policy-relevant inflation, which looks past the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, will be slightly lower than headline inflation. It will fall towards the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon. The koruna will appreciate gradually further according to the forecast. This will primarily reflect an improving domestic epidemic situation, which will enable the economy to be gradually reopened. A strengthening koruna will also be fostered by a widening interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area due to an expected rise in domestic market rates. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates initially, followed by a rise in rates from roughly the middle of this year onwards. The initial rate stability reflects a subsiding need for easy monetary conditions. Sizeable price pressures from the domestic and foreign economy, the resumption of economic life in the rest of this year and a further improvement in economic activity in 2022 will require an increase in market interest rates from roughly the middle of this year onwards. By comparison with the previous forecast, the inflation outlook is higher for this year and to a lesser extent for next year as well. Economic growth has been revised downwards for this year and upwards for next year. The outlooks for domestic interest rates and the koruna exchange rate are little changed. The Bank Board assessed the uncertainties and risks of the new forecast as being less substantial than in the previous forecasts and as broadly balanced overall. A more gradual fading of the pandemic, linked with lengthier lockdowns and a cyclical downturn at home and abroad, which could have anti-inflationary impacts, is a risk to the forecast. A risk in the opposite direction stems from the disruption to global production and supply chains and its pass-through to prices."
Malaysia,2021-05-06,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 1.75 percent. The global economic recovery continues to strengthen, particularly in the major economies, supported by improvements in manufacturing and trade activity, although the pace may vary across countries. The ongoing roll-out of vaccination programmes and sizeable fiscal stimulus measures in the US as well as policy support in other major economies will further facilitate an improvement in domestic demand. However, the recovery trajectory in some economies could be disrupted by a re-tightening of containment measures to curb COVID-19 resurgences. Recent financial market volatility has somewhat receded, and financial conditions remain supportive of growth. The balance of risks to the growth outlook remains tilted to the downside, due mainly to uncertainty over the path of the pandemic as well as potential risks of heightened financial market volatility. For Malaysia, latest indicators point to continued improvements in economic activity in the first quarter and into April. While the recent re-imposition of containment measures in select locations will affect economic activity in the short term, the impact will be less severe as almost all economic sectors are allowed to operate. The growth trajectory is projected to improve, driven by the stronger recovery in global demand and increased public and private sector expenditure amid continued support from policy measures. Growth will also be supported by higher production from existing and new manufacturing facilities, particularly in the E&E and primary-related sub-sectors, as well as oil and gas facilities. The progress of the domestic COVID-19 vaccine programme will also lift sentiments and contribute towards recovery in economic activity. The growth outlook, however, remains subject to downside risks, stemming mainly from ongoing uncertainties in developments related to the pandemic, and potential challenges that might affect the roll-out of vaccines both globally and domestically. Headline inflation in 2021 is projected to average higher between 2.5% and 4.0%, primarily due to the cost-push factor of higher global oil prices. In terms of trajectory, headline inflation is anticipated to temporarily spike in the second quarter of 2021, due particularly to the lower base from the low domestic retail fuel prices in the corresponding quarter of 2020. However, this will be transitory as headline inflation is projected to moderate thereafter as this base effect dissipates. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to remain subdued, averaging between 0.5% and 1.5% for the year, amid continued spare capacity in the economy. The outlook, however, is subject to global oil and commodity price developments. The MPC considers the stance of monetary policy to be appropriate and accommodative. Given the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the stance of monetary policy going forward will continue to be determined by new data and information, and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth. The Bank remains committed to utilise its policy levers as appropriate to foster enabling conditions for a sustainable economic recovery. Bank Negara Malaysia 06 May 2021."
Turkiye,2021-05-06,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 19 percent. The global economy, having contracted sharply in 2020 due to the pandemic, continues to recover on the back of accommodative policies and positive developments in the vaccination process. This improvement process is determined especially by the acceleration in manufacturing industry activity and global trade. While commodity prices have increased again in the recent period, the effects of the rising global inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant. Despite the constraining effect of the pandemic, domestic economic activity is strong. While domestic demand has slightly decelerated due to pandemic restrictions, external demand remains strong. Manufacturing industry activity exhibits a strong momentum, whereas the weak course continues in the services sector, which has been adversely affected by the pandemic restrictions. Nevertheless, risks for economic activity exist in either direction depending on the progress of the pandemic and the vaccination process. Consumer loans, along with commercial loans, exhibit a milder course, and the durability of this development is monitored for macroeconomic stability. Despite the rise in commodity prices, the strong upward trend in exports, the significant fall in gold imports and the slowdown in credit amid the tightening of financial conditions support the expected improvement in the current account balance. Demand and cost factors, supply constraints in some sectors, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook. The decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand has begun to be observed. Taking into account the high levels of inflation and inflation expectations, the current monetary policy stance will be maintained until the significant fall in the April Inflation Report's forecast path is achieved. Accordingly, the MPC has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The policy rate will continue to be determined at a level above inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is reached. The stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and perpetual decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Philippines,2021-05-11,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility at 2.0 percent. The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were likewise kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. Latest inflation forecasts indicate that inflation is likely to settle within the target range in 2021 and 2022. Inflation is now projected to track a slightly lower path in 2021 to average near the upper end of the target band, as price pressures on food commodities are abating with improved weather conditions, the impact of Executive Orders No. 128 and 133, s. 2021, and the implementation of direct non-monetary interventions to alleviate supply constraints. Meanwhile, the inflation forecast for 2022 is seen to remain near the mid-point of the target but has increased slightly owing in part to rising international crude oil prices. The risks to the inflation outlook are also broadly balanced. The Monetary Board emphasizes that the timely implementation of approved non-monetary measures will be crucial in mitigating further supply-side pressures on meat prices and inflation. At the same time, the Monetary Board expects the domestic economy to continue to recover in the coming months, aided by the Government's targeted fiscal interventions and the sustained rollout of its vaccination program. Improved prospects overseas should also support the outlook for domestic economic activity. However, the recent surge in COVID-19 infections and the resulting measures to contain it continue to temper market confidence and pose substantial downside risks to domestic demand. On balance, the expected path of inflation and downside risks to domestic economic growth warrant keeping monetary policy settings steady. The Monetary Board believes that sustained support for domestic demand remains a priority for monetary policy, especially as risk aversion continues to hamper credit activity despite ample liquidity in the financial system. Looking ahead, the BSP affirms that maintaining an accommodative stance should quicken the economy's transition toward a sustainable recovery. The BSP remains committed to deploying its full range of instruments as appropriate in support of its price and financial stability mandates."
Romania,2021-05-12,"In its meeting of 12 May 2021, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The annual inflation rate dropped in March 2021 somewhat less than expected (to 3.05 percent from 3.16 percent in February), given that the decelerations reported by VFE and tobacco product components and the slowdown in core inflation were largely offset, in terms of impact, by the higher-than-expected change in fuel prices. However, compared to December 2020, when it had declined to 2.06 percent, the annual inflation rate rose notably at the end of 2021 Q1. Behind this stood the transitory impact of the liberalisation of the electricity market for household consumers and the rise in fuel prices driven by higher oil prices, only partly counterbalanced by the disinflationary influences from the VFE and tobacco product segments, as well as from core inflation deceleration. In line with expectations, the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate continued to decrease in 2021 Q1, falling to 2.8 percent in March 2021 from 3.3 percent in December 2020. This was mainly the result of the disinflationary base effects associated with developments in the prices of some processed food items, to which added the modest influences of the aggregate demand deficit and of a slower depreciation in annual terms of the leu against the euro. Nevertheless, the dynamics of this component are still marked by the pre-pandemic underlying inflationary pressures, reflecting, inter alia, the upside trend of short-term inflation expectations, along with influences from a rebound in consumption on certain segments, as well as from supply-side disruptions and costs linked with the pandemic and with the measures to prevent the coronavirus spread. In March 2021, the average annual CPI inflation rate remained flat at the 2.6 percent level reported in December 2020; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual rate declined to 2.1 percent from 2.3 percent in December 2020. The new statistical data reconfirmed the economic growth by 4.8 percent in 2020 Q4 and the slower GDP decline in annual terms to -1.4 percent from -5.6 percent in Q3, implying the considerable absorption of the aggregate demand deficit at the end of the previous year. The economic activity upturn owed entirely to domestic demand. Apart from the major contribution of the change in inventories, behind the revival in domestic absorption stood also, to a small extent, general government consumption. The positive impact of gross fixed capital formation declined, however, versus Q3, although its annual change posted a mild increase amid the markedly faster growth in new construction works, with the contribution, inter alia, from public investment and government programmes. At the same time, the negative annual dynamics of private consumption deepened marginally, as the impact of the renewed stronger contraction in households' purchases  attributable mainly to the drop in services, in the context of the resurgence of the pandemic  was largely offset by that of the rise in other sub-components, after their considerable decline in Q3. On the other hand, the negative contribution of net exports to annual GDP dynamics increased against the backdrop of a relatively swifter pick-up in imports of goods and services, entailing also a new widening of the trade deficit compared to the same period of the previous year. Under the circumstances, as well as following a more pronounced worsening of the primary income balance owing to dividend distribution flows, the current account deficit widened significantly faster in annual terms, in spite of rising inflows of EU funds to the current account. According to the latest high-frequency indicators, economic recovery carried on in 2021 Q1, but at a much slower pace, amid mixed developments in the structure of aggregate demand and at sectoral level. Thus, retail trade posted a mildly faster increase in annual terms in Q1 and the annual dynamics of motor vehicles and motorcycles sales witnessed a strong return to positive territory January through February; at the same time, market services to households recorded a lower contraction (by almost a half), in annual terms, amid the easing (at least for a while) of some restrictions on the hospitality industry. During the same period, however, the annual dynamics of the construction activity and industrial output re-entered/moved again slightly deeper into negative territory, alongside a lower positive change in new manufacturing orders, as well as a further contraction, in annual terms, in net direct investment, albeit entirely on the back of intercompany lending. At the same time, the trade deficit saw a faster widening in annual terms amid a more visible re-acceleration of the negative annual dynamics of exports. In turn, the current account deficit widened at a much stronger pace than in the same year-ago period, inter alia, following the marked worsening of the primary and especially the secondary income balance. Looking at the financial market, relevant interbank money market rates largely corrected in April their increase recorded halfway through the previous quarter. Government security yields also posted significant downward adjustments in April, remaining however visibly above the historically very low readings reached prior to the heightening of international financial market volatility. Lending rates on the main types of new business to non-bank clients also went further down February through March 2021 or consolidated at their previous low values. At the same time, after the upward adjustment in March, the EUR/RON exchange rate continued to rise slowly in the first part of April, before tending to stabilise at the new readings (inter alia amid the interest rate differential). The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector re-embarked on an upward path in February 2021 and then stepped up to 6.6 percent in March  as the flow of domestic currency loans increased to a historical high , its quarterly average thus advancing to 5.7 percent from 4.7 percent in 2020 Q4. The leu-denominated component saw its dynamics pick up further, climbing to two-digit readings in March, i.e. 11.3 percent, versus 8.8 percent in January 2021, amid the recovery of economic activity and the downtrend in interest rates, as well as a result of government programmes, whose contribution to the hefty flow of credit in the past two months was, however, marginal. Thus, the share of leu-denominated credit in total widened to 70.1 percent in March, a record high for the post-January 1996 period. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the May 2021 Inflation Report, which incorporates the latest available data and information. The current scenario shows the forecasted annual inflation rate following a relatively higher path over the next two years, as it is again revised significantly upwards in the short term and to a smaller extent over the latter part of the projection horizon. Specifically, the annual inflation rate is expected to climb visibly above the upper bound of the variation band of the target in 2021 H2, under the stronger transitory impact of supply-side factors, including the steep rise in some commodity prices likely to accelerate inflation globally. At the onset of 2022, the annual inflation rate is, however, seen returning and remaining afterwards in the upper half of the band, above the values anticipated in March 2021, amid the probably faster widening of the positive output gap after its reopening in 2021 Q3, in the context of relatively swifter economic growth, spurred inter alia by committing EU funds under the Next Generation EU programme. Considerable uncertainties and risks to the new outlook further stem, however, from the evolution of the pandemic and of the associated restrictive measures, largely dependent on the extent and effectiveness of the vaccination process. Major sources of uncertainties and two-way risks also continue to be the fiscal policy stance, in the context of the budget consolidation presumed to be carried out gradually over the medium term, as well as the absorption of European funds, especially those under the Next Generation EU programme, considering inter alia the still ongoing procedures related to the 2021-2024 Convergence Programme and the National Recovery and Resilience Plan. Uncertainties are also associated with labour market conditions, given the recent positive developments in terms of new jobs and hiring intentions, but also the short-term outlook for government support measures. Also relevant continue to be the synchronised uptrends in many commodity prices. In the meeting held today, 12 May 2021, based on the currently available data and assessments, and in light of the elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 1.25 percent per annum; moreover, it decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 0.75 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 1.75 percent per annum. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to preserve price stability over the medium term in line with the 2.5 percent Â±1 percentage point flat inflation target, in a manner supportive of the recovery of economic activity in the context of fiscal consolidation, while safeguarding financial stability. The NBR is closely monitoring domestic and global developments and stands ready to use its available instruments in order to achieve the overriding objective regarding medium-term price stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be published on 14 May 2021 at 12:00 p.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 24 May 2021, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 7 July 2021."
Chile,2021-05-13,"NoPtrae sdse R eplereasnes*a Thursday 13 May, 2021 Monetary Policy Meeting  May 2021 At today's Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50%. Furthermore, no changes were made to the unconventional liquidity and credit support measures. The decisions were adopted by the unanimous vote of all the Board members. In the external scenario, the overall international outlook is evolving positively. Global growth projections continue to strengthen, in a context where the global evolution of the pandemic has improved, which has allowed for the easing of sanitary restrictions, especially in developed countries. Expectations and the mood in the financial markets remain favorable, with improvements in the stock markets of the main economies, increased capital inflows to emerging economies and higher commodity prices. Most noteworthy among the latter are the strong recovery of oil and the copper hikes. At the same time, however, inflationary concerns have increased amid higher headline inflation, stronger cost pressures and significant demand stimuli, especially in the United States, which has caused some volatility in the financial markets. In some Latin American economies, despite better economic figures in the first quarter, the prospects are looking less favorable as they face a more complex sanitary and political outlook. In the domestic financial market, the nominal 10-year sovereign rate has seen an increase of some 30 to 40 basis points higher than that observed in developed markets since early March, which may be associated with idiosyncratic factors. The Bank once again took extraordinary measures to contain the financial volatility that might be generated by pension fund portfolio adjustments. The exchange rate appreciated, amid the sustained rise in the copper price. About bank credit, the activity of the Fogape-Reactiva program has continued to increase, while the first-quarter Bank Lending Survey reported improved demand and supply conditions in several segments, some of which were favored by a lower perception of risk. Nonetheless, and largely due to the high comparison base, the real annual variation rate of commercial loans turned negative. In turn, consumer loans moderated their annual contraction, and housing loans' performance remained relatively stable. Interest rates have remained low for all credit segments. Regarding activity, the March Imacec posted an annual growth rate of 6.4% (-1.6% month-on- month seasonally adjusted), well above expectations. This suggests, in part, a better adaptation of agents to the sanitary context, which during April and May should be reflected in a milder- than-expected impact of quarantines. By sectors, retail continued to perform well, while services and construction activity continued to perform below pre-pandemic levels. In the labor market, the various sources of information point to a significant increase with respect to the lowest levels of mid-2020, although with differences as to how much of the loss of formal salaried jobs has been recovered. In any case, differences by sector and type of occupation are also observed. In this context, private expectations for this year's growth are on the rise, pointing mostly to figures above 6% (6.2% being the median of May's Economic Expectations Survey). Both headline and core CPI âi.e., without volatilesâ have continued to fluctuate around 3% annually. Again, incoming figures show increases in the prices of gasoline and some foodstuffs. In addition to this, there has been continued high demand together with production and supply difficulties in several goods. One- and two-year-ahead expectations continue to stand around 3% annually. The Board considers that the outlook for economic recovery has improved, bearing in mind the data known since the publication of the last Monetary Policy Report and the new demand Nota de prensa boosting measures that have been implemented. This, together with an improved global scenario, reduces downside risks and positions the performance of the economy around the positive sensitivity analyzed in the March Report. Even so, the convergence of inflation to the target over the policy horizon still requires the monetary stimulus to be highly expansionary. Thus, the MPR will be kept at its minimum of 0.5% for as long as it is deemed necessary for the recovery of the economy to take hold. As for the unconventional measures, so far close to 75% of the FCIC3 available funds have been used. Since January the asset purchase program has reinvested coupons as they mature, a policy that will remain in place until June. From then onwards, the stock will be gradually reduced based on the maturities of the assets in the portfolio. The minutes corresponding to this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours Monday 31 May 2021. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will take place on Tuesday 8 June, will be released at 18:00 hours the same day. ____The Spanish original prevails.

Mexico,2021-05-13,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 4.00%. Global economic activity continues to recover heterogeneously across countries associated with vaccine availability and the amount of stimulus spending. Financial markets exhibited a more stable behavior. Global inflation increased, reflecting recent pressures from commodity prices, especially energy-related, as well as from comparison-base effects and some cost-related pressures. In most advanced economies, headline and core inflation remain at low levels and their central banks reiterated that they will maintain accommodative monetary policy stances. Among the most relevant global risks are those associated with the pandemic and a greater-than-expected increase in inflation. Since the last monetary policy decision, the Mexican peso appreciated slightly, shorter-term interest rates increased and longer-term ones fluctuated in a narrow range. Although the economic recovery slowed during the first quarter, higher growth is expected for the rest of the year, with a more equilibrated balance of risks. Nevertheless, ample slack conditions are foreseen for the economy as a whole, with significant differences across sectors. Annual headline inflation was affected by the abovementioned factors and increased more than anticipated, reaching 6.08% in April, while core inflation and non-core inflation registered 4.13% and 12.34%, respectively. Inflation expectations for 2021 rose and those for the medium and long terms remained stable at levels above the 3% target. The revised forecasts for headline and core inflation display short-term levels above those published in the last Quarterly Report. Nevertheless, both are still expected to converge to the 3% target starting in the second quarter of 2022. These forecasts are subject to risks. On the upside: external inflationary pressures; cost-related pressures or a reallocation of spending; persistence of core inflation; and exchange rate depreciation. On the downside: effects stemming from the negative output gap; greater social distancing measures; and foreign exchange appreciation. The balance of risks that might affect the anticipated path for inflation within the forecast horizon is biased to the upside. In a highly uncertain environment, the risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets pose major challenges for monetary policy. Given the recent shocks that have affected inflation, it is necessary for the adjustment in relative prices to take place in an orderly manner so that an impact on price formation and inflation expectations is avoided. With the presence of all its members, the Governing Board decided unanimously to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 4.00%. This, considering the abovementioned inflation forecasts, the risks they are subject to, as well as the need to consolidate a downward trajectory for headline and core inflation to the 3% target. Looking ahead, 1 monetary policy implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on inflation, on its foreseen trajectories within the forecast horizon, and on its expectations. The Governing Board will take the necessary actions based on incoming information in order for the policy rate to be consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. It is necessary to safeguard the institutional framework, strengthen the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopt the necessary actions on both monetary and fiscal policy fronts, to enable a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole."
Peru,2021-05-13,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT MAY 2021 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation decreased from 2.6 percent in March to 2.4 percent in April due to lower supply-side pressures. Trend inflation remains at the lower part of the target range. Year-on- year core inflation was 1.7 percent in April. Inflation is expected to remain within the target range throughout 2021 and 2022; and to lie at the lower part of the range during 2022, as economic activity will remain below its potential level. One-year-ahead expected inflation was 2.3 percent in April. Leading indicators moderated in April, and most indicators of firms' growth expectations deteriorated relative to the previous month. Global economic recovery is expected to be more pronounced in the next quarters, as the vaccination process continues around the world, and significant stimulus packages are implemented in developed countries. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows, and stands ready to expand monetary stimulus using a range of instruments. As of May 12. BCRP injection operations totaled S/ 56,005 million, of which S/ 49,409 million were associated with government- backed repos. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on June 10, 2021."
South Africa,2021-05-20,"PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 20 May 2021 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank The steady rate of vaccination in many countries has lifted projections for global economic growth and boosted confidence, significantly. Vaccination rates have not been uniform, however, with many emerging and developing countries lagging behind. This uneven vaccination rollout will weigh heavily on some countries more than others and on economic activity in sectors that are more dependent on close contact, such as travel, tourism, hospitality and leisure. Until vaccination is widespread and populations develop sufficient immunity to curb virus transmission, it is expected that waves of infection will continue. As indicated by South Africa's public health authorities, a third wave of virus infection is probable in the near future. The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) April forecast for global gross domestic product (GDP) for 2021 was revised up to 6.0%. The SARB's forecast for global MPC Statement 20 May 2021 Page 1. The SARB's forecast for global MPC Statement 20 May 2021 Page 1 growth in 2021 now also sits at 6.0%.1 For 2022, we expect global growth of about 3.8%. Although policy settings in advanced economies remain accommodative, higher global inflation and greater uncertainty about world interest rates has contributed to more recent financial market and capital flow volatility. This reflects persistent risk aversion, especially for emerging market economies that fail to take advantage of improved global prospects or run large macroeconomic imbalances. Following an expansion of 6.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Bank's forecast for South Africa's first quarter growth stands at 2.7%, much stronger than the 0.2% contraction expected at the time of the March meeting. The economy is expected to grow by 4.2% in 2021 (up from 3.8%). The stronger growth forecast for 2021 reflects better sectoral growth performances and a more robust terms of trade in the first quarter of this year. Despite rising oil prices and a higher total import bill, commodity prices have risen to new highs, strengthening income gains to the economy. Household spending is expected to be healthy this year, in line with the easing of lockdown restrictions and low interest rates. Getting back to pre-pandemic output levels, however, will take time. Supply responses remain muted in some sectors harder hit by the pandemic. GDP is expected to grow by 2.3% in 2022 and by 2.4% in 2023, little changed since the March meeting. 1 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. The IMF's global forecast for 2022 sits at 4.4%. MPC Statement 20 May 2021 Page 2 Overall, and after upward revisions, the risks to the domestic growth outlook are assessed to be balanced. Moderate growth in household spending is expected over the forecast horizon and global conditions are generally supportive of growth. Slow progress on vaccinations, limited energy supply and policy uncertainty continue to pose downside risks to growth. The large current account surplus at present reflects good growth and higher prices for exports, still moderate prices for imported oil, and slowly reviving demand for imported consumer and investment goods. This surplus is expected to give way to a modest current account deficit by next year (2022), as exports slow and imports accelerate.2 Although financing conditions have modestly improved and fiscal risk has eased, the yield curve for rand-denominated bonds remains steep. The generally favourable global conditions and strong commodity export prices have led to the appreciation of the rand through the latter half of 2020 and into this year, moving the currency close to its long-run equilibrium level. Since the March meeting, the rand has appreciated by 4% on a trade-weighted basis. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R14.46 to the US dollar, compared with R14.96 at the time of the previous meeting. Headline consumer price inflation averaged 3.3% in 2020. The forecast for 2021 is slightly lower at 4.2% (down from 4.3%) and for 2022 and 2023 unchanged at 4.4% and 4.5%, respectively. In 2020, core inflation also averaged 3.3%. The forecast for 2021 is lower at 3.0% (down from 3.3%) and unchanged for 2022 and 2023 at 4.0% and 4.3%, respectively. 2 The current account is expected to be in surplus of 2.0% of GDP in 2021, shifting to a deficit of -0.6% in 2022. MPC Statement 20 May 2021 Page 3 At a global level, a wide range of prices is accelerating, from raw materials to intermediate inputs to food, reflecting both global supply shortages and rising demand. Oil prices were revised up sharply in the previous forecast, and remain unchanged, resulting in petrol price inflation of 12.5% for 2021 (down slightly from 12.7%).3 Electricity prices are significantly higher at 10.6% for 2021 (up from 9.7%). Going forward, a stronger exchange rate, ongoing moderation in unit labour costs, and sustained economic slack are expected to offset higher electricity and food price inflation, keeping the headline inflation forecast relatively stable. Expectations of future inflation have broadly stabilised at around 4.0% for 2021 and 4.2% for 2022. Market-based expectations for inflation are slightly lower for 2021 and over longer horizons.4 The overall risks to the inflation outlook appear to be to the upside. Housing-led services price inflation may continue to surprise to the downside. Food price inflation, already very high globally, has also been more moderate than expected in the South African market, due to a stronger exchange rate and robust crop production. Domestic and global producer price inflation have been rising. Further risks could arise from higher domestic import tariffs and escalating wage demands. Despite generally low pass-through, a weaker rand would create additional upside risk to inflation, alongside the ongoing risk from electricity and other administered prices. Oil prices have 3 Our assumptions are now for oil prices to average about $62 per barrel in 2021 and $60 per barrel in 2022 and in 2023. 4 The (Q1) Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey expectations for 2021 remain at 3.9%, 4.2% for 2022, and 4.4% for 2023. Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) expect inflation to be higher at 4.2% (from 4.1%) in 2021, unchanged at 4.3 in 2022 and slightly lower at 4.4% in 2023 (down from 4.5%). Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These now sit at 4.5% for the 5-year and 5.98% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year breakeven inflation sits at 6.43%. MPC Statement 20 May 2021 Page 4 increased sharply this year and, while forecast to remain at current levels, are subject to increasing upside risk as recent data has shown. Compared to the March meeting, a higher growth forecast implies a small further narrowing of the output gap over the forecast period. The policy stance and repurchase rate level remains highly accommodative, and will remain so even with steps taken to normalise interest rate levels in response to rising inflation. With inflation expectations remaining stable, and despite inflation risk increasing, the Committee still expects inflation to be contained in 2021, before rising to around the midpoint of the inflation target range in 2022 and 2023. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep rates unchanged at 3.5% per annum. The implied policy rate path of the Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) indicates an increase of 25 basis points in each of the second and fourth quarters of 2021. Monetary policy continues to be accommodative, keeping financial conditions supportive of credit demand as the economy recovers from the pandemic and associated lockdowns. The Bank has ensured adequate liquidity in domestic markets and will continue to closely monitor funding markets for stress. In addition, regulatory relief provided to banks continues to support lending to households and firms. Important macroeconomic gains would be realised by achieving a stable public debt level, increasing the supply of energy, moderating administered price inflation and keeping wage inflation low into the recovery. Such steps will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy. MPC Statement 20 May 2021 Page 5 Economic and financial conditions are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. In this uncertain environment, policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. The MPC will seek to look through temporary price shocks and focus on second round effects. As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting in response to new data and risks.

Hungary,2021-05-25,"At its meeting on 25 May 2021, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 26 May 2021:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy. Global macroeconomic and financial market developments continue to be driven primarily by the events related to the coronavirus pandemic; however, risks associated with global reflation have been increasing recently as well. A growing number of economies have been started to reopen. The pace of the reopening has been significantly influenced by developments in the pandemic and the population's vaccination coverage. World trade and global industrial production are already above the levels seen before the pandemic. In the first quarter of 2021, the US economy grew compared to the previous quarter, while the Chinese economy continued to expand. The euro area's economic performance declined in the first quarter. Nevertheless, incoming data exceeded earlier expectations for several Member States. In the past month, risk appetite was primarily driven by developments related to the coronavirus pandemic, price increases in commodity markets and global reflation concerns. After a significant increase at the beginning of the year, there was a slight reversal in developed market yields. However, a bigger-than-expected spike in US inflation in April led to a rise in global long-term yields again. Since the beginning of 2021, commodity prices have risen significantly, and global oil prices have remained above USD 65. The Federal Reserve's decision-makers left loose monetary conditions unchanged at their policy meeting in April and reiterated that the asset purchase programmes would be continued. The European Central Bank increased the amount of purchases made under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) in the second quarter. In the CEE region, the Czech. Polish and Romanian central banks have also left policy rates unchanged since the Council's previous interest rate decision. However, due to the rise in the outlook for inflation, an increasing number of central banks have indicated that they would stand ready to tighten monetary conditions when necessary. Hungarian economic growth continued in the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. According to the HCSO's preliminary release of adjusted data. Hungary's GDP grew by 1.9 percent in the first quarter of 2021 relative to the previous quarter, but it was 1.8 per cent below the level of a year earlier. Incoming data substantially exceeded market expectations and the projection in the MNB's March Inflation Report. Economic growth during the quarter was driven mainly by industry, financial and insurance activities as well as the information and communication sectors. The vaccination coverage rate of Hungary's population is at the top in the European Union; therefore, restrictive measures have started to be lifted gradually. As a result of the earlier opening than the European average, the restart of the economy is expected to pick up significantly in the second quarter, which will support a rapid recovery of Hungarian GDP. Real-time data point to double-digit economic growth in the second quarter. The Hungarian economy exhibits the potential for a strong recovery. In 2020, the business investment rate stood at a high level of 27.3 percent. In March 2021, the unemployment rate continued to decline relative to the previous month and it remained low by international standards. Wage growth remained dynamic despite the pandemic. Credit markets continued to expand strongly even in international comparison. In terms of demand, the recovery has been driven by an increase in household income, a pick-up in government and private investment and the accelerating withdrawal of EU funds. According to the MNB's projection in the March Inflation Report. GDP is expected to rise by between 4 and 6 percent in 2021. Based on incoming data, in the Bank' assessment. GDP growth in 2021 is expected to be in the upper range of the March projection band, close to 6 percent. Following the reopening. Hungary's economic performance is expected to reach pre-pandemic levels no later than in the fourth quarter of 2021. In April 2021, annual inflation was 5.1 percent, and both core inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects stood at 3.1 percent. Inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects rose by 1.4 percentage points and 0.3 percentage points, respectively, relative to the previous month. The rise in inflation primarily reflected an increase in excise taxes on tobacco and rises in fuel prices. The increase in fuel prices and excise duty effects accounted for a total of 3.0 percentage points of inflation in April. Inflation is likely to be volatile in the coming months. Spikes in inflation occur due rising fuel prices, effects arising from increase in excise duties in April and demand-supply frictions as the economy restarts. According to the April EDP notification, the accrual-based government deficit was 8.1 percent of GDP in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, gross government debt increased temporarily to over 80 percent of GDP in 2020 after falling steadily since 2011; however, it is likely to shift to a downward path from this year as economic growth is restored and the deficit declines. Debt financing has been stable, strongly supported by domestic savings which have continued to rise recently. Outstripping expectations, the current account was in surplus in 2020. In the coming years, the country's current account balance is expected to improve further, driven by the recovery in external demand and the gradual increase in the output of new capacities. With the capital account strongly in surplus. Hungary's net lending is expected to improve significantly and net external debt to continue to fall further. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the MNB's government securities purchase programme has been successful even during the third wave of the pandemic and in a volatile international financial market environment. Purchases by the Bank have contributed to maintaining a stable liquidity position in the government securities market and improved the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the government securities purchase programme remains crucial. An increase in global reflation concerns could lead to heightened uncertainty in the government securities market again; therefore, the MNB will continue to use the programme by maintaining a lasting presence in the market, taking a flexible approach to changing the quantity and structure of weekly securities purchases, to the extent and for the time necessary. In the process of economic recovery the FGS Go! and the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme have been of key importance. The optimal size and structure of the programmes are continuously assessed by the Monetary Council. The MNB will continue to sterilise the resulting surplus liquidity issued under the programmes in full, using the preferential deposit instrument. At its meeting today, the Monetary Council left the base rate and the overnight deposit rate unchanged at 0.60 percent and -0.05 percent, respectively, and the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates at 1.85 percent. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at weekly tenders, in response to the increase in risk aversion vis-a-vis emerging markets. The Bank will maintain the difference between the base rate and the one-week deposit rate as long as warranted by inflationary risks. It is a priority for the MNB that short-term rates in every sub-market and at all times should develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. Therefore, similarly to previous quarters, the MNB will hold foreign exchange swap tenders providing euro liquidity at the end of June. Through an active market presence, the MNB cushions the spillover of tensions in international swap markets to the domestic market, thereby contributing to preserving the stability of monetary conditions and through this to maintaining price stability. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the upside risks related to the outlook for inflation have generally increased. A sustained rise in commodity prices and international freight costs result in a higher external inflation environment. Temporary demand-supply frictions due to the rapid restart of the domestic economy, renewed tightening of labour market capacities expected in certain sectors combined with dynamic wage growth have increased inflation risks. The Monetary Council continues to be committed to maintaining price stability. It is the Bank's clear intention to prevent the current uncertain environment from causing a sustained rise in inflation. In the Monetary Council's assessment, risks to the outlook for inflation have recently continued to strengthen even further. The projection in the June Inflation Report will be key in assessing the outlook for inflation and developments related to the economic recovery. The Monetary Council reiterates that they are ready to tighten monetary conditions in a proactive manner to the extent necessary in order to ensure price stability and to mitigate inflation risks."
Nigeria,2021-05-25,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 136 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON MONDAY 24th AND TUESDAY 25th MAY 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 24th and 25th of May 2021 as the global economy gradually emerges from the six-quarter long COVID-19 pandemic with lingering uncertainties. The recovery is on account of widespread vaccinations, easing of restrictions, reopening of economies and gradual return to international travels. India and Brazil however continue to battle high levels of infections and fatalities resulting from mutating strains of the virus. In the domestic environment, the economy is expected to remain on the current trajectory of recovery in 2021, mirroring the cautious optimistic trend in global output recovery. The Committee reviewed the developments in the global and domestic economic and financial environments in the second quarter of 2021 and the outlook for the rest of the year. Ten (10) members of the Committee were present at this meeting. Global Economic Developments The Committee noted that while the vaccination against COVID-19 is drastically reducing fatalities across several economies, the recovery remains uneven and is tilted against developing economies compared with the developed economies with better access to vaccines. Other emerging markets economies with strong manufacturing capabilities like China are also on the verge of full recovery. Accordingly the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised global output growth for 2021 to 60 per cent. This represents an upward revision of 05 percentage point, compared with the earlier projection of 55 per cent. The projection is, however, dependent on the efficient deployment of COVID-19 vaccines and sustained policy support across economies to strengthen the recovery of global output growth. Prices however, are expected to rise globally due to the massive monetary and fiscal injections in several countries 2 to mitigate the impact of the Pandemic. The MPC noted the gradual recovery of prices, especially amongst some developed economies as inflation continued a steady movement towards the long-term objective of their central banks. It is expected that inflation may breach the long- term objective of several central banks in the medium- term, as economic activities continue to recover with more people being vaccinated. In several Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs), inflation has remained relatively high, with some economies confronted with significantly higher inflationary pressures than others, because of legacy structural issues, capital flow reversals and unabating exchange rate pressures. The prevailing conditions in the global financial markets remained relatively stable, as central banks sustain monetary accommodation. There are, however, growing indications that monetary policy normalization may commence amongst some key central banks by the fourth quarter of 2021. The timing and pace of this normalization must, however, be carefully managed to mitigate the risk of a financial crisis post-Pandemic. Domestic Economic Developments Available output data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 051 per cent in the first quarter of 2021, compared with 011 and -362 per cent in Q4 2020 and Q3 2020, respectively. Real GDP was driven largely by the non-oil sector, which grew by 079 per cent in Q1 2021 compared with 169 and -251 per cent in Q4 2020 and Q3 2020, respectively. The major drivers of the non-oil GDP were Agriculture and Industry with sectoral growth rates of 228 and 305 per cent, respectively in Q1 2021. Whereas Agriculture declined by 114 percentage points from 342 per cent in Q4 2020. Industry, supported by growth in Manufacturing and Construction, grew by 330 percentage points from -025 per cent in Q4 2020. The sectoral contribution of Services to GDP, however, contracted from 131 per cent in Q4 2020 to -039 per cent in Q1 2021. The weak performance in the oil sector is largely attributable to the decline in production, in compliance with the OPEC+ production cut agreement. The Committee noted the marginal growth in the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) to 490 index points in April 2021 from 488 index points in March 2021. This increase is a lead indicator of recovery of output growth following the easing of restrictions to curtail the spread of the Pandemic. The Non-manufacturing PMI, however, declined marginally to 473 index points in April 2021, compared with 479 index points in March 2021. The employment level component of the manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs rose moderately in April 2021 to 465 and 482 index points from 459 and 477 index points in March 2021, respectively. The Committee noted the moderate decline in headline inflation (year-on-year) to 1812 per cent in April 2021 from 1817 per cent in March 2021, following nineteen consecutive months of continuous rise. The decrease was driven by a marginal slowdown in food inflation to 2272 per cent in April 2021 from 2295 per cent in the previous month. This was partly attributed to the Bank's massive interventions in various sectors of the economy to stimulate 5 aggregate demand and boost production, particularly for Small and Medium Scale Enterprises. The MPC, however, noted that headline inflation remained well above the ceiling of the Bank's 6-9 per cent inflation corridor as a result of a combination of factors, including: the heightened security tensions in the country and deteriorating public infrastructure. As a result, the Bank expressed its support to the Federal Government's commitment to tackle insecurity as this will improve the business environment and encourage economic activities to reduce inflation. The MPC was also mindful of the impact of exchange rate pressures resulting from capital flow reversals associated with the COVID-19 shock, as investors sought for safe havens. It however, applauded extant measures by the Bank in ensuring both liquidity and stability in the Foreign Exchange market as well as moderating the exchange rate pass-through to inflation. On the performance of monetary aggregates, the Committee noted that broad money supply (M3) grew by 115 per cent in April 2021, compared with 004 per cent in 6 March 2021. This development was largely driven by growth in Net Domestic Assets (NDA), while Net Foreign Assets (NFA) contracted. The growth in Net Domestic Assets reflects the growth in aggregate credit supported by the ongoing broad based monetary and fiscal stimulus. Accordingly gross banking sector credit at end-March 2021 stood at N2353 trillion compared with N2268 trillion at end-December 2020. This represents an increase of N085 trillion (year-to-date), of which commercial & merchant banks disbursed (N066 trillion), microfinance banks (N013 trillion), development finance institutions (N005 trillion), and primary mortgage banks and finance companies (N001 trillion). The liquidity condition in the banking system in the review period was determined by several factors including; fiscal disbursements and withdrawals by states and local governments, periodic CRR debits, foreign exchange interventions. Open Market Operations, and maturing CBN bills, the net effect of which imposed liquidity constraints on the banking system. The Committee noted the moderate decline in the equities market (year to date) as the All-Share Index (ASI) decreased by 197 per cent to 38,,28758 on May 24, 2021 from 39,,04513 on March 30, 2021. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) decreased by 430 per cent to N1996 trillion on May 24, 2021 from N2082 trillion on February 26, 2021. The MPC noted that the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and the Liquidity Ratio (LR) both remained above their prudential limits at 158 and 389 per cent, respectively. The Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) at 589 per cent in April 2021, showed progressive improvement compared with 66 per cent in April 2020. The MPC, however, urged the Bank to sustain its tight prudential regime to further reduce the level of Non-Performing Loans in the industry. The Committee noted the external reserves declined marginally to US$3417 billion as at May 21, 2021, from US$3429 billion as at end-April 2021. This reflects sales to the foreign exchange market and third-party payments. Outlook 8 The optimism for medium-term macroeconomic recovery in both the global and domestic economies is slow, but steadily growing, even as some level of uncertainty are still present. This is due to the unabating COVID-19 pandemic in some countries such as India and Brazil caused by mutation of the virus into more fatal strains. In addition, the recovery is uneven and seem to be more tilted towards countries that have high vaccination rate than those less vaccinated or that are still suffering from the effects of more fatal strain of COVID-19 disease. As conditions improve however, central banks of Advanced Economies are beginning to signal the possible shift to monetary policy normalization by the fourth quarter of 2021. Available data and forecasts for key macroeconomic variables for the Nigerian economy, suggest that output growth will continue to recover for the rest of 2021. This is premised on the continued support for agriculture to improve food supply, reduce inflation and improve employment. Others include efforts of both the monetary and fiscal authorities to improve infrastructure challenges in the country. The forecast for the Nigerian economy for 9 2021 is, thus, strong domestic push to support recovery particularly to ensure an end to insecurity in the country. Consequently as the productive capacity of the economy improves and the supply chain fully restored, we expect inflationary pressure to ease further, as the supply of goods and services offset demand. The Committee's Considerations At this meeting, the MPC recognized that the twin problems confronting the Nigerian Economy that must be addressed relates to stagflation, reflected in rising inflation with simultaneous contraction in output. Committee further recognized that the strategies put in place to rein in inflation through the use of series of administrative measures by the Bank to control money supply through liquidity mop up in the banking industry had started to yield results. It also recognized that measures put in place to stimulate output growth through the use of its intervention facilities to inject liquidity into employment generating and output stimulating initiatives like the Anchor Borrower Program. Targeted Credit Facility and 10 Agri-Business Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS) had started to yield results. In the view of the MPC, although the economy had successfully exited the recession, the recovery was very fragile given that the GDP of 051 per cent was still far below population growth rate. Committee therefore was of the view that, there is a strong need for the Monetary Authorities to consolidate on all administrative measures taken not only to rein in inflation, but also on the actions so far taken to grow output. In the Committee's view, such measures should include boosting consumption and investments, as well as diversifying the base of the economy through FX restrictions for the importation of goods and food products that can be produced in Nigeria. It also urged the Bank to continue to put in place measures that will boost export earnings. On consumption and investment. MPC noted that the intervention facilities under the Anchor Borrowers was N6314 billion granted to 3,,107,,949 small holder farmers cultivating 38 million of land hectares; for the AGSMEIS. N1117 billion to 29,,026 beneficiaries; and for the Targeted 11 Credit Facility. N2534 billion to 548,,345 beneficiaries - comprising 470,,969 households and 77,,376 SMEs. Notwithstanding that all these have helped in boosting output, the Bank should continue to aggressively increase its interventions in these subsectors, including agricultural processing and manufacturing. Under the National Youth Investment Fund. N204 billion was disbursed to 7,,057 beneficiaries, of which 4,,411 were individuals and 2,,646 were SMEs. Under the Creative Industry Financing Initiative, the CBN has disbursed N319 billion to 341 beneficiaries across movie production, movie distribution, music and software development. Under the N1 trillion Real Sector Intervention. N8563 billion had been disbursed for 233 real sector projects, of which 77 are in light manufacturing, 36 in agro-based industry, 30 in services and 11 in mining. Under the N100 billion Healthcare Support Intervention fund. N974 billion has been disbursed for 91 health care projects, of which 26 are pharmaceutical and 65 hospital services. Also N2325 million has been disbursed to 5 beneficiaries under the CBN Health Care Grant for Research on Covid-19 and Lassa Fever. Under the National Mass Metering program. N359 12 billion has been disbursed to 9 DisCos for the acquisition of 656,,752 electricity meters. Under the Nigerian Electricity Stabilization Facility 2 (NEMSF-2). N938 billion has also been disbursed to 11 DisCos. The Committee members applauded Government's efforts in combating the headwinds imposed by the Pandemic and urged that going forward. Government should avoid an entire nationwide lockdown like was experienced in 2020, as this will reverse the wholesome gains jointly achieved between the Government and the Central Bank in response to the outbreak of the Pandemic. The MPC carefully assessed the options on direction of policy in the short to medium term. It re-appraised current measures by the Government to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and the general preparedness of relevant public health agencies to guard against the spread of the mutating strains of the virus. To this end, the Committee noted the appropriate steps taken by the Government to ensure that up to 70 per cent of the populace get vaccinated to drastically drive down the infection rate in the country and hence, sustain economic activities. 13 The Committee noted the persisting security crisis, especially in major food producing regions of the country and the severe toll on food supply and prices. It noted that inflation had moderated marginally due to the unrelenting effort of the Bank in supporting agriculture to boost food supply and prices. The Committee, thus, re-iterated its call to the Government to intensify effort towards addressing the security situation in the country to ease supply bottlenecks and bring down food prices. The MPC further noted Government's commitment towards investing in public infrastructure despite constrained fiscal position and urged a continued focus on this objective, while exploring the option of effective partnership with the private sector, as improved road networks, telecommunications and power supply will greatly and proactively impact the supply chain and moderate price increments. It further noted the need for collaboration with Nigeria's huge diaspora, through the issuance of diaspora bonds targeted at specific infrastructure projects. Even as the Committee noted that the public debt stock was currently high, it was of the view that project specific diaspora bond issues could conveniently pay itself back without imposing a burden on 14 Government finances. It noted the complementary role this would play in boosting foreign exchange supply, accretion to reserves and easing of the current exchange rate pressure. The Committee noted that the equities market remained stable, an indication of investor confidence in the Nigerian economy in the medium-term. The MPC thus urged the Bank to maintain its collaboration with the fiscal authority to improve the investment climate towards attracting sustainable Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). With the developments in the Banking system, the Committee applauded the efforts of the CBN in ensuring a reasonably low level and steady reduction in Non- Performing Loans (NPLs), even as aggregate credit continued to expand through the crisis period. While NPLs remained marginally above the Bank's regulatory threshold, members noted that it was in line with the current state of macroeconomic imbalances occasioned by the Pandemic. The Committee's Decision 15 The recent developments in the domestic economy presented two broad options to the MPC, which were to either aggressively address the high inflationary pressure or continue to pursue measures aimed at supporting the recovery. Whereas the Committee remained overwhelmingly committed to supporting the efforts of the Federal Government in ensuring full restoration of the productive capacity of the economy, members remained much more focused towards achieving price stability in the short to medium-term. The MPC noted that economic growth could be hampered in an environment of unstable prices. To this end, the choice therefore was between loosening the stance of policy to ease credit further or tighten to moderate price development or maintain a hold stance in order to allow previous policy measures continue to permeate the economy while observing global and domestic developments. The Committee noted that an expansionary stance of policy could transmit to reduced pricing of the loan portfolios of Deposit Money Banks and result, therefore, in 16 cheaper credit to the real sector of the economy. On the converse, this expected transmission may be constrained by persisting security challenges and infrastructural deficits. On the other hand, while a contractionary stance will only address the monetary component of price development, supply side constraints such as the security crisis and infrastructural deficits can only be addressed by policies outside the purview of the Central Bank. tight stance in the view of members, will also hamper the Bank's objectives of providing low cost credit to households. Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Agriculture, and other output growth and employment stimulating sectors of the economy. Based on the above considerations, the MPC made the decision to hold all policy parameters constant. The Committee thus decided by a unanimous vote to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR). In summary, the MPC voted to: I Retain the MPR at 115 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; 17 III. Retain the CRR at 275 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 25th May 2021 18."
South Korea,2021-05-27,"The bank of korea. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period. Currently available information suggests that the recovery of the global economy has strengthened, supported by the economic stimulus in major countries, accelerated vaccinations, and the relaxation of restrictions on economic activity. In global financial markets, the rise in stock prices in major countries has moderated as risk-taking tendencies were offset by factors such as inflation concerns. Government bond yields have fluctuated within a relatively narrow range. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by national policy responses and their effects. The recovery of the Korean economy has strengthened. Exports have sustained their buoyancy and facilities investment has continued to recover robustly, while private consumption has gradually emerged from its slump. Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed having risen. Going forward, the recovery of the Korean economy is likely to strengthen thanks to the buoyancy of exports and investment as well as the improvement in private consumption. GDP growth this year is projected to be around 4%, significantly above the February forecast of 3.0%. Consumer price inflation has risen markedly to the lower-2% level due to the rising prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products as well as the accelerating increase in service prices. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has moved up considerably to the lower-1% level. The inflation expectations of the general public have risen slightly within the lower-2% range. It is forecast that consumer price inflation will run at the upper-1% range this year, considerably exceeding the February forecast of 1.3%. Core inflation is forecast to run at the lower-1% range. In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates have risen, affected mainly by strengthened economic recoveries at home and abroad. Stock prices continued to increase before declining moderately due to global financial market movements. The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fluctuated slightly. Household loan growth has remained high, and housing prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. While the Korean economic recovery is expected to strengthen and inflation to remain at a high level for some time, there are underlying uncertainties surrounding the path of COVID-19 and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to be modest. Thus, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process the Board will assess developments related to COVID-19 and economic developments in major countries, while paying closer attention to the buildup of financial imbalances such as fund flows concentrated in asset markets and household debt growth."
Pakistan,2021-05-28,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement May 28, 2021. At its meeting on 28th May 2021, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the policy rate at percent. Since its last meeting in March, the MPC was encouraged by the further upward revision in the FY21 growth forecast to.94 percent. The MPC noted that this confirms the strength of the broad-based economic rebound underway since the start of the fiscal year, on the back of targeted fiscal measures and aggressive monetary stimulus. This positive momentum is expected to persist, translating into higher growth next year. Inflation rose to 1. percent (y/y) in April, propped up by the lingering impact of this February's electricity tariff increase as well as pick-up in month-on-month food prices, partly driven by the usual seasonality around Ramzan. The MPC noted that supply-shocks to food and energy still dominate, with small number of energy and food items in the CPI basket accounting for about three-fourths of the rise in inflation since January. The MPC also observed that although core inflation in urban areas has risen by around. percentage points during this period, available evidence suggests that demand-side pressures on inflation continue to be relatively contained. This reflects the fact that despite the economic recovery, there is still some spare capacity following last year's contraction. Second-round effects from the supply shocks are also not visibly apparent: price pressures are concentrated in few items, wage growth is subdued keeping cap on costs, and inflation expectations remain reasonably anchored. As previously forecast, the headline year-on-year inflation rate is likely to remain elevated in the coming months due to the recent electricity tariff hike, pushing the average for FY21 close to the upper end of the announced range of 7-9 percent. As supply shocks dissipate thereafter, inflation is expected to gradually fall toward the 5-7 percent target range over the medium-term. In light of the foregoing considerations, the MPC was of the view that the current significantly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate to ensure the recovery becomes firmly entrenched and self-sustaining. This is especially so given the renewed heightened uncertainty created by the on-going third wave of Covid in Pakistan and the fiscal consolidation expected this fiscal year. As result, the MPC noted that it was important for monetary policy to remain supportive. The MPC observed that given the Covid-related uncertainties, the cost of withdrawing monetary stimulus too soon exceeded that of withdrawing too late. Looking ahead, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the MPC expects monetary policy to remain accommodative in the near term, and any adjustments in the policy rate to be measured and gradual to achieve mildly positive real interest rates over time. If demand side pressures emerge as the recovery becomes more durable and the economy returns to full capacity, the MPC noted that it would be prudent for monetary policy to begin to normalize through gradual reduction in the degree of accommodation. This would help ensure that inflation does not become entrenched at high level and financial conditions remain orderly, thereby supporting sustainable growth. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Real sector. The latest National Income Accounts data confirm that the economy has rebounded strongly from last year's severe Covid-shock, led by services and industry. The industrial sector is estimated to have grown. percent during FY21, driven by construction and large-scale manufacturing, especially the food, cement, textile and automobile sectors. The strong rebound is also reflected in exceptionally strong growth recorded in multiple high-frequency indicators across all three quarters of the year, including sales of fast-moving consumer goods and POL products. The agriculture sector is estimated to have grown. percent, with the production of three important cropsâwheat, rice and maizeârising to record highs and that of sugar cane to its second-highest ever level. Buoyed by the strong performance in commodity-producing sectors, services are estimated to have rebounded from last year's contraction to register growth of. percent, led by wholesale and retail trade. The MPC noted that the current economic recovery has been supported by proactive and well-calibrated policies of the Government and SBP since the Covid-shock. Given high public debt, targeted fiscal support was mainly delivered through reallocation of spending that focused on the most vulnerable, including through the Ehsaas program. This was enabled by the buffers that had been built up in the economic stabilization phase prior to the Covid pandemic, notably the primary surplus achieved through the first nine months of FY20. As result, the fiscal deficit in FY20 was contained and Pakistan witnessed one of the smallest increases in public debt across the world after the Covid-shock, supporting market sentiment and the investment outlook. On the monetary side, aggressive stimulus of percent of FY20 GDP was provided through one of the largest interest rate cuts in the world, time-bound liquidity relief to solvent borrowers in the form of principal deferment and loan restructuring, as well as new and temporary refinance facilities to prevent layoffs (Rozgar scheme), support health facilities, and promote investment (TERF). External sector. The MPC noted that, unlike several previous growth upturns in Pakistan, the current economic recovery has been achieved without compromising external stability. At $0. billion, the current account has remained in surplus through the first ten months of FY21 for the first time in 17 years. In recent months, imports have picked up with the economic recovery, rising international commodity prices, as well as one-off shipments of wheat and sugar to quell temporary domestic shortages. However this is being largely offset by record remittances, which rose to all-time highs in April on both monthly ($2. billion) and cumulative basis ($24. billion). In addition, exports have grown by almost 14 percent (y/y) so far this year, mainly due to high-value added textiles and favorable prices. In March. Pakistan successfully completed the combined 2nd-5th reviews of the IMF program and returned to international capital markets by raising $2. billion through an over- subscribed Eurobond, issued at yields below the initial price guidance. Together these positive external developments kept the PKR broadly stable since the last MPC meeting around its pre-Covid level, and saw SBP's foreign exchange reserves rise to almost $16 billion, four-year high. Looking ahead, the current account deficit is expected to remain bounded, modulated by the flexible exchange rate regime, and external financing needs should be comfortably met, further bolstering foreign exchange buffers. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Fiscal sector. As envisaged in this year's budget, fiscal consolidation has progressed well through the first three quarters of FY21. At. percent of GDP, the fiscal deficit is. percentage points lower than last year, despite higher interest payments and Covid-related expenses. Led by rebound in sales tax and direct taxes. FBR tax collection (net of refunds) has increased by 14 percent. Restrictions on supplementary grants and austerity measures have contained non-interest current expenditures, which grew by. percent, only around half the rate of last year. As result, the primary balance recorded percent of GDP surplus, its highest level through the first three quarters in 12 years. Monetary and inflation outlook 10. The MPC noted that financial conditions remain appropriately accommodative. Since the last meeting, market yields have declined in line with the forward guidance provided by the MPC and private sector credit has witnessed notable uptick, consistent with previous growth upturns. Cumulatively through April, the flow of private sector credit has grown by 43 percent (y/y), led by fixed investment and consumer loans, primarily due to the low interest rate environment and SBP's refinancing schemes, especially TERF and LTFF. Since the last MPC, headline inflation has risen further, mainly driven by supply shocks to food and energy, including the lingering impact of February's electricity tariff hikes. On sequential basis, upward momentum in certain food pricesânotably fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy, poultry, and edible oilâwas exacerbated by the advent of Ramzan, more than offsetting the recent decline in wheat prices. While core inflation has picked up in urban areas, price pressures are concentrated among relatively confined set of items and spare capacity still exists in the economy. Inflation expectations also remain reasonably anchored and wage growth is still muted. This suggests that second-round effects of the prevailing supply-shocks to inflation are not manifesting at the moment. As the economy gathers further momentum, it will be important to ensure that food price pressures are reversed through successful implementation of administrative measures to keep second-round effects in check. Looking ahead, the inflation trajectory will be affected by the path of domestic food and energy prices, this summer's round of wage negotiations, next year's budget, and the strength of the on-going economic recovery. As always, the MPC will continue to carefully monitor developments affecting the outlook for inflation, financial stability and growth. Page."
Israel,2021-05-31,"The rapid recovery of economic activity continues as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides in Israel. The deterioration in the security situation that lasted approximately 10 days apparently had only a limited negative impact. The significant increase in consumption continued even in the industries that were particularly hard hit by the restrictions during the COVID-19 crisis. The broad unemployment rate declined to 9.6 percent, and since the exit from the third lockdown in February, the modified employment rate has increased. Alongside this, some of the data indicate difficulties in the labor market's recovery process: the number of job vacancies continues to rise, alongside an increase in employers' difficulty in recruiting new workers in some industries. According to the first estimate of National Accounts data for the first quarter. GDP contracted byan annual rate of 6.5 percent, but first quarter data reflect a complex picture. In the first half of the quarter, the economy was under lockdown in view of peak morbidity rates from the pandemic, while the end of February and March featured a rapid exit from the crisis and recovery of the economy. First quarter GDP data were significantly impacted by vehicle imports that had been brought forward to the end of 2020 because of changes in tax rates, and by the shift of the timing of government expenditures on public consumption. Overall, the composition of uses shows a positive picture of the state of the economy. Home prices increased by a relatively rapid rate of 4.5 percent in the past 12 months. Investors' share of total home purchase transactions increased. However, the rate of increase of rental prices remained moderate. The inflation environment remains low, but is in an upward trend. The CPI increased by 0.3 percent inApril, and inflation in the past 12 months is 0.8 percent. According to assessments, the inflation rate is expected to reach the target range following the publication of the CPI reading for May. Inflation expectations for the coming year from all sources continued to increase, and are within the inflation target range. Medium- and long-term inflation expectations also increased, and are anchored at the midpoint of the target range. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 0.4 percent against the US dollar, and weakened by 0.5 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rateand by 1 percent against the euro. The deterioration in the security situation led to a short-lived increase in volatility. The vaccination campaign around the world is accelerating and supporting economic activity, but at the same time, there has been a worsening of morbidity in a number of emerging economies. Investment houses' growth forecasts for most of the major economies were revised upward. The prices of agricultural commodities, metals, and oil increased, and contributed to the continued increase in inflation. Monetary policy at the major central banks remains very accommodative. The return to normal life in Israel supports rapid growth in the coming year. However, there are still challenges to economic activity in view of the health risks in Israel and abroad and the impact tothe economy, particularly the labor market. The Committee will therefore continue to conduct a very accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time, usinga range of tools as necessary, including the interest rate tool, in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy targets and the recovery of the economy from the crisis, and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets.

However, there remains concern over the development of mutations that are resistant to the vaccinations or that would lead to more serious morbidity among the unvaccinated population, which constitutes a risk to the economy and to maintaining the almost full routine that the economy enters at the beginning of June. The deterioration in the security situation that lasted about 10 days apparently had only a limited impact onthe economic recovery process. The duration of the hostilities was relatively short, and as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, large parts of the economy have acclimated to remote work and consumption. In addition, a significant portion of the economic impact during similar incidents in the past was to tourism services exports, while such exports were already low due to the COVID-19 crisis. The available indicators regarding economic activity show a continued trend of improvement. The level of consumption through credit card transactions returned to, and even crossed, the trend line that was expected prior to the crisis (Figure 4). During the conflict, there was a transitory decline in credit card expenditures, but these expenditures recovered rapidly. The significant increase in consumption continued even in the industries that were particularly hard hit by the restrictions during the COVID-19 crisis (restaurants, tourism, leisure services, and education). Alongside the growth in domestic consumption, the increase in internal tourism is still not sufficient to compensate for the absence of incoming tourism. The hotels industry is still suffering from the significant adverse impact. Prior to the confrontation, the indices of mobility to stores increased to the highest level since the start of the pandemic. Mobility to work places has not yet returned to its precrisis level, both because employment has not yet completely recovered, and also due to the adoption of remote work arrangements at many workplaces (Figure 5). The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) Consumer Confidence Index increased sharply prior to the conflict, mainly due to the sharp improvement in the components of expectations of the state of the economy in the coming year. According to the CBS Business Tendency Survey for April, the aggregate net balance of the business sector continues its upward trend (Figure 3). In addition, accordingto the CBS's most recent real-time survey, the adverse impact on business revenue in March was the lowest since the start of the crisis. Labor Force Survey data for the first half of May indicate a decline in the broad unemployment rate to 9.6 percent (Figure 8). Since the exit from the third lockdown in February, there has been an increase in the modified employment rate (according to which those absent due to COVID-19-related reasons are not considered employed), and according to data from the first half of May, the rate is 57 percent. (The rate was about 61 percent in 2019.) (Figure 9). Alongside this, some of the data indicate difficulties in the labor market's recovery process. The number of job vacancies continues toclimb (Figure 10), and employers' difficulties in recruiting workers has alsoincreased. According to the Business Tendency Survey, there was a significant increase in the rate of manufacturing companies reporting difficulty in recruiting nonprofessional workers, to about 20 percent (Figure 11). Alongside this, it is possible that some of the difficulties are temporary due to the sharp and rapid exit from COVID-19-related restrictions to a full activity routine. According to the first estimate of National Accounts data for the first quarter. GDP contracted by an annual rate of 6.5 percent (Figure 1). The decline in that quarter was significantly impacted by vehicle purchases being brought forward to the end of 2020 because of tax changes, and by theshift of the timing of government expenditures on public consumption. According to a Research Department estimate, the contraction in GDP net of the decline in vehicle imports was only 3.2 percent. First quarter data reflect a complex picture.In the first half of the quarter, the economy was under lockdown in view of peak morbidity rates from the pandemic, while the end of February and March featured a sharp exit from the crisis and recovery of the economy. An examination ofthe components of uses shows a positive picture of the state of the economy. Private consumption excluding durable goods, investments in machinery and equipment, and exports all increased strongly (Figure 2). Services exports remained unchanged in recent months, but there is still an apparent continued upward trend, and its level is higher than it was prior to the crisis, despite the fact that tourism exports remain low. Dataon goods exports increased slightly in April and are remaining stable, following volatility during the crisis (Figure 6). Data on goods imports stabilized in April but remained high (Figure 7). As a result of the continuing ramifications of the COVID-19 crisis, there is a lack of equipment and raw materials, which is leading to difficulties in global economic activity. According to the Business Tendency Survey, this difficulty is having a particular impact on activity in the manufacturing and construction industries in Israel. The increase in orders for consumer goods and importsof goods for manufacturing, combined with the lack of manpower and storage space at the ports, are leading to difficulties in supply chains. Home prices increased by a relatively rapid rate of 4.5 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 22), in view of the moderation in the pace of building starts and building completions. In addition, there was an increase in construction input prices. At the same time, the pace of increase in rental prices remained moderate. New mortgage volume in April 2021 was NIS 8.3 billion, further tothe high mortgage volumes since the beginning of the year (Figure 23). The inflation environment remains low but the upward trend in the inflation rate continues. The CPI for April increased by 0.3 percent. Inflation in the past 12 months was 0.8 percent (0.5 percent net of energy and fruit and vegetables) (Figure 14), and according to assessments, it is expected to reach the target range following the publication of the May CPI reading. The prices of tradable goods increased sharply, in view of the increase in energy prices, while the rate of change in the prices of nontradable components ofthe CPI remained moderate (Figure 15). Inflation expectations increased against the background of the rapid recovery in economic activity and the accommodative policy, the increases in the prices of raw materials, the increase in maritime shipping costs, and the increase in the global inflation environment. Inflation expectations for the coming year from all sources continued to increase, and are within the target range. In particular, expectations derived from the capital market and from inflation contracts are near the midpoint of the range (Figure 16). Medium- and long-term expectations also increased, and are anchored at the midpoint of the target range (Figure 17). Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 0.4 percent against the US dollar, and weakened by 0.5 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate and by 1 percent and against the euro (Figure 18). The security escalation led to only a short-lived increase in volatility. In thecapital markets, the upward trend in equity prices continues and corporate bond spreads remained unchanged at a level close to their precrisis level (Figure 21). The yields on CPI-indexed government bonds declined, while the yields on nominal bonds increased. The credit market continues to function well with stable and low interest rates, supported bya range of steps taken by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance (Figures 24-25). According to the Business Tendency Survey, in March andApril, there was a mixed trend in firms' difficulty in obtaining credit. There was an increase in the difficulty in obtaining credit among small businesses, while large businesses reported a decline in this difficulty. There was stability among all company sizes in obtaining nonbank credit. From an industry standpoint, the average level of difficulty in obtaining credit returned toits precrisis level in all industries except hotels, where there was a sharp decline in the difficulty in March, but companies are still reporting relatively high levels of difficulty in obtaining credit. Globally, the pace of vaccinations is accelerating and supporting economic activity. However, there was a worsening of morbidity in a number of emerging economies. Investment houses' growth forecasts for most ofthe major economies were revised upward (Figure 26). The consolidated global Purchasing Managers Index for April increased to its highest level in the past decade (Figure 28), and the expansion of activity was reflected in both the services and manufacturing components. The major equity indices were characterized by a mixed trend during the period, but remain at record high levels (Figure 38). The pricing of some financial assets may not necessarily reflect all of the risks. The prices of agricultural commodities, metals, and oil increased, in view of the supply limitations and increased demand, and contributed to the continued increase in inflation, but inflation expectations remained near the central bank targets. Monetary policies at the major central banks remained very accommodative. In contrast, the interest rate increases in the emerging economies continue in view of the increase in inflation. In the US, the rapid economic growth continues and the sentiment indices point to continued rapid improvement in activity. Despite this, the employment report indicated a slowdown in the pace of job additions. In Europe, economic activity contracted in the first quarter of the year, but the acceleration in the pace of vaccinations in the population, alongside the decline in morbidity and expectations of the launch of a fiscal program in the second half of the year led to improved sentiment indices and an upward revision of the growth forecasts. The Chinese economy continues to expand, but the expansion has slowed to close to its precrisis pace. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on June 14, 2021. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. July 5, 2021, followed by a press briefing by the Governor."
India,2021-06-04,"Monetary Policy Statement, 2021-22 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) June 2-4, 2021 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (June 4, 2021) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Since the MPC's meeting in April, the global economic recovery has been gaining momentum, driven mainly by major advanced economies (AEs) and powered by massive vaccination programmes and stimulus packages. Activity remains uneven in major emerging market economies (EMEs), with downside risks from renewed waves of infections due to 12021 placed India's real gross domestic product (GDP) contraction at 7.3 per cent for 2020-21, with GDP growth in Q4 at 1.6 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y). On June 1, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast a normal south-west monsoon, with rainfall at 101 per cent of the long period average (LPA). This augurs well for agriculture. With the rise in infections in rural areas, however, indicators of rural demand  tractor sales and two-wheeler sales  posted sequential declines during April. Industrial production registered a broad-based improvement in March 2021. While mining and electricity output surpassed March 2019 (pre-pandemic) levels, manufacturing did not catch up. The output of core industries registered a double digit y-o-y growth in April 2021, propelled by a weak base. Although GST collections were at their highest during April 2021, there are indications of moderation in May as reflected in lower E-way bills generation. Other high-frequency indicators  electricity generation; railway freight traffic; port cargo; steel consumption; cement production; and toll collections  recorded sequential moderation during April-May 2021, reflecting the impact of restrictions and localised lockdowns imposed by states with exemptions for specific activities. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) remained in expansion in May although it moderated to 50.8 from 55.5 in April due to a slowdown in output and new orders. The services PMI, which was 54.0 in April, entered into contraction (46.4) in May, after seven months of sustained expansion. Headline inflation registered a moderation to 4.3 per cent in April from 5.5 per cent in March, largely on favourable base effects. Food inflation fell to 2.7 per cent in April from 5.2 per cent in March, with prices of cereals, vegetables and sugar continuing to decline on a y- o-y basis. While fuel inflation surged, core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation moderated in April across most sub-groups barring housing and health, mainly due to base effects. Inflation in transport and communication remained in double digits. 23) and bank credit grew by 9.9 per cent and 6.0 per cent, respectively, as on May 21, 2021 as compared with growth of 11.7 per cent and 6.2 per cent, respectively, a year ago. India's foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 21.2 billion in 2021-22 (up to May 28) to US$ 598.2 billion. Outlook 7. Going forward, the inflation trajectory is likely to be shaped by uncertainties impinging on the upside and the downside. The rising trajectory of international commodity prices, especially of crude, together with logistics costs, pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. Excise duties, cess and taxes imposed by the Centre and States need to be adjusted in a coordinated manner to contain input cost pressures emanating from petrol and diesel prices. A normal south-west monsoon along with comfortable buffer stocks should help to keep cereal price pressures in check. Recent supply side interventions are expected to ameliorate the tightness in the pulses market. Further supply side measures are needed to soften pressures on pulses and edible oil prices. With declining infections, restrictions and localised lockdowns across states could ease gradually and mitigate disruptions to supply chains, reducing cost pressures. Weak demand conditions may also temper the pass-through to core inflation. Taking into consideration all these factors. CPI inflation is projected at 5.1 per cent during 2021-22: 5.2 per cent in Q1; 5.4 per cent in Q2; 4.7 per cent in Q3; and 5.3 per cent in Q4:2021- 22; with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1). Turning to the growth outlook, rural demand remains strong and the expected normal monsoon bodes well for sustaining its buoyancy, going forward. The increased spread of COVID-19 infections in rural areas, however, poses downside risks. Urban demand has been dented by the second wave, but adoption of new COVID-compatible occupational models by businesses for an appropriate working environment may cushion the hit to economic activity, especially in manufacturing and services sectors that are not contact intensive. On the other hand, the strengthening global recovery should support the export sector. Domestic monetary and financial conditions remain highly accommodative and supportive of economic activity. Moreover, the vaccination process is expected to gather steam in the coming months and should help to normalise economic activity quickly. Taking these factors into consideration, real GDP growth is now projected at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22, consisting of 18.5 per cent in Q1; 7.9 per cent in Q2; 7.2 per cent in Q3; and 6.6 per cent in Q4:2021-22 (Chart 2). 34 per cent and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. All members of the MPC  Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma. Dr.Mridul K. Saggar. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das  unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Furthermore, all members of the MPC unanimously voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published on June 18, 2021. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during August 4 to 6, 2021.

Kazakhstan,2021-06-07,"Press Release 10 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.00% June 7, 2021 Nur-Sultan The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to set the base rate at 9.00% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1.0 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities set on 10.00% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 8.00% The decision was made based on the balance of inflation risks in the short and medium term perspective. There is a continuation of external inflationary pressure caused by the growth of world food prices and the acceleration of inflation in the countries-trading partners of Kazakhstan. In the domestic economy, the process of gradual recovery of business activity and consumer demand continues. The main risks of inflation in Kazakhstan in the medium term are associated with stronger fiscal stimulus of the economy, further growth of domestic prices for fuel and lubricants, higher food inflation as a result of increasing prices on world markets and the emergence of imbalances in the domestic food market, as well as the incentives' winding down by central banks in developed countries. At the end of May 2021, the annual inflation rate was 7.2%. The increase in prices for non- food products and paid services was partially leveled by disinflationary processes in the food market. Food inflation continued to slow down and at the end of May 2021 amounted to 9.3% (9.8% in April 2021). Its current slowdown is associated with excluding from calculation of the high inflation base in 2020. Wherein, the price growth trend in some commodity markets continues. Additional pro- inflationary pressure is exerted by the continuing rise in world food prices for 12 months. In May 2021, there was a sharp increase in the FAO food price index - the value amounted to 127.1 points (an increase of 39.7%, y/y), due to a jump in prices for vegetable oils, sugar and cereals, with a moderate increase in prices for meat and dairy products. The non-food component of inflation accelerated to 6.7% in May 2021 (6.4% in April 2021) as a result of rising prices for fuel and lubricants, clothing and footwear. The increase in the price of fuel and lubricants is due to the increase in producer prices, the recovery of economic activity and the delayed effect of the change in the excise tax rate in 2020. The annual increase in prices for paid services to the population at the end of May 2021 was 5.1% (4.1% in April 2021). There is an increase in prices for utilities (electricity, garbage collection) and passenger transport services. At the same time, in April-May 2021, there is an increase in prices for certain unregulated services amid the background of increased demand given the easing quarantine restrictions and mass population vaccination. The population's inflation expectations have decreased as a result of the reduction of uncertainty in the respondents' responses given the improved economic situation and mass vaccination. In May 2021, the quantitative estimate of inflation for the year ahead was 6.6% (7.2% in April 2021). The share of respondents expecting the current price growth to continue over the next 12 months has increased to 42% (in April 2021 - 26%). According to the National Bank estimates, a decline in the inflation slowdown rate may result in outpace of the target range of 4-6% by the end of 2021. The main factors of the inflation forecast revision were the increase in prices for fuel and lubricants based on the results of 5 months of 2021, the increase in tariffs of energy-producing organizations, as well as the preservation of external inflationary pressure. Wherein, the impact of the additional fiscal impulse associated with the republican budget refinement will be redistributed between 2021 and 2022. Given the non- anchored inflation expectations, a high probability of the secondary inflationary effects realization from short-term pro-inflationary factors is noted. This may eventually lead to a longer period of slowing inflation to the targeted range. In 2022, the effect of the above-mentioned factors of the internal environment and the weakening of external inflationary pressure is expected to be exhausted. Inflation in China and the EU is not expected to reach its target levels, and inflation in Russia is expected to stabilize at 4%, given a gradual decline in world food prices. Given the high share of food and non-food imports from the main trading partner countries, the gradual stabilization of inflation in these countries will contribute to slowÄ±ng down of inflation in Kazakhstan and its entering the target range of 4-6%. The situation in the real sector of the economy continues to gradually improve. According to the results of January-April 2021. GDP growth was 0.7% in annual terms. A recovery in trade (an increase of 5.7%) and transport (a decline rate slowdown to -9.0%) is being observed. Growth acceleration is mentioned in manufacturing (7.7%), construction (12.5%), information and communications (11.1%). A recovery in consumer activity of the population is observed. This is confirmed by the acceleration of the dynamics of retail turnover in January-April 2021, which for the first time since March 2020 entered the growth zone (6.2% YoY). The support for household consumption growth in the first quarter of 2021 was provided by a rise in real per capita income of the population by 3.4% as a result of a growth in salaries of employees and an increase in budget spending on pensions and scholarships. The situation in the global economy is developing positively. Owing to the improvement in the epidemiological situation in the world due to the introduction of more than 2 billion doses of vaccine, a gradual easing of quarantine restrictions began in countries with a high level of vaccination. The given factor, along with the rapid current economic growth of a number of large countries, has led to a revision of the forecasts made by international organizations regarding the development of the world economy. The IMF raised its forecast for global economic growth from 5.5% to 6.0% for 2021. The IMF forecasts for the countries-trading partners of Kazakhstan were also revised upward. As a result of the deployment of vaccination programs and the lifting of restrictive measures, the EU economy is expected to grow by 4.4% in 2021. According to the forecast. China's GDP will grow by 8.4%, but the pressure on economic growth may arise from the observed current supply problems 2 and rising raw material costs. In line with the forecasts the Russian economy will grow by 3.8% this year. The acceleration of inflationary processes in the main trading partner countries of Kazakhstan is observed. In China, in April 2021, the annual inflation speeded up to 0.9%, while forming below the target of 3%. In the EU, in April 2021, price increases reached 2%, forming at the target level. In Russia, after a peak reached in March 2021 as a result of increased inflationary pressures due to expanding demand, the annual inflation in April 2021 settled at 5.5%. In the world's largest economy, the United States, inflation accelerated to 4.2%, reflecting the global trend of accelerating consumer inflation in view of the recovery in economic activity and continued fiscal stimulus. The situation in the global oil market continues to improve. At the beginning of June this year Brent crude oil prices exceeded $71 per barrel. Fundamentally, prices are underpinned by rapid growth in demand as a result of vaccinations carried out by countries, as well as a more restrained supply of oil from OPEC+ countries due to the decision to gradually increase oil production in the near term. According to EIA estimates, as a result of the expected gradual increase in oil production in non-OPEC+ countries, the oil price will slightly decrease from current values after the second quarter of 2021. During 2021-2022, the price of Brent crude oil will be around $60 per barrel. Taking into account the current epidemiological situation in the world and forecasts of international organizations, the National Bank, under the baseline scenario of the current forecast round, revised the price of Brent crude oil, increasing it to $60 on average in 2021-2022. According to the updated forecasts of the National Bank, the estimates for the growth of the economy of Kazakhstan were revised upward. In 2021, economic growth is expected at the level of 3.6-3.9%, in 2022 - in the range of 4.0-4.3%. The main factors behind the revision were the higher scenario oil price and the expansion of the positive fiscal impulse due to the upward revision of budget expenditures in the current year. A faster recovery of business activity in the economy and an increase in real incomes of the population will contribute to the expansion of aggregate demand, which will become a driver of economic growth. However, a restraining effect on the dynamics of GDP will be delivered from the gradual growth of imports. The recovery in exports in the second half of 2021 will be stipulated by an increase in oil production as OPEC+ restrictions are softened and an increase in external demand for Kazakhstan's export goods. Further acceleration of economic growth in 2022 will be assisted by the maintenance of growth pace of domestic demand in light of an improving epidemiological situation and an expansion of exports as restrictions are further eased under the OPEC+ deal. The current level of the base rate allows maintaining control over the dynamics of inflationary processes and ensuring a gradual decrease in annual inflation in the medium term. The monetary conditions will strive to neutral values in the medium term as inflation slows down. The subsequent decisions on the base rate will be made in account of the compliance of actual inflation with its targets, the dynamics of inflation expectations, the rate of recovery in demand, as well as the balance of inflation risks in the domestic and foreign markets. In case of risks realization from the side of pro-inflationary factors and slower dynamics of disinflation in comparison with the forecast estimates, the National Bank will take a decision to tighten monetary conditions. The next planned decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on July 26, 2021 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time. 3 More detailed information for mass media is available upon request: +7 (7172) 77 52 10 e-mail: press@nationalbank.kz 4."
Chile,2021-06-08,"NoPtrae sdse R eplereasnes*a Tuesday, 8 June 2021 Monetary Policy Meeting  June 2021 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of the Board members. In the external scenario, short-term activity indicators have confirmed an ongoing recovery, especially in the developed economies. This has been linked to the progress of vaccinations and the gradual reopening in these countries, strengthening the outlook of consumers and companies. The financial markets, in general, continue to reflect this outlook with rising stock market prices in the main economies and widespread appreciation of assets and commodities: the copper price is now bordering US$4.5 per pound. In the emerging economies, beyond the strong Chinese economy, the slower rate of vaccinations and the difficulties in the sanitary control have hindered the recovery process. In Chile, the performance of financial markets continues to be particularly affected by idiosyncratic elements, showing a decoupling from global trends and an increase in volatility. Worth noting is the fall of the IPSA and the rise of the 10-year nominal rate, which has increased by nearly 70 basis points since the last meeting, at the same time that the sovereign spread (CDS) rose to its highest of several months. The peso/dollar parity accumulates a slight depreciation. In April, the Imacec âadjusted by seasonalityâ was again a positive surprise, as it recorded a month-on-month decline that was less pronounced than expected. Basically, this is new proof of the successful adaptation of the economic agents in operating in the context of a pandemic. However, some economic sectors continue to lag behind. On the expenditure side, the dynamism of consumption âespecially of durable goodsâ and the rebound of the machinery and equipment component of investment stand out. The labor market continues to exhibit heterogeneous improvement, with self-employment and informal salaried employment, low- skilled workers and women lagging the furthest behind. Meanwhile, the number of pension fund and unemployment insurance contributors has returned to pre-pandemic levels, indicating that formal salaried employment has benefited more from the economy's recovery. Since the release of the March Monetary Policy Report, the fiscal stimulus has been significantly extended, which couples with the approval of a third pension savings withdrawal. This additional boost to private spending, and the better adaptation of the economy, significantly improve the outlook for activity in 2021, in a context of somewhat more favorable external conditions. As for banking credit, the activity of the Fogape-Reactiva program continues to increase. However, on aggregate, the annual change in commercial loans is negative, which is largely explained by the comparison base effect. The latter is influenced by the boost provided by the Covid lines during 2020. On the household side, it must be noted that the annual contraction of the consumer portfolio has continued to shrink, while the growth of mortgage loans shows no major changes. Lending interest rates have remained at low levels across the board. The annual variation rates of both headline and core CPI âwithout volatilesâ have risen, and currently stand at around 3.5%. The latest indicators highlight price increases in fuels and the goods component of inflation. The latter continue to be affected by strong demand, in a context in which some inventories have yet to be fully replenished, and global production and Nota de prensa transportation costs have risen significantly. One- and two-year-ahead expectations continue to be around 3% annually. The Board estimates that the economy is still affected by the impact on the recovery of the pandemic and the lagging labor market. However, the strong dynamism already present in consumption and the additional boost to private spending are an important change for the macroeconomic scenario of the coming months, which makes it necessary to recalibrate the expansiveness of monetary policy going forward. This issue is addressed in the June Monetary Policy Report to be published tomorrow. Regarding unconventional measures, just recently phase 3 of the FCIC facility was completed. Also, in the first days of June the period of reinvestment of bank bond coupons concluded. From now onwards, the stock will be gradually reduced as the assets in the portfolio are extinguished. The June Monetary Policy Report containing the projections and analyses that support these Board decisions, together with the reestimation of the structural parameters, will be published tomorrow. Wednesday 9 June at 9:00 hours. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be released at 8:30 hours of Wednesday 23 June 2021. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will take place on Tuesday 13 and Wednesday 14 July 2021, and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours of this latter date. ____The Spanish original prevails.

Poland,2021-06-09,"Warsaw, 9 June 2021 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 9 June 2021 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 0.10%; lombard rate at 0.50%; deposit rate at 0.00%; rediscount rate at 0.11%; discount rate at 0.12%. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. The timing and scale of the conducted measures will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. The recent period has seen an improvement in the pandemic situation around the world. The gradual easing of sanitary restrictions has led to an improvement in business conditions in the services sector in many economies, including in the euro area. Economic indicators in industry suggest a further recovery in activity in this sector alongside supply restrictions in certain markets. The prices of many commodities, in particular oil, are currently significantly higher than a year ago. Along with the supply-side disruptions related to the pandemic, this is exerting an upward pressure on global inflation, including in advanced economies. However, due to still weak economic conditions and uncertainty about the economic outlook, major central banks are keeping interest rates low and conducting asset purchases as well as signalling that loose monetary policy will be maintained in the future. In Poland, annual GDP growth remained negative in 2021 Q1 and amounted to -0.9%. At the same time, growth in both consumption and investment was slightly positive. The incoming data indicate a further improvement in economic conditions, with persisting differences between sectors. In April 2021, the annual industrial output growth and retail sales growth rose significantly, which was to a large extent due to base effects related to the fall in these categories a year ago. However, while industrial output was higher than before the pandemic, retail sales still did not reach this level. Alongside that, annual growth in construction and assembly output remained clearly negative. This was accompanied by an increase in average employment in the enterprise sector in annual terms and in annual average wage growth in this sector, which, however, was the result of statistical base effects. Available forecasts indicate that the coming quarters will see a recovery in economic activity, although its scale and pace are highly uncertain. The further course of the pandemic and its impact on economic situation in Poland and abroad continues to be the main source of uncertainty. The economic policy measures, including the easing of NBP's monetary policy introduced last year and the expected recovery in the global economy, will have a positive impact on the domestic economic situation. The pace of the economic recovery in Poland will also depend on further developments of the zloty exchange rate. According to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, inflation in Poland stood at 4.8% y/y in May 2021 (in monthly terms it amounted to 0.3%). The increase in inflation in May was mainly driven by the further rise in annual fuel price growth related to the significantly higher global oil prices than a year ago, as well as the rise in food prices. At the same time, the annual inflation rate continued to be pushed up by the increase in electricity prices at the beginning of 2021, as well as the increases in waste disposal charges, i.e. by the factors that  similarly to growing commodity prices  are beyond the control of domestic monetary policy. The growing costs of running business amidst the pandemic, including higher international transport charges and temporary disruptions in supply chains, also continue to add to inflation. The above-mentioned factors will probably translate into annual price growth staying above the upper band for deviations from the inflation target in the coming months. At the same time, next year  after the factors temporarily increasing price growth fade  inflation is expected to decrease. Price developments next year will depend on the robustness of economic recovery, including the situation in the labour market following phasing-out of the anti-crisis measures. As indicated in Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2021, due to the macroeconomic and financial shocks, inflation may temporarily deviate from the target and even run outside the band for deviations from the target. The response of monetary policy to the shocks is flexible and depends on their causes and the assessment of persistence of their effects, including their impact on inflation developments. NBP's monetary policy supports the consolidation of economic recovery following the pandemic-induced recession and stabilises inflation at the level consistent with the NBP's inflation target in the medium term. Taking into account the sources and the expected temporary nature of inflation exceeding the NBP's target, as well as the uncertainty about the persistence and scale of the economic recovery. NBP is keeping interest rates unchanged. At the same time. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in the secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP's interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In order to strengthen the impact of the NBP's monetary policy easing on the economy. NBP may also intervene in the foreign exchange market. The timing and scale of the measures taken by NBP will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also continue to offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks."
Euroarea,2021-06-10,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of the meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. After the contraction in the first quarter of the year, the euro area economy is gradually reopening as the pandemic situation improves and vaccination campaigns make significant progress. The latest data signal a bounce-back in services activity and ongoing dynamism in manufacturing production. We expect economic activity to accelerate in the second half of this year as further containment measures are lifted. A pick-up in consumer spending, strong global demand and accommodative fiscal and monetary policies will lend crucial support to the recovery. At the same time, uncertainties remain, as the near-term economic outlook continues to depend on the course of the pandemic and on how the economy responds after reopening. Inflation has picked up over recent months, largely on account of base effects, transitory factors and an increase in energy prices. It is expected to rise further in the second half of the year, before declining as temporary factors fade out. Our new staff projections point to a gradual increase in underlying inflation pressures throughout the projection horizon, although the pressures remain subdued in the context of still significant economic slack that will only be absorbed gradually over the projection horizon. Headline inflation is expected to remain below our aim over the projection horizon. Preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period remains essential to reduce uncertainty and bolster confidence, thereby underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability. Financing conditions for firms and households have remained broadly stable since our monetary policy meeting in March. While partly reflecting improved economic prospects, a sustained rise in market rates could translate into a tightening of wider financing conditions that are relevant for the entire economy. Such a tightening would be premature and would pose a risk to the ongoing economic recovery and the outlook for inflation. Against this background, the Governing Council decided to confirm its very accommodative monetary policy stance. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 per cent within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. We will continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of â¬1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. Based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council expects net purchases under the PEPP over the coming quarter to continue to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year. We will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy. If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation. We will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. Net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of â¬20 billion. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Finally, we will continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. The funding obtained through the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO plays a crucial role in supporting bank lending to firms and households. Our measures help to preserve favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy, which is needed for a sustained economic recovery and for safeguarding price stability. We will also continue to monitor developments in the exchange rate with regard to their possible implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards our aim in a sustained manner, in line with our commitment to symmetry. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. In the first quarter of the year, euro area real GDP declined further, by 0.3 per cent, to stand 5.1 per cent below its pre-pandemic level of the fourth quarter of 2019. Business and consumer surveys and high-frequency indicators point to a sizeable improvement in activity in the second quarter of this year. Business surveys indicate a strong recovery in services activity as infection numbers decline, which will allow a gradual normalisation of high-contact activities. Manufacturing production remains robust, supported by solid global demand, although supply-side bottlenecks could pose some headwinds for industrial activity in the near term. Indicators of consumer confidence are strengthening, suggesting a strong rebound in private consumption in the period ahead. Business investment shows resilience, despite weaker corporate balance sheets and the still uncertain economic outlook. We expect growth to continue to improve strongly in the second half of 2021 as progress in vaccination campaigns allows a further relaxation of containment measures. Over the medium term, the recovery in the euro area economy is expected to be buoyed by stronger global and domestic demand, as well as by continued support from both monetary policy and fiscal policy. This assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the June 2021 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP growth at 4.6 per cent in 2021, 4.7 per cent in 2022 and 2.1 per cent in 2023. Compared with the March 2021 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for economic activity has been revised up for 2021 and 2022, while it is unchanged for 2023. Overall, we see the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook as broadly balanced. On the one hand, an even stronger recovery could be predicated on brighter prospects for global demand and a faster-than-anticipated reduction in household savings once social and travel restrictions have been lifted. On the other hand, the ongoing pandemic, including the spread of virus mutations, and its implications for economic and financial conditions continue to be sources of downside risk. According to Eurostat's flash release, euro area annual inflation increased from 1.3 per cent in March to 1.6 per cent in April and 2.0 per cent in May 2021. This rise was due mainly to a strong increase in energy price inflation, reflecting both sizeable upward base effects as well as month-on-month increases, and, to a lesser extent, a slight increase in non-energy industrial goods inflation. Headline inflation is likely to increase further towards the autumn, reflecting mainly the reversal of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany. Inflation is expected to decline again at the start of next year as temporary factors fade out and global energy prices moderate. We expect underlying price pressures to increase somewhat this year owing to temporary supply constraints and the recovery in domestic demand. Nevertheless, the price pressures will likely remain subdued overall, in part reflecting low wage pressures, in the context of still significant economic slack, and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate. Once the impact of the pandemic fades, the unwinding of the high level of slack, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, will contribute to a gradual increase in underlying inflation over the medium term. Survey-based measures and market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remain at subdued levels, although market-based indicators have continued to increase. This assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the June 2021 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresees annual inflation at 1.9 per cent in 2021, 1.5 per cent in 2022 and 1.4 per cent in 2023. Compared with the March 2021 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for inflation has been revised up for 2021 and 2022, largely owing to temporary factors and higher energy price inflation. It is unchanged for 2023, as the increase in underlying inflation is largely counterbalanced by an expected decline in energy price inflation. HICP inflation excluding energy and food is projected to increase from 1.1 per cent in 2021 to 1.3 per cent in 2022 and 1.4 per cent in 2023, revised up throughout the projection horizon compared with the March 2021 projection exercise. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of broad money (M3) declined to 9.2 per cent in April 2021, from 10.0 per cent in March and 12.3 per cent in February. The deceleration in March and April was due partly to strong negative base effects as the large inflows in the initial phase of the pandemic crisis dropped out of the annual growth statistics. It also reflects a moderation in shorter-term monetary dynamics, mainly originating from weaker developments in deposits by households and firms in April and lower liquidity needs as the pandemic situation improves. The ongoing asset purchases by the Eurosystem continue to be the largest source of money creation. While also decelerating, the narrow monetary aggregate M1 has remained the main contributor to broad money growth. Its strong contribution is consistent with a still heightened preference for liquidity in the money-holding sector and a low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid forms of money. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector declined to 3.2 per cent in April, from 3.6 per cent in March and 4.5 per cent in February. This decline took place amid opposing dynamics in lending to non-financial corporations and to households. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations fell to 3.2 per cent in April, after 5.3 per cent in March and 7.0 per cent in February. The contraction reflects large negative base effects and some frontloading in loan creation in March relative to April. The annual growth rate of loans to households rose to 3.8 per cent in April, after 3.3 per cent in March and 3.0 per cent in February, supported by solid monthly flows and positive base effects. Overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments and other European institutions, remain essential to support bank lending conditions and access to financing, in particular for those most affected by the pandemic. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary to support economic activity and the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 per cent over the medium term. Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains crucial, as a premature withdrawal of fiscal support would risk weakening the recovery and amplifying the longer-term scarring effects. National fiscal policies should thus continue to provide critical and timely support to the firms and households most exposed to the ongoing pandemic and the associated containment measures. At the same time, fiscal measures should remain temporary and countercyclical, while ensuring that they are sufficiently targeted in nature to address vulnerabilities effectively and to support a swift recovery in the euro area economy. The three safety nets endorsed by the European Council for workers, businesses and governments provide important funding support. The Governing Council reiterates the key role of the Next Generation EU package. It calls on Member States to deploy the funds productively, accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural policies. This would allow the Next Generation EU programme to contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery and would increase economic resilience as well as the growth potential of Member States' economies. In doing so, the programme would support the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. Such structural policies are particularly important in improving economic structures and institutions and in accelerating the green and digital transitions."
Peru,2021-06-10,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT JUNE 2021 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation increased from 2.38 percent in April to 2.45 percent in May due to supply- side pressures. Trend inflation remains at the lower part of the target range. Year-on- year core inflation was 1.8 percent in May. Inflation is expected to remain within the target range throughout 2021 and 2022; and to lie at the lower part of the range during 2022, as economic activity will remain below its potential level. One-year-ahead expected inflation was 2.4 percent in May. Most leading indicators improved in May. Global economic recovery is expected to be more pronounced in the next quarters, as the vaccination process continues around the world, and significant stimulus packages are implemented in developed countries. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows, and stands ready to expand monetary stimulus using a range of instruments. Financial markets were highly volatile in a context of electoral uncertainty and the BCRP's actions were intended to mitigate this volatility. As of June 9. BCRP injection operations totaled S/ 56,670 million, of which S/ 48,870 million were associated with government-backed repos. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on July 8, 2021."
Russia,2021-06-11,"On 11 June 2021, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to increase the key rate by 50 b.p., to 5.50% per annum. Both the Russian and global economies are recovering faster than expected. Inflation is developing above the Bank of Russia's forecast. The contribution of persistent factors to inflation is increasing due to faster growth of demand compared to output expansion capacity. Over a short-term horizon, this influence is strengthened by price growth in global commodity markets. Taking into account high inflation expectations, the balance of risks has significantly shifted towards proinflationary ones. Increased inflationary pressure in the context of the completing economic recovery can lead to a more substantial and prolonged deviation of inflation upward from the target. This creates the necessity of further increases in the key rate at upcoming meetings. Key rate decisions will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will return to the Bank of Russia's target in the second half of 2022 and will remain close to 4% further on. Inflation dynamics. Inflation is developing above the Bank of Russia's forecast. In May, seasonally adjusted consumer price growth accelerated significantly, with annual inflation growing to 6.0% (vs 5.5% in April). According to estimates as of 7 June, annual inflation went up to 6.15%. Based on the Bank of Russia's estimates, indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements also rose in May and substantially exceed 4% (annualised). This largely reflects the fact that steady growth in domestic demand exceeds supply expansion capacity in a wide range of sectors. In this context, businesses find it easier to transfer higher costs to prices. During the recent months, inflation expectations of households have remained close to their highest level for the last four years. Businesses' price expectations continue to grow, holding above the local highs of 20192020. Analysts' medium-term expectations are anchored close to 4%. Given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will return to the Bank of Russia's target in the second half of 2022 and will remain close to 4% further on. Monetary conditions remain accommodative given elevated inflation expectations and actual inflation. In this context, lending continues to grow at rates close to recent years' highs. At the same time, yields of short-term OFZs rose, reflecting the expectations of a faster-than-expected key rate hike by the Bank of Russia. A trend towards growth in deposit interest rates is also emerging. The Bank of Russia's decisions to increase the key rate and the rise in OFZ yields observed since the beginning of the year will create prerequisites for further growth in loan and deposit rates. This will make it possible to raise the attractiveness of bank deposits for households, protect the purchasing power of savings, and ensure balanced lending expansion. Economic activity is recovering faster than expected by the Bank of Russia. High-frequency indicators point to steady growth of consumer and investment demand. According to the Bank of Russia's estimates, consumer activity has generally reached its pre-pandemic levels. The household services sector continues to recover actively. The Bank of Russia estimates that output has exceeded its pre-pandemic levels in most sectors of the economy. Demand for labour force is growing in a wide range of industries, with certain sectors experiencing a deficit. The Russian economy is also supported by external demand. The prospects for global economic recovery are improving amid gradual normalisation of epidemic conditions in the world. In turn, this drives prices in global commodity markets higher. Bank of Russia estimates suggest that in these conditions the Russian economy will recover to pre-crisis levels as soon as 2021 Q2. The medium-term path of economic growth will largely depend both on domestic and external conditions. Domestic demand movements will be predominantly shaped by the rate of growth in consumer and investment demand. Consumer demand will be supported by a further decline in households' propensity to save along with an increase in incomes and lending. Domestic demand will also be influenced by the process of fiscal policy normalisation in view of the announced additional social and infrastructural measures. External demand movements will be mostly dependent on fiscal support measures in individual advanced economies as well as the pace of vaccination world-wide. Inflation risks. The balance of risks has significantly shifted towards proinflationary ones. Their effect could be strengthened by elevated inflation expectations and corresponding secondary effects. Inflationary pressures may originate from a stronger-than-expected decline in households' propensity to save, propelled by the combination of low interest rates and growing prices. Further upward pressure on prices may continue to come from remaining disruptions in production and supply chains. Proinflationary risks are further generated by price movements in global commodity markers, driven by both supply and demand factors. This may pass through to domestic prices for corresponding goods. At the same time, further movements of food prices will largely depend on agricultural harvest prospects both in Russia and abroad. Short-term proinflationary risks are also associated with the stronger volatility in global markets caused in part by various geopolitical developments, which may affect exchange rate and inflation expectations. Also, given that the global economic recovery is progressing at faster paces than previously expected and the need is no longer in place for unprecedentedly accommodative policies in advanced economies, an earlier monetary policy normalisation in these countries is possible. This may become a further driver of volatility growth in global financial markets. Disinflationary risks for the baseline scenario remain moderate. Opening up the borders concurrently with a gradual lifting of restrictions may lead to a recovery in the consumption of foreign services and weaken supply-side constraints in the labour market owing to an inflow of foreign labour force. Subsequent economic growth may be held back by, among other things, low vaccination rates and the spread of new coronavirus strains, as well as the ensuing tightening of restrictions. Medium-term inflation is largely influenced by fiscal policy. In its baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia proceeds from the fiscal policy normalisation path stipulated by the Guidelines for Fiscal. Tax and Customs and Tariff Policy for 2021 and the 20222023 Planning Period, which assumes a return to fiscal rule parameters in 2022. The Bank of Russia' forecast will also factor in the impact of the decisions to invest the liquid part of the National Wealth Fund in excess of the threshold level of 7% of GDP. Increased inflationary pressure in the context of the completing economic recovery can lead to a more substantial and prolonged deviation of inflation upward from the target. This creates the necessity of further increases in the key rate at the upcoming meetings. Key rate decisions will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 23 July 2021. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the Bank of Russia's medium-term forecast are to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Armenia,2021-06-15,"PRESS RELEASE 15.06.2021 At the June 15, 2021 meeting, the CBA Board decided to raise the refinancing rate by 0.5 pp, setting it at 6.5%. Deflation of 0.4% was recorded in May 2021 compared with deflation of 0.1% registered in the same month of the previous year, in which case the 12-month inflation has decreased to 5.9%. The 12-month core inflation kept on accelerating, reaching 7.4% at the end of May. In the second quarter of 2021, the economic activity and demand in the main partner countries of Armenia are recovering at higher than expected rates thanks to the positive impact of the use of coronavirus vaccines and the implementation of considerably stimulative policies. Because of a rapid growth of global demand and restricted supply in a number of product markets, high inflationary conditions are persisting in international commodity and food markets. Driven by the abovementioned supply and demand factors, higher inflation rates are projected in the partner countries as compared to the previous estimates. In such a situation, the CBA Board is expecting a significant inflationary impact from the external sector on the Armenian economy. The current developments of 2021 indicate faster-than-expected recovery trends in the Armenian economic growth, largely determined by more positive developments in industry and services. In addition, aggregate demand is recovering faster than expected, mainly due to a rapid growth of global demand, increased remittances, and a high growth rate of private consumption, while private investment remains sluggish. The higher growth of private consumption is supported by more positive developments in lending and conditioned by spending of previously accumulated savings by households, so reflecting also the increased inflation expectations of the public. As a result, with demand growing at a faster rate than production capacities, mostly inflationary effects are anticipated from the domestic economic developments. Taking into account the inflationary effects expected from the external sector and domestic economy of Armenia, the CBA Board finds it appropriate to increase the policy rate. At the same time, committed to neutralizing the risks of accelerating inflationary expectations in the face of increasing domestic demand, the Board considers the necessity of possible tightening of monetary conditions in the near future. Under such conditions, the 12-month inflation is projected to remain high in the short term but will then gradually decrease and stabilize around the 4% target in the forecast horizon. The CBA Board reckons that, amid persisting uncertainties over the economic outlook, the risks to inflation deviating from the projected mid-term path are balanced, and should they materialize, the CBA stands ready to respond accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective. You can read detailed information on determining the level of interest rate in Inflation Report to be published by June 29, 2021 (MP Program for Q2, 2021).

Brazil,2021-06-16,"In its 239th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate to 4.25% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Regarding the global outlook, fiscal and monetary stimuli in some developed countries promote a robust economic recovery. Due to economic slack, central bank communication from major economies suggests monetary stimuli will last long. However, uncertainty remains high and a new round of market discussion regarding inflationary risks in these economies could result in a challenging environment for emerging economies. Turning to the Brazilian economy, despite the intensity of the second wave of the pandemic, recent indicators continue to evolve better than expected, implying relevant revisions in growth forecasts. Risks to economic recovery were significantly reduced. The persistence of inflationary pressure was more intense than expected, especially in industrial goods. Additionally, the slow pace of supply normalization, the resilience of demand and implications of the energy scenario deterioration over electricity fares contribute to keeping inflation under pressure in the short run, in spite of the Real appreciation. The Committee continues to closely monitor the evolution of shocks and their possible second-round effects, as well as the behavior of service prices as the immunization effects over the economy become more relevant. The various measures of underlying inflation are above the range compatible with meeting the inflation target. Inflation expectations for 2021, 2022, and 2023 collected by the Focus survey are around 5.8%, 3.8%, and 3.25%, respectively; and. The Copom's inflation projections in its baseline scenario, with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and exchange rate starting at USD/BRL 5.05* and evolving according to the purchase power parity (PPP), stand around 5.8% for 2021 and 3.5% for 2022. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2021 at 6.25% p.a. and rises to 6.50% p.a. in 2022. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 9.7% for 2021 and 5.1% for 2022. The energy flag is assumed to be neutral, remaining at ""red level 1"" in December each year. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, a possible reversion, even if partial, of the recent increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency would produce a lower-than-projected inflation in the baseline scenario. On the other hand, further extensions of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that increase aggregate demand and deteriorate the fiscal path may pressure the country's risk premium. In spite of the improvement of debt sustainability indicators, the elevated fiscal risk creates an upward asymmetry in the balance of risks, i.e., in the direction of higher-than-expected paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The Committee reiterates that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 0.75 p.p. to 4.25% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2022. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment. At this moment, the Copom's baseline scenario indicates, as appropriate, a normalization of the policy rate to a level considered neutral. This adjustment is necessary to mitigate the dissemination of the temporary shocks to inflation. However, the Committee again emphasizes that there is no commitment with this plan, and that future steps of monetary policy could be adjusted to assure the achievement of the inflation target. For the next meeting, the Committee foresees the continuation of the monetary normalization process with another adjustment of the same magnitude. However, a deterioration of inflation expectations for the relevant horizon may require a quicker reduction of the monetary stimulus. The Copom emphasizes that its view will also depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and how these factors affect inflation projections. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fabio Kanczuk. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
United States,2021-06-16,"EDT June 16, 2021 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. Progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remain. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT June 16, 2021assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C. Williams. Vice Chair; Thomas I Barkin; Raphael W Bostic; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H Clarida; Mary C Daly; Charles L Evans; Randal K. Quarles; and Christopher J Waller."
Egypt,2021-06-17,"Press Release June 17th, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 825 percent, 925 percent, and 875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 875 percen. Annual headline urban inflation increased to 48 percent in May 2021 from 41 percent in April 2021, after having decelerated from 45 percent in March 202. Annual headline inflation rates were affected by favorable and then unfavorable base effects during April and May 2021, reflecting the early impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 and its related containment measures on inflation readings during 202. Inflation readings are expected to continue to be affected by unfavorable base effects in the near ter. The acceleration in May 2021 was further driven by the higher annual contribution of volatile food item. The latter largely led annual food inflation to register 17 percent in May 2021 from negative 03 percent in April 202. Meanwhile annual nonfood inflation increased slightly for the second consecutive month to 63 percent in May 2021 from 61 percent in April 202. Furthermore annual core inflation inched up slightly to 34 percent in May 2021 from 33 percent in April 2021 after having decelerated from 37 percent in March 202. Real GDP growth recorded a preliminary figure of 29 percent during 2021 Q1, up from 20 percent during the previous quarte. Detailed data up to 2020 Q4 show that growth continues to be supported by a robust positive consumption contribution and in particular, private consumptio. Moreover the unfavorable contributions of gross domestic investments and net exports continue to subsid. Sectoral GDP growth was supported by the positive contributions of trade, construction and communication, while tourism and non-petroleum manufacturing continue to weigh down on growth despite their recent pick-u. Additionally real GDP growth is expected to remain on an accelerating trajectory, which is partially base effect driven from last year's shrunken bas. Furthermore leading indicators point towards a sustained momentum of recovery across the boar. Meanwhile the unemployment rate stabilized at 74 percent during 2021 Q1 compared to 72 percent during the previous quarte. Global economic activity continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, although growth remains uneven across regions, as some countries are yet to contain the spread of the viru. Prospects for global economic recovery remain contingent on the scale of distribution, as well as the efficacy of vaccine. Global financial conditions are expected to remain accommodative and supportive of economic activity over the medium ter. Meanwhile international prices for oil, food and other commodities have risen, maintaining the prevailing level of uncertainty regarding their future price trajectorie. The rises in international oil and other commodity prices were driven by both demand and supply side factor. Against this background, the MPC decided that keeping policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 7 percent (Â±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandat.

Turkiye,2021-06-17,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 19 percent. The worldwide speeding up of vaccination rollout, especially in developed countries, supports the global economic recovery. Nonetheless, the increasing trend of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and the rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of the rising global inflation and inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant. Domestic economic activity is strong. While domestic demand has slightly decelerated in the second quarter due to pandemic restrictions and the tightening in financial conditions, external demand remains strong. The acceleration of domestic vaccination rollout facilitates the recovery in services and tourism sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. Loan growth exhibits a mild course owing to the implemented monetary tightening. The course and composition of loans are monitored for macroeconomic stability. Despite the rise in commodity prices, the strong upward trend in exports, the slowdown in credit growth, the significant fall in gold imports and the strong progress in the vaccination program stimulating tourism activities are expected to accelerate the ongoing improvement in the current account balance. In addition to the recent import-price-based cost factors, demand conditions, supply constraints in some sectors, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand has begun to be observed. Taking into account the high levels of inflation and inflation expectations, the current tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively until the significant fall in the April Inflation Report's forecast path is achieved. Accordingly, the MPC has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The policy rate will continue to be determined at a level above inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is reached. The stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and perpetual decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2021-06-17,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 7.5% per annum. At the same time, the regulator is gradually phasing out the use of its anti-crisis monetary tools, which will enhance the effect of previous key policy rate hikes and contribute to lower inflation. In May, inflation accelerated more than forecast by the NBU. This was driven mainly by an increase in prices for some highly volatile consumer basket components, which was caused by short-term factors. Consumer inflation reached 9.5% yoy in May. The accelerated price growth was mostly related to trends in global commodity markets, particularly the rise in natural gas and sunflower oil prices. The last year's low comparison base also played an important role. Core inflation also increased in May, to 6.9% yoy, mostly on the back of higher prices for sunflower oil and oil-based foods. However, currently no signs of an increase in underlying inflationary pressures above the forecast are observed. Although remaining high, inflation expectations of businesses and households have stabilized over past months. The NBU expects inflation to slow in autumn thanks to the gradual waning of the low comparison base effect, better harvests, and the stabilizing impact of monetary policy. Inflationary pressures will remain high in the coming months, mainly due to temporary drivers  particularly supply-side factors and the last year's low comparison base. However, inflation will start to decelerate already in Q4 2021 and will return to the 5% target in H1 2022. This will be facilitated by the normalization of global commodity prices and the new, larger harvest coming to the market. The NBU's more restrained monetary policy should curb inflation expectations and ease the underlying inflationary pressure over the horizon of 918 months, including through the exchange rate channel. As before, the primary assumption of the NBU Board is that Ukraine will continue to cooperate with the IMF. IMF loans are an important source for financing the state budget deficit and a positive signal for foreign investors. Cooperation with the IMF and other international partners will facilitate a rapid recovery of the Ukrainian economy from the coronavirus crisis. As before, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic remains the key risk. On the one hand, new virus strains and the slow pace of the vaccination campaign pose risks of stricter quarantine restrictions, weaker business activity, and lower consumer and investment demand. On the other hand, the fading away of the pandemic could fuel pent-up consumer demand and speed up the revival of business activity, accelerating consumer price growth. There are other significant risks. volatility on the global capital markets, resulting, among other things, from a marked spike in global inflation and potential rises in risk premiumsa sharp deterioration in the terms of trade andan escalation of the military conflict.Taking into account the balance of risks, the NBU Board has decided to keep the key policy rate at 7.5%. At the same time, the Board has decided to phase out the use of anti-crisis monetary instruments, such as long-term refinancing and interest rate swaps. These instruments supported the banking system and the Ukrainian economy during the crisis. However, with economic activity recovering, they become irrelevant. The phasing out of these instruments will provide the NBU with more control over inflation processes. The NBU is ready to raise its key policy rate further if stronger underlying inflationary pressures and worsening expectations pose a threat to meeting the 5% inflation target in 2022. The next key policy rate decision will take into account the revised macroeconomic forecast, which will be published in July. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 7.5% was approved by NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No. 225, dated 17 June 2021. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 29 June 2021. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 22 July 2021, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
Hungary,2021-06-22,"At its meeting on 22 June 2021, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 23 June 2021:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability under the Bank's extended mandate effective from 2 August 2021. In the last months, a growing number of countries have begun to reopen their economies, the pace of which has been strongly influenced by developments in the pandemic and the population's vaccination level. World trade and global industrial production have already exceeded pre-crisis levels and there has been an improvement in the outlook for services activity. Incoming GDP data for the first quarter of 2021 significantly exceeded earlier expectations across a number of countries and regions. Risk appetite has still been driven primarily by the events related to the coronavirus pandemic, global supply problems and reflation concerns. Commodity prices have risen sharply since the beginning of the year. Global oil prices have surged above USD 70. The Federal Reserve's decision-makers left loose monetary conditions unchanged at their policy meeting in June and reiterated that the asset purchase programmes would be continued at an unchanged pace. In the decision-makers' view, the rise in inflation has been mainly due to temporary factors, but inflation expectations have also risen in the recent period. The European Central Bank has maintained the amount, raised in the second quarter, of purchases made under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) in the third quarter. However, in the region a number of central banks have indicated recently that they would stand ready to tighten monetary conditions, when necessary due to the increase in the outlook for inflation. The Polish central bank has left its policy rate unchanged since the MNB's previous interest rate decision. Hungarian economic growth continued in the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Hungary's GDP grew by 2.0 percent in the first quarter of 2021 relative to the previous quarter, but it was 2.1 percent below the level of a year earlier. Incoming data substantially exceeded expectations. Wage growth remained dynamic despite the pandemic; and the unemployment rate remained low by international standards. The vaccination coverage rate of Hungary's population is at the top in the European Union, which provided a good foundation for restarting economic life. As a result of the earlier opening than the European average, the economic recovery is expected to pick up significantly in the second quarter. Real-time data point to double-digit economic growth in the second quarter. Hungarian economic output is expected to recover to pre-Covid levels in the third quarter. The rapid recovery of industry is followed by retail trade, while the recovery of the service sector, which is most exposed to the pandemic, will take longer. The historically high investment rate is expected to continue rising on the forecast horizon. Hungarian export performance is expected to improve markedly already in 2021 as external markets recover. Driven by the gradual increase in the output of new export capacities built up in previous years, domestic exports are expected to remain an important source of GDP growth over the entire forecast horizon. Household demand is likely to pick up as restrictions are lifted gradually. The MNB has revised up its growth projection, according to which the Hungarian economy grows by 6.2 percent this year, by 5.5 percent in 2022 and by 3.5 percent in 2023. In May 2021, annual inflation was 5.1 percent, while core inflation stood at 3.4 percent. The consumer price index was unchanged and core inflation rose by 0.3 percentage points relative to the previous month. Inflation was consistent with the MNB's expectation; however, its structure confirmed that upside risks related to the reopening had appeared. The rapid recovery in demand will provide an opportunity to pass on higher raw material costs to consumer prices since the beginning of the year. Since April, the pace of increase in the prices of services and industrial goods has accelerated. At the same time, underlying measures of inflation also increased. Inflation is likely to stay mostly above the central bank's tolerance band until end of the year. After the spike in the second quarter, the consumer price index is expected to fall close to 4 percent at a slower-than-expected pace during the summer months before rising slightly again at the end of the year. Annual average inflation is expected to be 4.1 percent in 2021, higher than in the March projection. Due to base effects, inflation is expected to fall back into the central bank's tolerance band again at the beginning of 2022 and to stabilise around the central bank target from mid-2022 as a result of monetary policy measures. In the Monetary Council's assessment, it is of key importance to ensure that inflation expectations are properly anchored. Upside risks to the outlook for inflation have generally increased. Inflation in the euro area and the US has risen since the beginning of the year. Sustained rises in commodity prices and international freight costs point to a higher external inflation environment. Demand-supply frictions, re-emerging temporarily due to the rapid restart of the domestic economy, renewed tightening of labour market capacities expected in certain sectors combined with dynamic wage growth have increased inflation risks. Global reflation and persistent rises in commodity prices as well as potential second-round effects arising during the restart of the economy pose the greatest risks to the outlook for inflation. Following 8.1 percent in 2020, from 2021 the government deficit is expected to decline and, in parallel, the debt-to-GDP ratio to shift to a downward path. The current account surplus and the economy's net lending are expected to continue rising on the forecast horizon. The decline in the country's net external debt will continue. In the Monetary Council' assessment, in order to ensure price stability, to prevent the lasting effects of inflation risks and to anchor inflation expectations, it is warranted to launch a cycle of interest rate hikes. Accordingly, the Monetary Council increased the central bank base rate by 30 basis points to 0.9 percent. It kept the overnight deposit rate at -0.05 percent and the overnight and one-week collateralised lending rates at 1.85 percent unchanged. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at weekly tenders. According to the Monetary Council's assessment, it is warranted to increase the interest rate on the one-week deposit instrument to the 0.9 percent level of the base rate. As in previous quarters, the MNB will hold foreign exchange swap tenders providing euro liquidity at the end of June. Through an active market presence, the MNB cushions the spillover of end-of-quarter tensions in international swap markets to the domestic market, thereby contributing to preserving the stability of monetary conditions and through this to maintaining price stability. In parallel with the tightening of interest rate conditions, the Monetary Council has started to transform the use of instruments having an effect at longer maturities. The pick-up in economic recovery has made it possible for the Bank to phase out certain crisis management tools. Accordingly, with the exhaustion of the HUF 3,000 billion available, the Bank has closed the FGS Go!. However, the MNB intends to introduce instruments supporting environmental sustainability. The Monetary Council will provide information on those instruments in the coming months. The Monetary Council continues to consider the government securities purchase programme to be crucial in its set of monetary policy instruments, which it judges to be successful during the third wave of the pandemic and in a volatile international financial market environment. Purchases by the Bank have contributed to maintaining a stable liquidity position in the government securities market and improved the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. The MNB will continue to use the programme by maintaining a lasting presence in the market, taking a flexible approach to changing the quantity and structure of weekly securities purchases, to the extent and for the time necessary. The Monetary Council is committed to maintaining price stability. The Council has launched a cycle of interest rate hikes to ensure price stability, to prevent inflation risks from having long-lasting effects and to anchor inflation expectations. In the Monetary Council's assessment, risks to the inflation outlook remain on the upside. In the context of the outlook for inflation and developments in risks, the Monetary Council assesses the need to further tighten monetary conditions in a data-driven manner at its monthly policy meetings. The Monetary Council will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes until the outlook for inflation stabilises around the central bank target and inflation risks become evenly balanced on the horizon of monetary policy."
Czech Republic,2021-06-23,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank increased the two-week repo rate by 25 basis points to 0.50%. At the same time, it increased the Lombard rate to 1.25% and kept the discount rate unchanged at 0.05%. Four members voted in favour of this decision, one member voted for increasing the two-week repo rate by 50 basis points and two members voted for leaving rates unchanged.. This decision of the Bank Board is underpinned by the spring macroeconomic forecast and by an assessment of information obtained since it was prepared. Consistent with the forecast is a rise in market interest rates from roughly the middle of this year onwards. The Bank Board assessed the risks and uncertainties of the forecast as being slightly inflationary overall. The current outlook for GDP growth in the effective euro area has increased, especially for this year. This is due to the earlier easing of the anti-pandemic measures in the euro area countries than assumed by the current forecast. The outlook for foreign industrial producer prices  especially for this year  has moved upwards significantly. This is due in roughly equal measure to the core and energy components of producer prices. The increase in the energy component is being driven mainly by the continued rise in oil prices. The outlook for growth in the core component of producer prices has been revised upwards due to the overloading of global production and supply chains abating later. The outlooks for consumer price inflation in the effective euro area and foreign interest rates have been revised marginally upwards. The Brent crude oil price exceeded USD 70 a barrel in June and its outlook shifted appreciably above the assumptions of the current forecast. The expected euro-dollar exchange rate is virtually unchanged compared with the forecast. In line with the spring forecast, domestic inflation has been close to the upper boundary of the tolerance band in Q2 so far. As expected, core inflation remained elevated in April and slowed slightly in May. Consumer price inflation in this segment continued to be driven by a still solid income situation of households accompanied by strong inflation pressures from abroad. Growth in food prices remained highly volatile. Fuel prices switched to strong growth in Q2, mainly on account of base effects caused by the drop in oil prices during the first wave of the pandemic. According to the spring forecast, inflation will fluctuate around the upper boundary of the tolerance band in the quarters ahead and return close to the CNB's 2% target next year. This will be aided by an unwinding of the currently elevated growth in import prices and an expected tightening of monetary conditions. In Q1, the Czech economy faced the most stringent anti-epidemic measures so far. Despite this. GDP fell only slightly in quarter-on-quarter terms and its year-on-year decline was less pronounced than the spring forecast had expected. This was due mainly to a larger-than-forecasted contribution of gross capital formation and, within it, unexpectedly strong additions to inventories in particular. This was counteracted by a surprisingly negative contribution of net exports. A slight year-on-year increase in government consumption and a sharp year-on-year decline in household consumption were broadly as predicted. The spring forecast assumes that the economy started to recover in Q2. The Czech economy will thus return to growth overall this year, but the year-on-year dynamics of GDP will be highly volatile over the course of the year. Economic growth will pick up appreciably next year. Following a recovery in March, year-on-year growth in industrial production accelerated sharply in April, aided significantly by base effects. By contrast, construction remains in a downturn. In early spring, retail was still restricted by the anti-epidemic measures. As in the case of industry, the faster growth in retail sales in April was due largely to last year's low base. Despite the worst pandemic wave so far, the labour market situation did not deteriorate further in Q1. The slight increase in the general unemployment rate was in line with the forecast, and the share of unemployed persons in April and May was slightly lower than forecasted. Wage growth in market sectors was above the spring forecast owing to faster growth in the fundamental component of wages. By contrast, wage growth in non-market sectors lagged significantly behind the forecast. As a result, the expected overall wage growth broadly materialised. The koruna appreciated swiftly to CZK 25.4 to the euro in the first half of May. This was fostered by an inflow of foreign short-term capital into koruna assets, primarily reflecting a marked improvement in the epidemic situation at home and in most EU countries. The koruna has thus so far been slightly stronger in Q2 compared with the spring forecast. According to the forecast, the koruna will continue to firm gradually. The spring forecast was drawn up in an environment of elevated risks and uncertainties but has been materialising relatively well so far. The significantly smaller-than-expected year-on-year decline in economic activity in 2021 Q1 is good news. Inflation and average wage growth were in line with the forecast in May. The share of unemployed persons was slightly below the forecast in April and May."
Georgia,2021-06-23,"23.06.21 The National Bank of Georgia leaves the monetary policy rate unchanged at 9.5 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on June 23, 2021, and decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged at 9.5 percent. It should be noted that the inflationary tendencies seem to have intensified globally, however this is considered to be only a temporary phenomenon. In Georgia annual inflation stood at 7.7 percent in May. The contribution from imported and food prices to the inflation rate is still high due to rising prices on international agricultural markets and the exchange rate depreciation in previous periods. At the same time, rising global oil prices are pushing fuel prices higher and, consequently, increasing their contribution to the inflation. In addition, amid rising natural gas tariffs in Tbilisi, the impact of utility fees on the inflation rate is expected to increase further starting from June. It is also noteworthy that the base effect of the previous utility fees' subsidy will temporarily increase the annual inflation in December 2021 and January-February 2022. As for the aggregate demand side, preliminary data indicates its significant recovery, which is stronger than previously forecasted. In particular, economic activity in the first four months of the year increased by 8.1 percent annually and exceeded the 2019 level. At the same time, the growth rate of lending to the economy accelerated and the fiscal stimulus continues as well. Moreover, the growth of imports also points to the recovery of domestic demand. Countering the abovementioned factors, external inflows have increased, contributing to the positive dynamics on the foreign exchange market and, consequently, supporting the reduction of inflation. Annual inflation is expected to peak in June, while in 2021, other things being equal, it will average 7 percent. According to the current forecasts, maintaining tight monetary policy for a prolonged period and the expected fade-out of one-off exogenous factors that are independent from the monetary policy will support the gradual return of inflation to the target in 2022. Taking into account these factors, the Committee decided to leave the monetary policy rate unchanged. As mentioned above, there are signs of recovery in foreign demand, however, on aggregate  taking into account the tourism sector - it remains below the pre-pandemic levels. According to the preliminary data, exports of goods increased by 45 percent year-on-year in May and is slightly lower compared to May 2019. Revenues from international travelers increased 8-fold year-on-year in May, however compared to the same period in 2019 the drop is 73 percent. Moreover, it should be noted that, in the context of high monetary policy rate, non-residents' interest in government securities has increased, which is an additional source of foreign exchange inflows. As for the imports of goods, against the backdrop of strong domestic demand, an annual growth of 40 percent was recorded in May, which is about 6 percent lower relative to May 2019. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on August 4, 2021."
Mongolia,2021-06-23,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged and setting the refinancing amount No: 2021/02 Date: June 23, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia held a scheduled meeting on June 23, 2021. With due consideration to the current state of the economy and financial markets, as well as to future outlook and risks inherent in domestic and foreign environments, the MPC decided to: 1. Keep the policy rate unchanged at 6 percent; 2. Provide up to MNT 250 billion under the Bank of Mongolia's long-term repo financing instrument in the third quarter of 2021. Annual headline inflation stands at 6.2 percent nationwide and 6.7 percent in Ulaanbaatar city as of May 2021. Whilst the economic recovery is contributing to some extent, the inflation is mainly driven by base effects and temporary supply-related factors. As a result of latter, the headline inflation is expected to temporarily increase, however, it will stabilize around the central bank's target level in 2022. Global economic activity has intensified, demand for commodities has increased, and thus, our export prices have remained high since the beginning of the year. As the external environment has improved and the most sectors of the economy have shifted to recovery, the economic growth in the first quarter of 2021 is stronger than earlier expected. An upgrade of growth outlook in 2021 is supported by both favorable external environment and the policy measures taken by the government and the central bank aiming at economic recovery. However, recovery remains dissimilar among economic sectors and their outlook is uneven, and the uncertainty has not reduced with respect to the domestic spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The step-by-step implementation of monetary and macro-prudential policy measures and the adoption of new financing instruments and relaxed financial regulatory requirements by the central bank directed at mitigating the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic contribute to facilitating economic recovery and ensuring banking sector stability. The current monetary policy stance is in line with the inflation target of the central bank. The policy adjustments aiming to maintain inflation under its target range shall be taken place inconsistent with the economic recovery and outlook. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Philippines,2021-06-23,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility at 2.0 percent. The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were likewise kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. Latest inflation forecasts indicate that the average inflation is likely to settle near the upper end of the target range of 2-4 percent in 2021; the BSP expects that average inflation will ease towards the midpoint of the target range in 2022 and 2023. Price pressures on food commodities have abated with favorable weather conditions and the facilitation of meat imports to augment domestic supply. The Monetary Board emphasizes that the continued implementation of direct non-monetary measures will be crucial in mitigating further supply-side pressures on meat prices and inflation. At the same time, the risks to the inflation outlook remain broadly balanced around the baseline projection path. The uptick in international commodity prices amid supply-chain bottlenecks and the recovery in global demand could lend upside pressures on inflation. However, downside risks to the inflation outlook continue to emanate from the emergence of new coronavirus variants, which could delay the easing of containment measures and temper prospects for domestic growth. The Monetary Board also observed that economic activity has improved in recent weeks, but the overall momentum of the economic recovery remains tentative as the threat of COVID-19 infections continues. Nevertheless, the sustained implementation of targeted fiscal initiatives as well as the acceleration of the Government's vaccination program should help boost market confidence and recovery of the economy in the coming months. On balance, the expected path of inflation and downside risks to domestic economic growth warrant keeping monetary policy settings unchanged. The Monetary Board believes that sustained monetary policy support for domestic demand should help the economic recovery gain more traction, especially as risk aversion continues to temper credit activity despite ample liquidity in the financial system. Looking ahead, the BSP affirms its support to the economy for as long as necessary to ensure its strong and sustainable recovery. The BSP will also remain vigilant against any emerging risks to the outlook for inflation and growth and will adjust its policy settings as needed to safeguard its price and financial stability objectives."
Thailand,2021-06-23,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 4/2021 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 23 June 2021 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent. The Committee assessed that the Thai economic recovery would be slower and more uneven than the previous forecast due to the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Downside risks to the economic outlook also remained significant from the new wave of the outbreak. The Committee viewed that financial measures, particularly special loan facility for businesses as well as debt restructuring, should be expedited. These measures would reduce financial burden for the businesses and households affected by the outbreak in a more targeted manner than cutting the policy rate, which was already at a low level. The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting and stand ready to use the limited policy space at the most effective timing. The Thai economy was projected to expand by 18 and 39 percent in 2021 and 2022 respectively. This would be lower than the previous projection owing to lower foreign tourist figures and domestic demand held down by the third wave of the outbreak. The labor market would be more fragile and recover slowly, particularly the service sectors and the self-employed. However the economy would be supported by higher public expenditure thanks to the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Additional Loans to Solve Economic and Social Problems as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic. BE. 2564 (2021) as well as by the improving merchandise exports in line with the global economic recovery. Headline inflation would temporarily increase in the second quarter of 2021 due to the low level of crude oil prices in the same quarter of last year. Meanwhile higher inflation in advanced economies and global supply shortages would have limited impact on domestic inflation. Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target. Downside risks to the economic outlook also remained significant from the possibility of the outbreak situation in Thailand and abroad becoming more severe owing to virus mutations. The Committee would closely monitor these risks which would affect foreign tourist figures as well as domestic economic activities. Despite ample overall liquidity, the distribution of liquidity remained uneven due to increased credit risks, particularly among SMEs and households that were additionally impacted by the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Long-term government bond yields remained stable. On exchange rates, the Thai baht relative to the US dollar depreciated more than regional currencies. The Committee would closely monitor developments in both the global and domestic financial markets and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem. The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery impacted by the new outbreak. Short-term measures to accelerate the procurement and distribution of vaccines would prevent the outbreak from being prolonged. Fiscal measures would play a crucial role in driving the economic recovery amid high uncertainties. Thus the government should accelerate the disbursement of relief and other fiscal support measures to provide adequate and continuous economic stimulus as well as address vulnerabilities in the labor market. Meanwhile monetary policy must remain accommodative. The new financial rehabilitation measures to support business recovery post-COVID-19 and other measures by specialized financial institutions (SFIs) should accelerate the distribution of liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner, reduce debt burden, and support the economic recovery. In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring. The Bank of Thailand would closely monitor the progress and assess the efficacy of financial and credit measures. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery. In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook, namely the distribution and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, the possibility of the outbreak situation in Thailand and abroad becoming more severe owing to virus mutations, as well as the adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures. The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary."
Mexico,2021-06-24,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided to increase the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.25%, effective June 25, 2021. The recovery of global economic activity continued during the second quarter, with heterogeneity across countries as a result of vaccine availability and stimulus spending. Global inflation continued increasing due to pressures on various commodity prices, base effects, and other cost-related pressures associated with bottlenecks in production. The fact that in the United States annual CPI inflation reached 5% in May, the highest figure since September 2008, is noteworthy. The central banks of advanced economies left their monetary stimuli unchanged, although it is foreseen that these could be maintained for a shorter period. After a period of stability, financial markets registered some volatility. At a global level, risks associated with the pandemic and with higher levels of inflation hastening the withdrawal of monetary stimuli, persist. Since the last monetary policy decision, the Mexican peso depreciated, shorter-term interest rates increased, while longer-term rates decreased. The Mexican economy recovered notably in March and moderately in April. It is expected to resume its recovery during the rest of the year, with an equilibrated balance of risks and slack conditions for the economy as a whole, with significant differences across sectors. The supply chains and productive processes of several goods and services continue to be affected by the pandemic. This has caused shocks beyond those foreseen on headline and core inflation, which reached 6.02% and 4.58%, respectively, during the first fortnight of June. Headline and core inflation expectations for 2021 increased once again and those for the medium and long terms remained relatively stable at levels above the 3% target. After incorporating the recent behavior of inflation, the revised forecasts for headline and core inflation for the next quarters are above those published in the last Quarterly Report. Thus, headline inflation is now expected to converge to the 3% target during the third quarter of 2022. These forecasts are subject to risks. On the upside: external inflationary pressures; cost-related pressures or reallocation of spending; core inflation persistence; exchange rate depreciation; and that the drought exerts pressure on agricultural and livestock product prices. On the downside: effects stemming from the negative output gap; greater social distancing measures; and exchange rate appreciation. The balance of risks that might affect updating the anticipated path for inflation within the forecast horizon is biased to the upside. Although the shocks that have affected inflation are expected to be of a transitory nature, given their variety, magnitude, and the extended time frame in which they have been affecting inflation, they may pose a risk to the price formation process. In this context, it was deemed necessary to strengthen the 1 monetary policy stance in order to avoid adverse effects on inflation expectations, attain an orderly adjustment of relative prices, and enable the convergence of inflation to the 3% target. With the presence of all its members, the Governing Board decided by majority to increase the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.25%. Two members voted for leaving the target unchanged at 4.00%. Looking ahead, monetary policy implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on inflation, on its foreseen trajectories within the forecast horizon, and on its expectations. The Governing Board will take the necessary actions based on incoming information in order for the policy rate to be consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. It is necessary to safeguard the institutional framework, strengthen the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopt the necessary actions on both monetary and fiscal policy fronts, to enable a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole."
Colombia,2021-06-28,"Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). The decision was based on the following considerations. Banco de la Republica's board of directors (BDBR) in its meeting on June 28 voted unanimously to hold the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%. The decision was based on the following considerations. Colombia's economy grew more than expected in the first quarter of 2021 and, according to the monthly economic tracking indicator (ISE), appears to have maintained its dynamism through April. However, a third wave of COVID-19 and, in particular, roadblocks and other disruptions to public order will likely be reflected in reduced economic activity in the second quarter. Despite this, the positive economic performance through April justified an upward revision in growth projections for 2021, from 6% to 6.5% in the central forecast scenario. Even in this case, however, economic activity would remain below 2019 levels this year. Persistent high levels of unemployment and economic informality were additional considerations. Annual inflation in May exceeded projections at 3.3%. Upward pressures from food prices (9.52%), and in particular from perishable foods (18.16%), came as the result of supply difficulties in several cities. Core inflation excluding foods and regulated items (1.56%) remained below the target and was similar to projections. A portion of the recent increase in inflation could prove to be somewhat persistent and affect inflation expectations, which remain anchored. Despite growth in foreign demand and improved terms of trade, the current account deficit is expected to expand in line with increased dynamism in domestic demand. Inflation in the United States was unexpectedly high and is expected to remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. This has raised the possibility of a faster start to normalization in U.S. monetary policy than previously expected, which could lead to a return to less favorable international financial conditions and affect risk appetite for investments in emerging markets. Given Colombia's current fiscal situation and levels of public debt, a failure to enact the fiscal adjustment required for the public finances could compromise access to financing and increase financing costs, which would eventually reduce the space for monetary policy to continue supporting recovery in economic activity and employment. In considering these circumstances and the general balance of risks, the BDBR decided unanimously to hold the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%. Monetary policy decisions will continue to depend on new information related to the evolution of the risks mentioned above.

Israel,2021-07-05,"The rapid recovery of economic activity continues. The economy is almost completely open, and as of now, there are not material restrictions on economic activity. However, since mid-June, we have been witnessing an increase in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, as a result of the spread of the 'Delta Variant'. At this stage, the morbidity level is low, but the spread of the disease poses some risk to the continued recovery of the economy. The broad unemployment rate declined to 9.5 percent, and the employment rate excluding COVID-19 absentees increased slightly. However, job vacancies as a share of total positions has stabilized at a high level. The Research Department's assessment is that GDP will grow by 5.5 percent in 2021, and by 6 percent in 2022, such that the level of GDP at the end of 2022 is expected to be only about 0.5 percent lower than the level that was expected prior to the crisis. Home prices increased rapidly, by 5.6 percent in the past 12 months. However, the pace of rental price increases remains moderate. The upward trend in the pace of inflation continues. Inflation in the past 12 months has entered the target range, and is now 1.5 percent. Inflation expectations for the coming year continued to increase, and are within the target range. Inflation expectations for the medium and long terms declined slightly, but remained anchored at the midpoint of the target range. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel weakened by 1.1 percent against the US dollar, and strengthened by 0.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rateand by 2.2 percent against the euro. The Monetary Committee has decided to end the program providing long-term loans to the banking system against loans to be provided to small and micro businesses on October 1, 2021 or upon the utilization of NIS 40 billion in the program. The return to normal life in Israel supports rapid growth in the coming year. However, there are still challenges to economic activity in view of the health risks in Israel and abroad and the impact to the economy, particularly the labor market. The Committee will therefore continue to conduct a very accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time, using a range of tools as necessary, including the interest rate tool, in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy targets and the recovery of the economy from the crisis, and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, click here. The economy is almost completely open, and other than a restriction on the entry of nonresidents to Israel and certain restrictions on Israelis traveling abroad, there are no material restrictions on economic activity as of now. As such, the rapid recovery of economic activity continues. However, from mid-June, we have seen an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients as a result of the spread of the 'Delta Variant'. At this stage, the morbidity level is low, but the spread of the disease poses some risk to the continued recovery of the economy, mainly to businesses that rely on foreign tourists. The available indicators regarding economic activity show a continuation of the recovery that began with the exit from the third lockdown, but the levels of activity, and particularly of employment, remain lower than their levels prior to the crisis. Since April, credit card expenditures have been in line with the long-term trend. The trend of recovery in consumption is reflected in the industries that were significantly hard-hit by the restrictions (Figure 3). Themobility indices to work places declined slightly, while the mobility indices to stores, vacations, and retail outlets continue to increase. In addition, total industry revenue in April increased beyond the trend that was expected prior to the crisis (Figure 5). The upward trend in services exports continued in April, and its level is higher than what it was prior to the crisis, despite the fact that tourism exports remain low. Data on goods exports indicate a slight decline in May, but have remained stable over recent months, following volatility throughout the crisis (Figure 6). Goods imports increased in May, and are at a high level (Figure 7). Labor Force Survey data for the second half of June indicate a further slight decline in the broad unemployment rate, to 9.5 percent (Figure 9). The employment rate is in an upward trend, though at a more moderate pace than in previous months. Since the exit from the third lockdown, there has been an increase in the adjusted employment rate (according to which COVID-19 absentees are not considered employed), to 56.6 percent in May, while the rate was 61 percent in 2019, prior to the crisis. In the first half of June, there was a further small improvement in employment (Figure 11). The number of employed persons in May was about 300,000 below potential according to the trend forecast prior to the crisis. The gap from the forecast trend was the narrowest since the beginning of the crisis. The industries in which there is a reported lack of employees are the restaurants and tourism industries, which were particularly hard-hit by the crisis, and the construction industry, where the lack of workers may be due to a slowdown in demand for labor, which in turnis in line with the slowdown in the pace of building starts. The number of job vacancies continues to increase moderately, and the job vacancy rate as a share of positions has stabilized at a high level (Figure 12). The Bank of Israel Research Department revised its macroeconomic staff forecast for the coming two years. In its assessment. GDP will grow by 5.5 percent in 2021 (Figure 1). The broad unemployment rate is expected to decline to 8 percent of the labor force at the end of 2021. In 2022. GDP is expected to grow by 6 percent, so that the level of GDP at the end of 2022 is expected to be only about 0.5 percent lower than the level that was expected prior to the crisis. The unemployment rate is expected to continue declining in 2022, and to reach about 5.5 percent by the end of the year, still higher than the precrisis level. Assuming that the State budget passes as planned and that the fiscal consolidation will be pushed off to 2023 and thereafter, the debt to GDP ratio during these years is expected to be 74 percent. Home prices increased by 5.6 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 25), a rate that is more rapid than in previous years, with an increase in the number of home purchases and reflecting the moderating numbers of building starts and building completions. In addition, the prices of construction inputs increased. With that, thepace of rental price increases remained moderate. Mortgage volume was NIS 9.5 billion in May, further to the high mortgage volumes since the beginning of the year. (Figure 26). The upward trend in the pace of inflation continued. The CPI for May increased by 0.4 percent, and inflation in the past 12 months entered the target range, and is now 1.5 percent (1 percent net of energy, fruits and vegetables; Figure 16). The increase in tradable goods prices continued, in view of the increase in energy prices. The prices of nontradable components also increased, particularly those that have been impacted by the removal of restrictions, such as culture, recreation and leisure (Figure 17). Inflation in Israel excluding energy and food is drawing closer to the OECD median (Figure 18). In view of the rapid recovery of economic activity, the accommodative policies around the world, and the increase in the global inflation environment, one-year inflation expectations continued to increase, and are within the target range. In particular, expectations derived from the capital market and from inflation forecasters are at the midpoint of the target range (Figure 19). Inflation expectations for the medium and long terms declined slightly, but remained anchored at the midpoint of the target range (Figure 20). The Monetary Committee is closely monitoring these developments, and it estimates that there is no concern of an outbreak of high inflation. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel weakened by 1.1 percent against the US dollar, and strengthened by 0.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and by 2.2 percent against the euro (Figure 21). </p> In thecapital market, share prices and corporate bond spreads remained largely unchanged. Corporate bond spreads are similar to their precrisis levels (Figure 24). The yields on government bonds also remained stable. The credit market continues to function well with stable and low interest rates (Figures 29 and 30). According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, credit restraints returned to their precrisis levels in all industries except the hotels industry. An examination of the financing difficulty among large and medium businesses also indicates a return to precrisis levels. Among small businesses, there was a further improvement reported in May, with a decline in the level of difficulty in obtaining bank credit, which is drawing close to the 2019 level (Figure 28). To combat the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, the Bank of Israel implemented dedicated policy tools to support the proper functioning of the markets, strengthen the transmission of monetary policy, and increase the supply of credit to small and micro businesses. These measures included an outline for deferring loan repayments to the banking system for households and businesses, a reduction of capital requirements at the banks, a loan program to the banking system against credit to small businesses, bond purchases by the Bank of Israel, and more. With the removal of restrictions and the recovery of the economy, there is less need for the specific program to provide long-term loans to the banking system against loans to be issued to small and micro businesses, and the operation of this tool will be halted. The layer through which loans were provided to the banks at a -0.1 percent interest rate ended as planned in June, and the layer of loans at 0.1 percent interest will end on October 1 or once a total of NIS 40 billion has been utilized. The Bank of Israel is constantly examining the market conditions, and continuesto use the other special tools for the crisis as necessary. Globally, vaccinations in developed countries have reached a high rate, and morbidity is in a downward trend, which allowing the removal of restrictions on economic activity. Global growth forecasts for 2021 by the World Bank and the investment houses were revised upward (Figure 31) in view of the fiscal program approved in the US, the vaccination campaign, and the acclimation to economic activity under restrictions. The global Purchasing Managers' Index continues to increase, indicating economic expansion, and for the first time since the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis, the index for the services sector indicates a higher level than for the manufacturing sector. The volume of world trade continued to increase in recent months. Equity indices continue to increase, although the pace of price increases was relatively moderate. The pricing of some financial assets may not necessarily reflect all risks. There were increases in oil prices, while there were declines in the commodity indices during the recent period. ; The global inflation environment continues to increase, but long-term inflation expectations moderated (Figure 34). Monetary policy in the major economies remained very accommodative. The central banks left their interest rates unchanged and did not change their purchasing programs. However, in a small number of markets, mainly developing markets, where there are marked inflationary pressures, there were increases in the interest rates. The US is leading the global economic recovery, as a resultof the rapid inoculation, the removal of restrictions, and a broad fiscal program. In Europe as well, sentiment data indicate an acceleration of economic activity. However, in the UK, the continued opening of the economy was delayed in view of an increase in morbidity. The recovery in China continues, but its pace slowed. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on July 19, 2021. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. August 23, 2021. In thecapital market, share prices and corporate bond spreads remained largely unchanged."
Romania,2021-07-07,"In its meeting of 7 July 2021, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual inflation rate went up to 3.24 percent in April 2021 from 3.05 percent in March, whereas in May it rose to 3.75 percent (slightly above the forecast), exceeding the upper bound of the variation band of the target. The increase owed almost entirely to the exogenous CPI components, particularly the hike in fuels prices amid higher oil prices. In April 2021, the average annual CPI inflation rate remained flat at the 2.6 percent level reported in December 2020, going up to 2.8 percent in May. Calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual rate rose to 2.2 percent in April and to 2.3 percent in May from 2.1 percent in March. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate stayed below 3 percent, moving up in April and remaining at 2.9 percent in May versus 2.8 percent in March 2021. Economic activity continued to rebound in 2021 Q1 at a considerably faster pace than anticipated, albeit slower than in the previous quarter, thus recovering almost entirely the loss incurred in 2020 Q2. Specifically, the economy declined in annual terms at a slower pace of only -0.2 percent compared to -1.4 percent in 2020 Q4, given its 2.8 percent quarterly growth. In light of this evolution, a positive output gap is likely to re-open in 2021 Q1, two quarters earlier than in the latest medium-term forecast. Looking at annual developments, in 2021 Q1, the recovery was further driven by domestic demand. This time around, the major determinant was private consumption, which saw a notable rebound, mainly due to the strong revival in purchases of goods and services, but also on account of other sub-components. In turn, gross fixed capital formation had a larger positive contribution to annual GDP dynamics, which came therefore to prevail, given the significantly faster increase in this component amid the leap taken by the change in net investment in equipment (including transport equipment), outpacing the impact of the significant loss of momentum seen by new construction works. Conversely, the negative contribution of net exports recorded a significant pick-up, following a swifter growth rate of imports of goods and services than of exports thereof, entailing also a more pronounced widening of the trade deficit compared to the same period of the previous year. Against this backdrop, but also in the wake of the notable worsening of the primary and secondary income balances  on the back of flows of reinvested earnings and, to a small extent, of net inflows of EU funds , the current account deficit recorded the largest widening in annual terms in 14 quarters. According to the latest developments in high-frequency indicators, the economy continued to increase in 2021 Q2, at a slower quarterly pace, which  given the base effect associated with the severe contraction in the same year-ago period  implies nevertheless an increase to a significant two-digit level in the annual GDP dynamics. Mention should be made of the particularly large increases recorded in April 2021 against April 2020 by retail trade (motor vehicles and motorcycles sales included) and especially by market services to households. At the same time, in April, industrial output expanded considerably in annual terms, coming to exceed by 3 percent the pre-pandemic level, with manufacturing output standing 3.9 percent higher; new orders in manufacturing saw an even sharper rise, whereas the volume of construction works posted again a markedly faster growth in annual terms. Moreover, the year-on-year advance in trade deficit posted a mild slowdown, as the significant pick-up in exports outpaced that in imports of goods and services. The annual growth rate of current account deficit decelerated, however, much faster, due, inter alia, to the primary and secondary income balances; the dynamics remained nevertheless above the average values seen in 2019 and 2020. Looking at the financial market, relevant interbank money market rates witnessed further slight declines in May and June, while government security yields stuck to a slowly downward path at the shorter end of the maturity spectrum and posted moderate upward adjustments across longer maturities. Lending rates on the main types of new business to non-bank clients extended or steepened their downtrend April through May 2021, thus falling to very low values from a historical perspective. At the same time, after the mild increase in the first part of April, the EUR/RON exchange rate tended to stabilise at the new readings, inter alia amid the interest rate differential. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector stepped up considerably in the first two months of 2021 Q2, climbing to 10.1 percent in May, its average for the period overall advancing to 9.2 percent from 5.7 percent in Q1. These developments reflected both a base effect and the hefty contribution of the credit flow, amid the further solid economic growth and the generally downward trend in interest rates, to which added the government programmes, whose contribution rose slightly against the previous two months, although remaining modest. Hence, the leu-denominated component saw its annual dynamics pick up to 14.5 percent April through May, from 10.0 percent in Q1, its share in total private sector credit widening to 70.6 percent in May, a record high for the post-January 1996 period. The latest assessments indicate the outlook for the annual inflation rate to rise over the short time horizon to higher values than those in the latest medium-term forecast, published in the May 2021 Inflation Report, under the stronger transitory impact of supply-side factors. Determining factors are the larger hikes in energy prices, particularly of natural gas and electricity. At the same time, developments in the pandemic and in the associated restrictive measures continue to generate considerable uncertainties and risks to the inflation outlook, at least in the short run, amid the pace of vaccination slowing markedly on the domestic front and the more contagious (Delta) coronavirus variant tending to spread in some European countries. Sources of uncertainties and risks also remain the fiscal policy stance and the absorption of European funds, especially those under the Next Generation EU programme. Important from this perspective are the upcoming budget revision and the budget consolidation strategy presumed to be prepared by this autumn, in line with European institutions' recommendations, as well as the approval by the EC of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan. On the labour market, recent developments are more favourable than anticipated, also in terms of hiring intentions, but uncertainties linger about the prospects for the epidemiological situation and the implications of suspending government support schemes. Additional risks stem from the synchronised uptrends in many commodity prices, likely to accelerate inflation globally. In the meeting held today, 7 July 2021, based on the currently available data and assessments, and in light of the elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 1.25 percent per annum; moreover, it decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 0.75 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 1.75 percent per annum. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to preserve price stability over the medium term in line with the 2.5 percent Â±1 percentage point flat inflation target, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth in the context of fiscal consolidation, while safeguarding financial stability. The NBR is closely monitoring domestic and global developments and stands ready to use its available instruments in order to achieve the overriding objective regarding medium-term price stability. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 19 July 2021, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 6 August 2021, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Malaysia,2021-07-08,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 1.75 percent. The global economic recovery has strengthened further, supported by improvements in manufacturing and services activity. The pace of recovery, however, varies across countries. Economies making better progress in their vaccination programmes have been able to ease containment measures, enabling a swift recovery in domestic activity. In several advanced economies, sizeable fiscal and monetary measures are also supporting a stronger recovery momentum, although activities in some economies are disrupted by tighter containment measures to curb COVID-19 resurgences. Financial conditions remain supportive of growth. Overall, the balance of risks to the growth outlook remains tilted to the downside, due mainly to uncertainty over the path of the pandemic as well as potential risks of heightened financial market volatility. For the Malaysian economy, better-than-expected economic activity in the first quarter of 2021 continued into April, as reflected by latest indicators, particularly on exports, retail spending and labour market conditions. The re-imposition of nation-wide containment measures to curb the resurgence in COVID-19 cases, however, will dampen the growth momentum. The degree of impact to the economy is highly dependent on the stringency and duration of containment measures. Nevertheless, continued allowances for essential economic sectors to operate, albeit at a reduced capacity, and higher adaptability to remote work, automation and digitalisation will partly mitigate the impact of restrictions. The various policy support packages will alleviate some of the financial burdens of households and businesses. Favourable external demand conditions will continue to provide a lift to growth. Going forward, the gradual relaxation of containment measures, alongside the rapid progress of the domestic vaccination programme and continued strength in external demand will provide support for the growth recovery into 2022. The growth outlook, however, remains subject to significant downside risks, due mainly to factors that could lead to a delay in the easing of containment measures or imposition of tighter containment measures, and a weaker-than-expected global growth recovery. The materialisation of these risks could undermine the growth recovery. As expected, headline inflation spiked recently due mainly to the base effect from low fuel prices in the second quarter of last year. This spike is transitory and headline inflation is projected to moderate in the near term as this base effect dissipates. For 2021 as a whole, headline inflation is projected to average closer to the lower bound of the forecast range. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to remain subdued, averaging between 0.5% and 1.5% for the year, amid continued spare capacity in the economy. The outlook, however, is subject to global commodity price developments. The MPC considers the stance of monetary policy to be appropriate and accommodative. In addition, fiscal and financial measures will continue to cushion the economic impact on businesses and households and provide support to economic activity. Given the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the stance of monetary policy will continue to be determined by new data and information and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth. The Bank remains committed to utilise its policy levers as appropriate to foster enabling conditions for a sustainable economic recovery. Bank Negara Malaysia 08 July 2021."
Peru,2021-07-08,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT JULY 2021 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation increased from 2.45 percent in May to 3.25 percent in June being temporarily above the target range due to supply-side pressures. Trend inflation remains around the center of the target range. Year-on- year core inflation was 1.9 percent in June. Inflation is expected to return to the target range in the next twelve months and remain within that range in 2022, due to the reversal of the effects of transitory factors on the inflation rate (exchange rate, fuel and grain prices in international markets) and that economic activity will remain below its potential level. One-year-ahead expected inflation increased from 2.43 percent in May to 2.60 in June and hence the real reference rate kept doing down. Most leading indicators and expectations about the economy deteriorated in June. Global economic recovery is expected to be more pronounced in the next quarters, as the vaccination process continues around the world, and significant stimulus packages are implemented in developed countries. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain an expansionary stance as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist and is especially attentive to new information referring to inflation expectations and the evolution of economic activity. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows. Financial markets were highly volatile in a context of electoral uncertainty and the BCRP's actions were intended to mitigate this volatility. As of July 7. BCRP injection operations totaled S/ 62,758 million, of which S/ 47,654 million were associated with government-backed repos. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on August 12, 2021."
Poland,2021-07-08,"Warsaw, 8 July 2021 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 8 July 2021 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 0.10%; lombard rate at 0.50%; deposit rate at 0.00%; rediscount rate at 0.11%; discount rate at 0.12%. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. The timing and scale of the conducted measures will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. The recent period has seen a reduction in scope of pandemic around the world. However, the spread of new variants of virus has been driving up the uncertainty regarding the further course of the pandemic. The gradual easing of sanitary restrictions has led to an improvement in business conditions in the services sector in many economies. At the same time the activity in industry sector has continued to increase, alongside supply restrictions in certain markets. In the euro area 2021 Q2 brought a recovery in economic activity, after a fall in GDP in 2021 Q1. The prices of many commodities, in particular oil, has increased recently and are currently significantly higher than a year ago. Along with the supply-side disruptions related to the pandemic, this is exerting an upward pressure on global inflation, including in advanced economies. However, due to temporary nature of factors driving up inflation and uncertainty about the economic outlook, major central banks are keeping interest rates low, conducting asset purchases as well as signalling that loose monetary policy will be maintained in the future. In Poland, recent months have seen a significant recovery in economic activity. In May 2021, retail sales grew significantly, supported by realisation of previously postponed purchases. At the same time, business conditions in industry remained very favourable. The construction and assembly output increased in annual terms, but its level remained significantly lower then before pandemic. This was accompanied by an increase in average employment in the enterprise sector and stabilization in annual average wage growth in this sector. According to the Statistics Poland flash estimate, inflation in Poland decreased to 4.4% y/y in June 2021 (in monthly terms it amounted to 0.1%). At the same time core inflation excluding food and energy prices declined  according to the preliminary estimation  to the lowest level in over a year. The annual inflation rate continued to be pushed up by high fuel price growth  related to the significantly higher global oil prices than a year ago  as well as the increase in electricity prices at the beginning of 2021 and the increases in waste disposal charges, i.e. by the factors that are beyond the control of domestic monetary policy. The growing costs of running business amidst the pandemic, higher international transport charges and temporary disruptions in supply chains, also continue to add to inflation. The above-mentioned factors will probably translate into annual price growth staying above the upper band for deviations from the inflation target in the coming months. At the same time, next year  after the factors temporarily increasing price growth fade  inflation is expected to decrease. Price developments next year will depend on the robustness of economic recovery, including the situation in the labour market following phasing-out of the anti-crisis measures. Available forecasts indicate that the coming quarters will see a further recovery in economic activity, although its scale and pace are highly uncertain. The further course of the pandemic and its impact on economic situation in Poland and abroad continues to be the main source of uncertainty. The economic policy measures, including the easing of NBP's monetary policy introduced last year, and the expected recovery in the global economy will have a positive impact on the domestic economic situation. The pace of the economic recovery in Poland will also depend on further developments of the zloty exchange rate. The Council became acquainted with the results of the July projection of inflation and GDP based on the NECMOD model. In line with the projection prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 22 June 2021 there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of 3.84.4% in 2021 (against 2.73.6% in the March 2021 projection), 2.5-4.1% in 2022 (compared to 2.03.6%) and 2.44.3 in 2023 (compared to 2.24.2%). At the same time, the annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 4.15.8% in 2021 (against 2.65.3% in the March 2021 projection), 4.2-6.5% in 2022 (compared to 4.06.9%) and 4.16.5% in 2023 (compared to 4.06.8%). As indicated in Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2021, due to the macroeconomic and financial shocks, inflation may temporarily deviate from the target and even run outside the band for deviations from the target. The response of monetary policy to the shocks is flexible and depends on their causes and the assessment of persistence of their effects, including their impact on inflation developments. NBP's monetary policy supports the consolidation of economic recovery following the pandemic-induced recession and stabilises inflation at the level consistent with the NBP's inflation target in the medium term. Taking into account the sources and the expected temporary nature of inflation exceeding the NBP's target, as well as the uncertainty about the robustness and scale of the economic recovery. NBP is keeping interest rates unchanged. At the same time. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in the secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP's interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In order to strengthen the impact of the NBP's monetary policy easing on the economy. NBP may also intervene in the foreign exchange market. The timing and scale of the measures taken by NBP will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also continue to offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  July 2021."
Thailand,2021-07-12,"Outcome of the Joint Meeting between the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 7 July 2021 The Bank of Thailand (BOT) announced the outcome of the joint meeting between the MPC and the FIPC on 7 July 2021, to assess risks to Thailand's financial stability. Key discussion points were as follows. The committees concluded that Thailand's financial stability remained robust overall. Commercial banks, securities companies, mutual funds and insurance companies held substantial capital buffers, while financial markets continued to function properly. Results of macro stress tests conducted by financial regulators showed that commercial banks, securities companies, mutual funds, and insurance companies had sufficient liquidity and strong financial position to withstand shocks in a stress scenario. Nevertheless the latest wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, which became more severe due to viral mutations, made businesses and households significantly more vulnerable by slowing down the pace and worsening the unevenness of economic recovery. Moreover given previously high levels of household debt, low-income households would be especially fragile. While measures continued to be introduced to support and relieve financial burdens for households (such as phases 1-3 of the debt relief measures for retail borrowers), they were inadequate in a severe situation. Additional measures would be required to address such risks in a targeted and timely manner, in tandem with highly accommodative monetary policy to support economic recovery and prevent economic scarring, which could hinder the economy's growth prospects over the long-term and transmit risks to the financial system. The committees comprehensively assessed risks to financial stability and highlighted two priority areas. Addressing the issue of household debt, which had risen to 905 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). While a significant number of households were having problems servicing their debts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, looking ahead, debt serviceability could deteriorate further when interest rates increase or economic volatility rises. Although the BOT and relevant agencies had already introduced measures and made efforts to address the issue, the situation had worsened due to the new wave of outbreak. Hence immediate measures aimed to provide incentives and mechanisms to encourage financial institutions to restructure debts for highly indebted retail borrowers, with close monitoring of the progress and effectiveness of assistance. However based on an initial assessment, the size of support required by households would be beyond financial institutions' absorbing capacity alone. The role of the government and the capital market shall therefore be considered. In addition, the committees reckoned that solving the issue could be complicated as the risk of moral hazard must be taken into account. Moreover of the household debt number published by the BOT, roughly one quarter was lent by financial institutions outside the BOT's purview and the number also excluded certain types of borrowing such as informal debt. Therefore a holistic approach and a sustained recovery of household incomes would be required to tackle the issue of household debt in a sustainable and comprehensive manner. As for longer term solutions, the landscape of the Thai financial sector should be enhanced as follows: development of a credit information infrastructure that includes all types of debt held by households; promotion of responsible lending practices by creditors; promotion of borrowers' financial literacy and discipline; and introduction of more alternative financial service providers to help reduce informal debt. Preparing for macro-prudential measures to address potential build-up of risks under a prolonged low interest rate environment, which could eventually affect the stability of the Thai financial system. One such risk was the search for yield behavior by certain groups of investors, whose investments could be affected when interest rates rise. Hence a framework and mechanisms for the implementation of macro-prudential measures should be considered in advance and ready to be applied if required when the economy recovers fully. Implementation would necessitate effective coordination between the BOT and relevant government agencies to reduce risk build-ups and prevent the transmission of risks from a particular sector to other parts of the financial system. With high economic and financial uncertainties ahead, the BOT, the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Office of Insurance Commission (OIC) would continue to collaborate closely in assessing risks, monitoring the adequacy and effectiveness of measures undertaken, and striving to achieve policy targets. The regulators would stand ready to impose additional measures to contain financial stability risks and support economic recovery. Further cooperation with other government agencies would be essential going forward, while financial regulations should be coordinated and reviewed to ensure that they remain relevant in a changing economic and financial context."
Chile,2021-07-14,"NoPtrae sdse R eplereasnes*a Wednesday, 14 July 2021 Monetary Policy Meeting  July 2021 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 0.75%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of its members On the external front, incoming information show that the global outlook continues on a path of recovery, consolidating prospects for this year. This is particularly noticeable in countries displaying more controlled epidemiological conditions âthanks to either effective sanitary containment measures or the progress of vaccination campaignsâ, which have been able to continue with their plans to reopen their markets. However, many emerging economies are still lagging, while the spread of new strains of Covid-19 has emerged as a new risk factor. Financial markets have been influenced by the latest epidemiological developments and by surprises in actual data in the main economies. Thus, long-term interest rates have accumulated moderate declines, the dollar has appreciated against other currencies and stock markets have had mixed results, all within a context of persistent cost pressures, whether due to difficulties in the supply of goods, rising transportation costs and/or high input and commodity prices. Some monetary authorities, particularly the Federal Reserve, see these pressures as transitory, mitigating concerns about the recent rises in inflation. At the same time, several central banksâmainly those of commodity-exporting countriesâhave announced or begun launching a process of monetary policy normalization. Chile has seen further increases in market yields since the previous Meeting. In the case of nominal two-year term rates, an increase of around 110 bp was observed, explained by factors such as the change in the macroeconomic and monetary policy outlook. Regarding longer-term rates, the BCP10 saw significant volatility during the period, widening the gap with respect to its external peers. The peso depreciated, reaching its highest levels so far this year, which has coincided with the recent drop in copper prices and the worldwide strengthening of the U.S. dollar. With respect to bank credit, interest rate variations have been more contained, while the annual fall in the stock of commercial loans (-4.5% in real terms in June) is combined with steady positive flows in recent months, in an environment characterized by a high annual comparison base and ongoing rescheduling, refinancing and amortizations, together with the operation of special liquidity and guarantee programs. The second-quarter Bank Lending Survey reported a drop in demand by companies, both for investment and working capital purposes. Consumer loans continued to reduce their annual contraction (-14.6% in real terms in June), responding to the abundance of household liquidity, while flows in the mortgage segment look stable. As for activity, the May Imacec rose 18.1% annually, a figure that exceeded expectations and which led it to return to pre-pandemic levels. In seasonally-adjusted terms, the Imacec increased 2.6% month on month, showing growth in most sectors. Worth noting was the expansion of trade activity (51.3% annually), explained by highly dynamic consumption, which in turn has been boosted by the massive fiscal transfers and withdrawals of pension savings. The former have triggered a significant increase in public spending above the plans foreseen at the beginning of the year, which translates into a record-high fiscal impulse in 2021. In this context, private growth prospects for the year have continued to improve, up to 8% in July's Economic Expectations Survey. The labor market continues to be influenced by a number of opposing forces: while total employment is still far from pre-pandemic levels and the unemployment rate remains at around 10%, administrative records reveal a recovery of formal salaried employment, vacancies are rising significantly and higher annual growth is seen in the wage index. This points Nota de prensa to an unconventional behavior of the labor supply, affected by quarantines and state aid to informal and self-employment, as well as by the departure of hundreds of thousands of women from the labor market due to increased family responsibilities. Headline inflation rose to 3.8% annually in the June measurement. The main factor behind the increase in inflation of recent months has been the behavior of fuel prices, because of both recent months' increases and a low comparison base. Food prices, on the other hand, have been reducing their contribution. The annual variation of core CPIâwithout volatilesâis lower, remaining slightly above 3% annually. Regarding expectations, in the one-year term, the median of the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) and the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) rose to 3.3% and 3.4% annually. Two years ahead, both surveys are still around 3% annually. The Board estimates that this aggregate background information is similar to the economic trajectory foreseen in the base scenario of the June Monetary Policy Report. Thus, the activity gap will continue to close rapidly, accompanied by a high fiscal impulse and a strongly dynamic consumption. This creates the conditions for a gradual withdrawal of the monetary impulse, which is expressed in a 25bp increase in the MPR at this meeting, where the signals obtained so far make the scenarios that mark the limits of the rate corridor of the June Report unlikely. In any case, even in a context of gradual normalization, monetary policy will continue to accompany the recovery of the economy. Thus, starting from one of the most expansive levels among comparable economies, the Board anticipates that the MPR will be below its neutral value throughout the two-year policy horizon. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours on Friday, 30 July 2021. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will be held on Tuesday, 31 August 2021, and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours the same day. ____The Spanish original prevails.

Turkiye,2021-07-14,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 19 percent. The worldwide speeding up of vaccination rollout, especially in developed countries, supports the global economic recovery. Nonetheless, economies advancing in their vaccination programs exhibit a stronger performance in economic activity by easing the restrictions. The strong recovery in the global demand, increasing trend of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and the rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. The effects of the rising global inflation and inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant. Domestic economic activity is strong. While domestic demand has slightly decelerated in the second quarter due to pandemic restrictions and the tightening in financial conditions, external demand remains strong. The acceleration of domestic vaccination rollout facilitates the recovery in services and tourism sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. Commercial loan growth exhibits a mild course. The effects of the implemented macroprudential measures will be monitored on personal loans, which recently displayed a rise due to the reopening and deferred demand. Favorable external demand conditions and current tight monetary policy impact the current account balance positively. The current account is expected to post a surplus in the rest of the year due to the strong upward trend in exports, and the strong progress in the vaccination program stimulating tourism activities. In addition to the recent increases in import prices and administered prices, demand conditions, supply constraints in some sectors, possible volatility in inflation during the summer due to the reopening, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is being observed. Taking into account the high levels of inflation and inflation expectations, the current tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively until the significant fall in the April Inflation Report's forecast path is achieved. Accordingly, the MPC has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The policy rate will continue to be determined at a level above inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is reached. The stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and perpetual decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Korea,2021-07-15,"The bank of korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period. Currently available information suggests that the recovery of the global economy has strengthened, supported by accelerated vaccinations and the relaxation of restrictions on economic activity in major countries. In global financial markets, stock prices have continued to rise, reflecting the economic recovery. The US dollar has strengthened, while long-term government bond yields have declined considerably due mainly to the spread of COVID-19 variants. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by national policy responses and their effects. The Korean economy has continued its sound recovery. Exports and facilities investment have sustained their buoyancy and private consumption has shown improvement. Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed remaining high. Going forward, exports and investment will sustain their buoyancy, while private consumption is forecast to temporarily weaken affected by the coronavirus resurgence but then return to the path of recovery supported by the execution of a supplementary budget. GDP growth this year is projected to be around 4%, consistent with the forecast in May. Consumer price inflation has remained high at the mid-2% level due to the rising prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products as well as the accelerating increase in service prices. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has run at the lower-1% level. The inflation expectations of the general public have risen slightly to the lower-to mid-2% range. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will continue to run in the lower- to mid-2% range for some time, exceeding the path projected in May. Core inflation is forecast to increase gradually to the mid-1% range. In domestic financial markets, stock prices and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate have risen, mainly driven by global financial market movements. The 3-year Korean Treasury bond yield has risen considerably, while the 10-year yield has fallen. Household loan growth has remained high, showing a record level on a first-half basis, and housing prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board will maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy as there remain uncertainties posed by the virus, although the Korean economy is expected to continue its recovery and inflation to remain at a high level for some time. In this process the Board will judge whether it is appropriate to adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to COVID-19, changes in the pace of growth and inflation, and the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances."
Euroarea,2021-07-22,"Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. At today's meeting, the Governing Council focused on two main topics: first, the implications of our strategy review for our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates; and, second, our assessment of the economy and our pandemic measures. In our recent strategy review, we agreed a symmetric inflation target of two per cent over the medium term. Our policy rates have been close to their lower bound for some time and the medium-term outlook for inflation is still well below our target. In these conditions, the Governing Council today revised its forward guidance on interest rates. We did so to underline our commitment to maintain a persistently accommodative monetary policy stance to meet our inflation target. In support of our symmetric two per cent inflation target and in line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until we see inflation reaching two per cent well ahead of the end of our projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and we judge that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at two per cent over the medium term. This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target. Let me turn to the assessment of the economic outlook and our pandemic measures. More and more people are getting vaccinated, and lockdown restrictions have been eased in most euro area countries. But the pandemic continues to cast a shadow, especially as the delta variant constitutes a growing source of uncertainty. Inflation has picked up, although this increase is expected to be mostly temporary. The outlook for inflation over the medium term remains subdued. We need to preserve favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy over the pandemic period. This is essential for the current rebound to turn into a lasting expansion and to offset the negative impact of the pandemic on inflation. Therefore, having confirmed our June assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, we continue to expect purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) over the current quarter to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year. We also confirmed our other measures to support our price stability mandate, namely the level of the key ECB interest rates, our purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), our reinvestment policies and our longer-term refinancing operations, as detailed in the press release published at 13:45 today. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilises at our two per cent target over the medium term. I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing, and then talk about our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. The economy rebounded in the second quarter of the year and, as restrictions are eased, is on track for strong growth in the third quarter. We expect manufacturing to perform strongly, even though supply bottlenecks are holding back production in the near term. The reopening of large parts of the economy is supporting a vigorous bounce-back in the services sector. But the delta variant of the coronavirus could dampen this recovery in services, especially in tourism and hospitality. As people return to shops and restaurants and resume travelling, consumer spending is rising. Better job prospects, increasing confidence and continued government support are reinforcing spending. The ongoing recovery in domestic and global demand is boosting optimism among businesses. For the first time since the start of the pandemic, our bank lending survey indicates that funding of fixed investment is an important factor driving the demand for loans to firms. We expect economic activity to return to its pre-crisis level in the first quarter of next year. But there is still a long way to go before the damage to the economy caused by the pandemic is offset. The number of people in job retention schemes has been declining but remains high. Overall, there are still 3.3 million fewer people employed than before the pandemic, especially among the younger and lower skilled. Ambitious, targeted and coordinated fiscal policy should continue to complement monetary policy in supporting the recovery. In this context, the Next Generation EU programme has a key role to play. It will contribute to a stronger and uniform recovery across euro area countries. It will also accelerate the green and digital transitions and support necessary structural reforms that lift long-term growth. We expect inflation to increase further over the coming months and to decline again next year. The current increase is largely being driven by higher energy prices and by base effects from the sharp fall in oil prices at the start of the pandemic and the impact of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany last year. By early 2022, the impact of these factors should fade out as they fall out of the year-on-year inflation calculation. In the near term, the significant slack in the economy is holding back underlying inflationary pressures. Stronger demand and temporary cost pressures in the supply chain will put some upward pressure on prices. But weak wage growth and the past appreciation of the euro mean that price pressures will likely remain subdued for some time. There is still some way to go before the fallout from the pandemic on inflation is eliminated. As the economy recovers, supported by our monetary policy measures, we expect inflation to rise over the medium term, although remaining below our target. While measures of longer-term inflation expectations have increased, they remain some distance from our two per cent target. Economic activity could outperform our expectations if consumers spend more than currently expected and draw more rapidly on the savings they have built up during the pandemic. A faster improvement in the pandemic situation could also lead to a stronger expansion than currently envisaged. But growth could underperform our expectations if the pandemic intensifies or if supply shortages turn out to be more persistent and hold back production. The recovery of growth and inflation still depends on favourable financing conditions. Financing conditions for most firms and households remain at favourable levels. Bank lending rates for firms and households remain historically low. Firms are still well funded as a result of their borrowing in the first wave of the pandemic, which in part explains why lending to firms has slowed. Our most recent bank lending survey shows that credit conditions for both firms and households have stabilised. At the same time, the cost for firms of issuing equity is still high. Many firms and households have taken on more debt to weather the pandemic. Any worsening of the economy could therefore threaten their financial health, which could trickle through to the quality of banks' balance sheets. It remains essential to prevent balance sheet strains and tightening financing conditions from reinforcing each other. But the outlook continues to depend on the course of the pandemic and progress with vaccinations. The current rise in inflation is expected to be largely temporary. Underlying price pressures will likely increase gradually, although leaving inflation over the medium term still well below our target. Our policy measures, including our revised forward guidance, will help the economy shift to a solid recovery and, ultimately, bring inflation to our two per cent target."
Ukraine,2021-07-22,"The NBU Board has decided to raise the key policy rate to 8% per annum. Given the significant increase in underlying inflationary pressures, this step is necessary to return inflation to 5% in 2022 and keep inflation expectations in check. As anticipated, inflation in H1 2021 breached its 5% Â± 1 pp target range, but the deviation, driven by both short-lived and fundamental factors, was more significant than expected. In June 2021, consumer inflation remained at the level of the previous month (9.5% yoy), but was still higher than the NBU's April forecast (9.2% yoy). On the one hand, this was primarily due to temporary increases in global food and energy prices. On the other hand, underlying inflationary pressures have intensified significantly. Specifically, core inflation in June accelerated to 7.3% yoy and significantly exceeded the April forecast (6.8% yoy), fueled primarily by sustained strong consumer demand and rising production costs in businesses, particularly in wages. The rise in inflationary pressure, including its fundamental component, is also driven by the dynamic recovery of the economy, as evidenced by monthly and other high-frequency indicators. More specifically, the index of key sector output climbed by 18.3% yoy in April and by 4.1% yoy in May, while the business activity expectations index in June reached its highest level since October 2019. At the same time, favorable FX market conditions and the stabilization of inflation expectations restrained underlying inflationary pressures to some extent. Inflation will soon rise to slightly above 10%, but it will weaken at the end of 2021 and return to its 5% target in H2 2022. With global prices surging and demand recovering further, the NBU has revised its 2021 inflation forecast from 8% to 9.6%. After peaking in the fall of this year, inflation will begin to slow as the new harvest arrives and global energy prices adjust. By tightening its monetary policy, in particular through raising its key policy rate and rolling back its emergency monetary measures, the NBU will also keep inflation expectations under control and gradually reduce underlying inflationary pressures. As a result, inflation in H2 2022 will decline to its 5% target and remain there going forward. The NBU has left its 20212023 real GDP growth forecast unchanged at about 4% a year. Robust consumer demand and benign foreign trade conditions will make up for the losses to the Ukrainian economy due to the winter and spring lockdowns. In view of this, the NBU has maintained its 2021 real GDP growth forecast at 3.8%. Subsequently, the economy will grow by about 4% annually. In addition to high private consumption, this growth will be driven by strong demand for Ukrainian exports, as well as a revival of investment activity by businesses. In 2021, the current account will return to a small deficit, which will significantly expand in the years ahead as domestic demand increases and terms of trade turn less favorable. The current account of the balance of payments will record a deficit of 0.4% of GDP in 2021. This will be due to the growth in domestic demand, the resumption of travel services imports, and higher dividend payments. These factors will only be partially offset by good terms of trade and record grain yields. In 20222023, the current account deficit will widen significantly as domestic demand continues to rise and terms of trade worsen. The main assumption of the macroeconomic forecast taken into account by the NBU Board is continued cooperation with the IMF. The NBU expects further progress to be made in negotiations between Ukraine and the IMF. Long delays in the performance of the agreement on cooperation with the IMF would create risks to financing the state budget deficit, especially in the coming years. This could also deteriorate inflation and exchange rate expectations, forcing the central bank to tighten its monetary policy. Conversely, the performance of the IMF cooperation program would enable Ukraine to raise the planned amount of official financing, while making it cheaper to borrow on the external and domestic markets. This would also help maintain Ukraine's international reserves at USD 29 to 31 billion in 2021  2023. The key risks to the macroeconomic forecast are the imposition of stricter quarantine measures in Ukraine and globally, and a longer and more pronounced than expected surge in global inflation. The Ukrainian economy could sustain new economic losses because of new coronavirus variants, such as the Delta variant, which are spreading rapidly across the world. That said, the NBU estimates that the negative contribution to annual real GDP of all of the quarantine restrictions that were imposed in H1 2021 was 0.6 pp. In contrast to the quarantine restrictions that were in place in the spring of 2020, the latest restrictions did not have any curbing effect on inflation, mainly due to sustained robust consumer demand. The probability of a longer and more pronounced surge in global inflation is rising, driven by significant fiscal and monetary stimuli. This creates risks of greater imported inflation to Ukraine, and of leading central banks tightening their monetary policies more quickly. The latter development could decrease investors' interest in the emerging markets, including Ukraine. Other pro-inflationary risks remain important, such as an escalation of the military conflict with Russia and a sharp deterioration in terms of trade. In view of the above balance of risks, the NBU Board has decided to raise the key policy rate to 8%, and to tighten monetary policy through some additional measures. continuing the phasing out of anti-crisis measuressetting the interest rate on refinancing loans at the level of the key policy rate + 1 pp for fixed rate tender, and no less than this level for variable rate tenderdecreasing the planned amounts of daily interventions to purchase FX on the interbank FX market from USD 20 million to USD 5 million. The NBU's forecast envisages that the key policy rate will be raised further, to 8.5%, and maintained at that level until Q2 2022, with a view to bringing inflation back to its 5% target in 2022, and keeping inflation expectations in check. If additional pro-inflationary risks materialize, the NBU stands ready to continue deploying monetary tools to return inflation to its 5% target. The decision to raise the key policy rate, to 8% was approved by NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No.342, dated 22 July 2021. Ð new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 29 July 2021. A summary of the discussion between Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 2 August 2021. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 9 September 2021, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
South Africa,2021-07-22,"PRESS STATEMENT 22 July 2021 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Despite steady improvements in vaccination rates, stronger confidence and better global economic growth, the Covid-19 virus continues to weigh on global prospects. Vaccination rates are lagging in many emerging market and developing countries. Until populations develop sufficient immunity to curb virus transmission, waves of infection are likely to continue. As indicated by South Africa's public health authorities, a third wave of virus infection is currently peaking. Additionally, by raising uncertainty and reducing investor confidence, the recent unrest in parts of the country is likely to slow our ongoing recovery. Lockdowns and other restrictive measures that remain in place in a number of countries will continue to weigh on economic activity, particularly in sectors dependent on close contact, such as travel, tourism, hospitality and leisure. The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) April forecast for global gross domestic product (GDP) for 2021 MPC Statement 22 July 2021 Page 1. The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) April forecast for global gross domestic product (GDP) for 2021 MPC Statement 22 July 2021 Page 1 is 6.0%, and will be updated later this month. The SARB's forecast for global growth in 2021 now sits at 6.1%.1 For 2022, we expect global growth of 4.4% and 3.4% in 2023. Recoveries in emerging market and developing economies are expected to lag those in advanced economies, in large part due to a slower pace of vaccinations. Although policy settings in advanced economies remain accommodative, the spread of the Delta variant, higher global inflation, and uncertainty about the normalisation path for interest rates continue to cause financial market and capital flow volatility. This is reflected in persistent risk aversion, especially towards emerging market economies that fail to take advantage of improved global prospects or run large macroeconomic imbalances. The domestic economy grew by 4.6% in the first quarter of 2021, much stronger than the 2.7% expected at the time of our May meeting. That outcome reflected better sectoral growth performances and robust terms of trade. Commodity prices have remained high, sustaining income gains despite higher oil prices. However, recent unrest and economic damage could have lasting effects on investor confidence and job creation. We estimate the unrest to have fully negated the better growth results from the first quarter, resulting in an unchanged estimate of 4.2% for growth in 2021. The direct and indirect costs of recent events will likely further slow South Africa's economic recovery. Although some sectors, notably mining and manufacturing have largely recovered to pre-pandemic levels, production remains muted in sectors harder hit by the pandemic and in regions now affected by the unrest. The Bank's investment 1 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. The IMF's global forecast for 2022 sits at 4.4%. MPC Statement 22 July 2021 Page 2 forecast was revised up for this year but remains constrained. Household spending is still expected to be healthy, in line with better than expected salaries and wages, rising asset prices and low interest rates. GDP is expected to grow by 2.3% in 2022 and by 2.4% in 2023, unchanged since the May meeting. Overall, and after revisions, the risks to the medium-term domestic growth outlook are assessed to be balanced. High export prices, stronger household incomes and a somewhat better investment outlook are backed up by generally supportive global conditions, despite ongoing financial volatility. Recent events in the country, their impact on vaccinations, a longer than expected lockdown, limited energy supply and policy uncertainty pose downside risks to growth. The current account surplus remains substantial and reflects good growth and higher prices for exports, still moderate prices for imported oil, and slowly reviving demand for imported consumer and investment goods. This surplus is expected to give way to a modest current account deficit by next year (2022), as exports slow and imports accelerate.2 Although financing conditions have improved and fiscal risk has eased, the yield curve for rand-denominated bonds remains steep. Long bond yields have returned to pre-pandemic levels of around 9.0% on 10-year bonds. The generally favourable global conditions and strong commodity export prices have kept the currency close to its long-run equilibrium level, with a year to date appreciation of 4% on a trade-weighted basis. Since the May meeting, the rand has depreciated 2 The current account is expected to be in surplus of 3.7% of GDP in 2021, shifting to a deficit of -0.1% in 2022. MPC Statement 22 July 2021 Page 3 by 0.5% on a trade-weighted basis. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R14.40 to the US dollar, compared with R14.46 at the time of the previous meeting. At a global level, a wide range of prices is accelerating, including raw materials, intermediate inputs and food, reflecting both global supply shortages and rising demand. So far, this has had relatively limited pass-through to consumer prices. Our estimate for inflation in the G3 economies was revised slightly higher for 2021 to 2.2% (from 2.0%) and lower in the outer years.3 Oil prices are revised up, and petrol price inflation is sharply higher at 15.3% (up from 12.5%).4 Local electricity prices are unchanged at 10.6%. Headline consumer price inflation for 2021 is revised slightly higher to 4.3% (up from 4.2%), and revised lower to 4.2% (from 4.4%) in 2022. For 2023, headline consumer price inflation remains unchanged at 4.5%. The forecast for core inflation is revised lower to 2.9% in 2021 (down from 3.0%) and to 3.7% in 2022 (down from 4.0%). Core inflation is expected to be 4.3% in 2023, unchanged from the May forecast. The Bank's forecast reflects higher food and petrol prices that push up near term headline inflation, before moderating in the latter half of this year and into 2022. Compared to the May meeting, the current growth forecast implies a wider output gap in the near term. While economic activity strengthens over the forecast period, the 3 The G3 comprises the United States, the Eurozone, and Japan. 4 The forecast for petrol prices in 2022 are revised up from 3.9% in May to 5.5% currently. Our assumptions are now for oil prices to average $66 per barrel in 2021 and $65 per barrel in 2022 and $63 in 2023. MPC Statement 22 July 2021 Page 4 current exchange rate level and modest growth in unit labour costs contain the expected rise in core inflation. The risks to the short-term inflation outlook are assessed to the upside, despite weaker than expected services inflation outcomes in recent months. Rapid global producer price inflation and supply shortages created by disruptions to local transport networks increase these inflation risks. Food price inflation, already very high globally, surprised to the upside in recent months. Petrol, electricity and other administered prices also continue to present short-term risks. Average surveyed expectations of future inflation have increased by 0.3 percentage points, to 4.2% for 2021 and by 0.2 percentage points, to 4.4% for 2022. Market- based expectations for inflation are slightly higher for 2021 and lower over longer horizons.5 Given the medium and long-term projections set out above, a weaker currency, higher domestic import tariffs, and escalating wage demands present longer-term upside risks to the inflation forecast. Despite higher expectations and continued upside risks, the Committee expects inflation to be contained in 2021 and 2022, before rising to around the midpoint of the inflation target range in 2023. 5 The (Q2) Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey expectations for 2021 rose to 4.2% (up from 3.9%), to 4.4% from 4.2% for 2022, and to 4.5% from 4.4% for 2023. Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) in July expect inflation to be higher at 4.3% (from 4.2%) in 2021, and 4.4% in 2022, up from 4.3%, and unchanged at 4.4% in 2023. Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These now sit at 4.6% for the 5-year and 5.88% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year breakeven inflation sits at 6.37%. MPC Statement 22 July 2021 Page 5 Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep rates unchanged at 3.5% per annum. The implied policy rate path of the Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) indicates an increase of 25 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2021 and in each quarter of 2022. These repurchase rate levels reflect a highly accommodative policy stance through the end of 2022, keeping financial conditions supportive of credit demand as the economy recovers from the pandemic and associated lockdowns.6 The Bank has ensured adequate liquidity in domestic markets and will continue to closely monitor funding markets for stress. In addition, regulatory relief provided to banks continues to support lending to households and firms. Better anchored expectations of future inflation could keep interest rates lower for longer, and can be realised by achieving a stable public debt level, increasing the supply of energy, moderating administered price inflation and keeping wage inflation low into the recovery. Such steps will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy. Economic and financial conditions are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. In this uncertain environment, policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. The MPC will seek to look through temporary price shocks and focus on second round effects. As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting in response to new data and risks. 6 This implies a rise in the inflation-adjusted repo rate from about -1.0% for 2021 to about 0.5% by the end of 2022. The real repurchase rate calculation here is based on the 1-quarter ahead inflation forecast.

Russia,2021-07-23,"On 23 July 2021, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to increase the key rate by 100 b.p., to 6.50% per annum. According to the Bank of Russia's estimates, the Russian economy reached its pre-pandemic level in 2021 Q2. The contribution of persistent factors to inflation increased due to faster growth of demand compared to output expansion capacity. Taking into account high inflation expectations, this has significantly shifted the balance of risks towards proinflationary ones and may cause inflation to deviate upwards from the target for a longer period. The key rate decision taken aims to constrain this risk and to return inflation to 4%. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate increase at its upcoming meetings. Key rate decisions will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, annual inflation will reach 5.7-6.2% in 2021. Given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will edge down to 4.0-4.5% in 2022 and will remain close to 4% further on. Inflation dynamics. Inflation is developing above the Bank of Russia's forecast. In June, seasonally adjusted consumer price growth slowed down slightly compared to May, remaining elevated. Annual inflation grew to 6.5% (vs 6.0% in May) and, according to estimates as of 19 July, remained unchanged. Based on Bank of Russia estimates, indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements substantially exceed 4% (annualised). This largely reflects the fact that steady growth in domestic demand exceeds production expansion capacity in a wide range of sectors. In this context, businesses find it easier to transfer higher costs to prices. Inflation expectations of households continue to grow, remaining close to their highest level for the last four years for more than six months. Businesses' price expectations remain near their multi-year highs. Analysts' medium-term expectations are anchored close to 4%. The dominating influence of proinflationary factors could lead to a more substantial and prolonged deviation of inflation upwards from the target. The key rate decision taken aims to constrain this risk and to return annual inflation to 4%. According to the baseline scenario, annual inflation will reach 5.7-6.2% in 2021. Given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will edge down to 4.0-4.5% in 2022 and will remain close to 4% further on. Monetary conditions remain accommodative given elevated inflation expectations and actual inflation. In this context, lending continues to grow at rates close to recent years' highs. Yields of short-term OFZs rose, reflecting the expectations of a faster-than-expected key rate hike by the Bank of Russia. A trend towards growth in loan and deposit interest rates is also emerging, with growth in deposit rates taking place at a slower pace so far. Today's decision of the Bank of Russia will speed up the adjustment of bank interest rates to the monetary policy pursued. This will make it possible to raise the attractiveness of bank deposits for households, protect the purchasing power of savings, and ensure balanced lending expansion. Economic activity. According to the Bank of Russia's estimates, the Russian economy reached its pre-pandemic level in 2021 Q2. High-frequency indicators point to steady growth of consumer and investment demand. As estimated by the Bank of Russia, consumer activity has already exceeded its pre-pandemic levels. Despite a partial tightening of restrictions, the household services sector continues to recover actively. Inflation pressure from the labour market intensifies. Demand for labour force is growing in a wide range of industries, with certain sectors experiencing a deficit in part due to remaining restrictions on the inflow of labour migrants. The Russian economy is also supported by external demand demonstrating a robust growth. However, supply-side limitations in the global economy have exacerbated. In this context, prices in global commodity markets remain close to multi-year highs despite the downward adjustment in JuneâJuly. Taking into account the situation in the Russian and global economy as well as the July OPEC+ decision to expand oil production, the Bank of Russia forecasts Russian GDP growth of 4.04.5% in 2021. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, in 20222023, the Russian economy will grow 2.03.0% annually. Over a mid-term horizon, domestic demand trends will largely depend on further growth rates of consumer and investment demand. Consumer demand will be supported by household income growth and lending. Domestic demand will be influenced by the process of fiscal policy normalisation in view of the announced additional social and infrastructural measures. External demand movements will be mostly dependent on the pace of vaccination and the normalisation of the epidemic situation world-wide. Inflation risks. The balance of risks remains significantly shifted towards proinflationary ones. Their effect may be strengthened by elevated inflation expectations and corresponding secondary effects. Inflationary pressures may originate from a stronger-than-expected decline in households' propensity to save, propelled by the combination of low interest rates and growing prices. Further upward pressure on prices may continue to come from remaining disruptions in production and supply chains, as well as structural changes in the labour market as a result of the pandemic. Proinflationary risks are still generated by price movements in global commodity markets. However, they have somewhat declined as prices for certain goods started to go down in June and July. Further movements of food prices will largely depend on agricultural harvest in 2021 both in Russia and abroad. Short-term proinflationary risks are also associated with the stronger volatility in global markets caused in part by various geopolitical developments, which may affect exchange rate and inflation expectations. Also, given that the global economic recovery is progressing at faster paces than previously expected and the need is no longer in place for unprecedentedly accommodative policies in advanced economies, an earlier monetary policy normalisation in these countries is possible. This may become a further driver of volatility growth in global financial markets. Disinflationary risks for the baseline scenario remain moderate. Opening up the borders concurrently with a gradual lifting of restrictions may lead to a recovery in the consumption of foreign services and weaken supply-side constraints in the labour market owing to an inflow of foreign labour force. Subsequent economic growth may be held back by, among other things, low vaccination rates and the spread of new coronavirus strains, as well as the ensuing tightening of restrictions. Medium-term inflation is largely influenced by fiscal policy. In its baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia proceeds from the fiscal policy normalisation path stipulated by the Guidelines for Fiscal. Tax and Customs and Tariff Policy for 2021 and the 20222023 Planning Period, which assumes a return to fiscal rule parameters in 2022. The Bank of Russia' forecast will also factor in the impact of the decisions to invest the liquid part of the National Wealth Fund in excess of the threshold level of 7% of GDP. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate increase at its upcoming meetings. Key rate decisions will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 10 September 2021. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting of 23 July 2021 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast. Statement by Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina in follow-up to Board of Directors meeting on 23 July 2021.

Kazakhstan,2021-07-26,"Press-Release  12 The base rate raised to 9.25% July 26, 2021 Nur-Sultan The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to set the base rate at 9.25% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1.0 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities set on 10.25% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 8.25%. Weighted tightening of the monetary policy is caused by the need to forestall the risks of twisting an inflationary spiral and return inflation to the target band of 4-6% in 2022. Meanwhile, the influence of the unstable epidemiological situation in the world and, in particular, in Kazakhstan, on the recovery of business activity was taken into account. The raise in the rate will maintain the attractiveness of tenge assets, which will increase the efficiency of pricing in the foreign exchange and money markets, in order to form expectations that exclude unwanted balances. The decision was stipulated by realized inflation risks from supply and sustained inflationary pressure in the economy from the demand. Inflation is forming above forecasts, while expectations for further price increases remain high and loose. The rapid restoration of economic growth and the dynamics of consumer activity, with a significant fiscal impulse, form a pro-inflationary trend. At the same time, such important factors as the rise in prices for certain groups of food products due to the general global trend of growing food prices, disruptions in supply chains, rising producer prices accompanied by increasing prices for raw materials and supplies, as well as the continuing potential for growth in regulated prices are concentrated on supply side. International experience shows that the impact of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy on supply shocks is limited, and inflation adjustment to these changes is unavoidable. Based on this practice, the National Bank, by its decision, responds to a greater extent to risks from the demand associated with increased inflation expectations. By the end of June 2021 the annual inflation amounted to 7.9% (7.2% in May 2021). As a result of the risks realization, all components of inflation have increased. A significant uncharacteristic for the summer months' price increase of 1.1%, in June 2021 is the highest value for the given month since 2009. Food inflation accelerated to 10.6% in June 2021 and continued to bring in the major contribution to total inflation. This is related to a sharp rise in the prices of vegetables, in particular, potatoes, carrots and beets. This growth sets a record and is observed not only in Kazakhstan, but also in neighboring countries (Russia. Uzbekistan. Tajikistan). In general, food price increases have been observed around the world. Thus, the FAO food price index in June 2021 demonstrated an increase of 33.9% in annual terms. The non-food component of inflation accelerated to 6.9% in June 2021 in view of the risks realization of the deferred demand effect. The annual growth rate of gasoline prices continued to accelerate due to the producer price growth and continued recovery of demand. The recovering consumer demand also contributed to the rise in prices for clothing, footwear, cars, household appliances and furniture. Additional pro-inflationary pressure on non-food products is provided by the increasing prices for import deliveries due to accelerating inflation in trading partner countries and growing world prices for raw materials and intermediate materials. The annual growth in prices for paid services to the population amounted to 5.6% in June, which was associated with the rise in prices for both regulated and unregulated services. An annual increase in prices for air transport services, travel services (sanatoriums, holiday homes, trips abroad), personal care services and home renovation services has been observed. The inflation expectations of the population remain unstable. In June, the quantitative assessment for the year ahead increased and amounted to 7.3%. The share of respondents who noted a very high price increase over the last month reached a historical maximum, rising to 59% (in May - 49%). In addition, in June, the share of respondents who noted an increase in food prices rose to 87%. The situation in the real sector of the economy continued to improve. For the first half of 2021, real GDP growth amounted to 2.2% in annual terms. The economy is recovering owing to the rising global commodity prices and easing quarantine restrictions. The manufacturing industry, trade, construction, information and communications, and agriculture showed a stable growth in January- June 2021. The results of a survey of enterprises by the National Bank also indicate an improvement in sentiment in the real sector. Thus, in June 2021, the business activity index increased by 0.5 points, amounting to 51.6 (in May 2021 - 51.1). The rate of decline in investment activity is slowing down. At the end of the first half of 2021, the decline in investment in fixed assets amounted to 1.8%, with a decrease in the first quarter by 9.6%. A significant recovery in consumer activity of the population exerts notable inflationary pressure. In the first half of 2021, retail turnover increased by 7.6% (y/y) after a decrease of 1.2% (y/y) in the first quarter. In the structure of retail trade turnover, the turnover of non-food products is growing at an accelerated pace. The growth of household consumption is supported by positive growth rates of household income, as well as a significant increase in lending for consumer purposes. The recovery of domestic demand given the fiscal stimulus is reflected in a significant increase in consumer imports. In 5 months of 2021 the import of consumer goods increased to 4.7 billion US dollars, which is 30.4% higher than the pre-epidemic level of 2019. The global economy continues to recover, however, the epidemiological situation, which has affected the increase in demand for goods and services and supply disruptions, creates significant risks of a prolonged wave of inflation in the world. According to the IMF forecasts, this year the growth rate of the world economy will be 6.0%, in 2022 it will slow down to 4.4%. Economic growth is also expected to recover in the trading partner countries: the EU economy will grow by 4.4% in 2021. Russia-by 3.8%. China-by 8.4%. At the same time, a significant spread of the COVID-19 delta strain has been recorded in many countries of the world. Restrictive measures are being resumed, which, in turn, negatively affects business activity in the manufacture and services industries. Thus, the Global Composite PMI in June fell to 56.6 points for the first time since January 2021 (in May 2021  58.5 points). Manufacturers report that demand for goods remains high, however, production volumes are declining due to the disruption of global supply chains and high prices for raw materials and intermediate goods. The resumed increase in incidence, as well as supply disruptions, also had a negative impact on world trade, as evidenced by the weaker indicators of the 2 leading indicators of the New Export Orders Index PMI in June 2021 (a decrease from 54.9 points in May to 53.2 in June 2021). The factor of the predominance of demand for goods over supply enlarge the risk of an increase in inflationary pressure in the world. The global trend of inflation growth also affected the countries  the main trading partners of Kazakhstan. In the EU and Russia, inflation is formed above the target indicators. In the EU, in June 2021, annual inflation accelerated to 2.2% with a target of 2.0%. In China, after the deflation noted at the beginning of the year, annual inflation rose to 1.1% in June 2021. In Russia, annual inflation in June reached 6.5% (the maximum since August 2016) with a target of 4.0%. In response, monetary conditions in Russia have been tightening since the beginning of 2021. With the latest decision, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation raised the rate immediately by 100 b.p. to 6.5%. The trend of tightening monetary policy is also observed in other countries. Thus, in 2021, 18 central banks have already raised key rates to slow down inflationary processes. There is significant volatility in the global oil market due to the growing uncertainty associated with the spread of the COVID-19 delta strain. During June, the average monthly price of Brent crude oil grew and varied in the range of 70.3  76.2 US dollars per barrel. However, in July, after the OPEC+ countries reached an agreement on a monthly increase in oil production by 400 thousand barrels per day from August of this year and a revision of the production quota for some members of the alliance from May 2022, the price range expanded to 68.6  77.2 US dollars per barrel. Despite the increase in demand for oil and a decrease in its reserves, the main source of increased volatility on world markets is the further spread of the coronavirus delta strain, which reduces the forecasts accuracy for further price dynamics and may slow down the global economic recovery and, accordingly, reduce oil demand. Taking into account the lags of the base rate changes impact on the economy and the expected inflation exceeding the target range of 4-6% by the end of 2021, subsequent decisions of the National Bank on the base rate will be made by taking into account the inflation entry into the target range in 2022. Based on the results of the upcoming forecast round in September 2021, the National Bank is ready to take measures to further tighten monetary conditions in case of an increase in pro- inflationary factors. In the second half of 2021, a further acceleration of inflation is possible given the seasonally low base of food inflation in July and August last year, as well as the implementation of the deferred demand effect. The next planned decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on September 13, 2021 at 15:00 Nur- Sultan time.

Hungary,2021-07-27,"At its meeting on 27 July 2021, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 28 July 2021:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability under the Bank's extended mandate effective from 2 August 2021. Over the past months, the reopening of economies has begun, the pace of which has been driven by developments in the pandemic and the population's vaccination level. World trade and global industrial production are already above the levels seen before the pandemic. In June, forward-looking confidence indicators of the manufacturing and services sectors suggested a positive outlook. However, a repeated pick-up in case numbers in recent weeks indicates that the fourth wave of coronavirus is approaching. International risk appetite deteriorated due to the impending next wave of the pandemic, global supply problems and reflation concerns. Consistent with this, the US dollar appreciated against developed and emerging market currencies. Commodity prices have risen significantly since the beginning of 2021. Global oil prices eased back from USD 77 at the beginning of July to around USD 70 by the middle of the month. At its policy meeting in July, the European Central Bank (ECB) confirmed that it would maintain the higher pace of purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) in the third quarter. According to ECB's forward guidance, interest rates will remain durably at or below current levels until inflation reaches the 2 percent target. The ECB released the results of the review of its monetary policy strategy at the beginning of July, in which it set a 2 percent symmetric inflation target. In addition, the ECB also accepted an action plan regarding climate change. As part of this, the ECB will review how to include climate protection considerations in its monetary policy framework in the future. A number of central banks in the region have indicated recently that they would stand ready to tighten monetary conditions when necessary due to the increase in the outlook for inflation. In the second half of June, the Czech central bank raised its policy rate by 25 basis points, while the central banks of Poland and Romania left policy rates unchanged. Hungarian economic growth continued in the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. In May, the performance of industry and construction improved compared with the previous month and a year earlier. The volume of retail sales rose year on year, but it was unchanged relative to the previous month. Real earnings, affecting mostly household consumption, rose further, while wage growth picked up compared with the previous month. The unemployment rate fell and remained at a level considered low by international standards. The Hungarian economy was restarted in the second quarter, and as a result of the earlier opening than the European average the pace of economic recovery picked up significantly. Real-time data point to double-digit economic growth in the second quarter. Hungarian economic output is expected to recover to pre-crisis levels in the third quarter. The rapid recovery in industry has been followed by construction and retail trade, while the recovery in the service sector, which is most exposed to the pandemic, will take longer. The historically high investment rate is expected to continue rising on the forecast horizon. Hungarian export performance is expected to improve markedly in 2021 as external markets recover. The increase in the production of new export capacities built in previous years causes a dynamic expansion of exports over the entire forecast horizon. Household demand is likely to pick up gradually. The Hungarian economy is expected to rise by around 6 percent in 2021, by 5.5 percent in 2022 and by 3.5 percent in 2023. According to expectations the economic recovery in Hungary could prove to be one of the fastest compared with other European countries as well. In June 2021, annual inflation was 5.3 percent, and core inflation stood at 3.8 percent. The consumer price index and core inflation rose by 0.2 percentage points and 0.4 percentage points, respectively, relative to the previous month. Incoming inflation data exceeded the Bank's projection and market expectations. Since May, the pace of increase in the prices of services and industrial goods has accelerated further. Underlying measures of inflation also increased. Inflation data confirm that inflationary effects, arising from the reopening of the economy, were already strong in June. Inflation is expected to decline gradually in the coming months, but to stay above the central bank tolerance band until the end of 2021. Inflation is then projected to fall back to the central bank tolerance band again at the beginning of 2022 and to stabilise around the bank target from mid-2022 as a result of the monetary policy tightening cycle. Upside risks to the outlook for inflation have generally increased. Inflation in the euro area and the US has risen since the beginning of the year. Sustained rises in commodity prices and international freight costs point to a higher external inflation environment. Demand-supply frictions, emerging temporarily due to the rapid restart of the domestic economy, and the renewed tightening of labour market capacities expected in certain sectors, combined with dynamic wage growth, have increased inflation risks. Following 8.1 percent in 2020, from 2021 the government deficit is expected to decline and, in parallel, the debt-to-GDP ratio to shift to a downward path. The current account surplus and the economy's net lending are expected to continue rising over the forecast horizon. The decline in Hungary's net external debt will continue. In order to ensure price stability, prevent second-round inflationary effects and anchor inflation expectations, the Monetary Council tightened monetary conditions further by several steps in its decision today. According to the July decision, the cycle of interest rate hike continues by 30 basis points. The central bank base rate rises to 1.20 percent. The Monetary Council also considers a 30 basis point increase in the interest rate corridor to be justified. The overnight deposit rate changes to 0.25 percent, and the overnight and one-week collateralised lending rates change to 2.15 percent. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at weekly tenders. According to the Monetary Council's assessment, is warranted to increase the interest rate on the one-week deposit instrument by the same amount as in the base rate. In parallel with the tightening of interest rate conditions, the Monetary Council continues to phase out the instruments having an effect at longer maturities. With the exhaustion of the available amount, the MNB announced the termination of the FGS Go! in June. As a next step, from today the Bank will discontinue the use of the long-term collateralised lending facility. The Monetary Council continues to consider the government securities purchase programme to be crucial in its set of monetary policy instruments, which it assesses to be successful during the third wave of the pandemic and in a volatile international financial market environment. Purchases by the Bank have contributed to maintaining a stable liquidity position in the government securities market and improved the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. The MNB will continue to use the programme by maintaining a lasting presence in the market, taking a flexible approach to changing the quantity and structure of weekly securities purchases, to the extent and for the time necessary. Through an active market presence, the MNB cushioned the spillover of end-of-quarter tensions in international swap markets to the domestic market, thereby contributing to preserving the stability of monetary conditions and through this to maintaining price stability. It is a key priority for the Bank that short-term rates in every sub-market and at all times should develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. The Monetary Council is committed to maintaining price stability. In the decision-makers' assessment, risks to the inflation outlook remain on the upside. The Council considers it justified to continue the cycle of interest rate hikes by taking firm steps on a monthly basis to ensure price stability, avoid second-round inflationary effects and to anchor inflation expectations. The Monetary Council will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes until the outlook for inflation stabilises around the central bank target and inflation risks become evenly balanced on the horizon of monetary policy."
Nigeria,2021-07-27,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 137 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON MONDAY 26th AND TUESDAY 27th JULY, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 26th and 27th July, 2021 faced with cautious optimism for the recovery of both the global and domestic economies. The performance of the global economy in the first two quarters of the year had been favourable and is expected to continue for the rest of the year. There is, however, renewed downside risk to this optimism associated with the fast spread of new and deadlier strains of the COVID-19 virus. The high rate of vaccination across the globe seems promising to drive herd immunity to reduce mortality rates. In the domestic economy, the continued support by both the monetary and fiscal authorities, is expected to yield favourable outcomes and hopefully return the economy to a strong recovery path in the next few quarters. The Committee reviewed the developments in the global and domestic economic and financial environments over the second quarter of 2021 and the outlook for the rest of the year. Nine members of the Committee were in attendance at this meeting. Global Economic Developments The Committee noted that while there has been reasonable gains in subduing the Pandemic, lowering of restrictions and reopening of several economies, the fast pace of mutation of new and deadlier strains of the virus is posing a downside risk to the full recovery of the global economy. In addition, the uneven access of vaccines across several countries is a significant risk to the attainment of global herd immunity. Despite the above challenges, governments all over the world have continued to ease restrictions to enable the recovery of supply chain networks and enhance aggregate demand. The 1 expected rebound in global output growth is dependent, therefore, on the efficient deployment of COVID-19 vaccines with the expectations that the evolving deadlier strains would be subdued. Even with the current outlook, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects global growth at 60 per cent in 2021, compared with the last projection of 55 per cent. In line with this, the Advanced Economies are projected to grow at 51 per cent while the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies are projected to grow at 67 per cent. Price development across several economies is expected to remain moderate in the short to medium term with some prospects of a mild uptick. The Committee further noted the rise in inflation above the long run objectives of some key Advanced Economies, although reported as transient and therefore not expected to lead to an adjustment of the stance of monetary policy. There however, remains the lingering risk of an early return to monetary policy normalization, should price development continue to trend upwards. Across several Emerging Market and Developing Economies, inflationary trend was on average mixed, with some of the economies recording higher rates, compared with their peers. This was largely due to exchange rate pressures, capital flow reversals, high energy costs, weak supply chains and poor response to policy stimulus to combat the macroeconomic slowdown associated with the Pandemic. In the global financial markets, the Committee noted the increased demand for equity securities, an indication of improved investor confidence in the global recovery. In addition, it observed the progressive weakening of long-term sovereign bond yields, as the demand for equities pick up. The MPC further noted the moderation in the price of gold, signaling reduced demand, as investors return to the financial markets. The unprecedented stimulus provided by monetary and fiscal authorities to ease the impact of the Pandemic has, however, heightened the risks of global financial crisis post-Pandemic and calls for central banks across the globe to remain vigilant, should the need for sudden policy adjustments arise. Domestic Economic Developments Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 051 per cent in the first quarter of 2021, compared with 011 per cent in the preceding quarter. In the non-oil sector. Agriculture and Industry sub-sectors, were the major drivers of growth, with growth rates of 228 and 094 per cent, respectively. The oil sector, year-on year, contracted by -221 per cent in first quarter of 2021, compared with -1976 per cent in the previous quarter. The weak performance in the oil sector was attributed to several factors, including the declining quality of oil infrastructure, lack of new investment in the sector and the need to comply with the OPEC+ production quota. The Committee noted that the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), improved to 466 index points in July 2021, compared with 455 index points in June 2021. Though it remained below the 50-index point mark, the improvement is an indication of gradual recovery of output growth in the economy. The Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) also increased to 448 index points in July 2021, compared with 430 index points in June 2021. The employment level index for July 2021 stood at 465 index points, relative to the preceding month's figure of 450, but, remained below the 500-index point threshold. The Committee welcomed the sustained monetary and fiscal stimulus to revamp the domestic economy and hoped that the distribution of vaccines to subdue the Pandemic will continue unabated. The Committee noted the continued moderation in headline inflation (year-on- year) to 1775 per cent in June 2021 from 1793 per cent in May 2021, the third consecutive month of decline. The decrease was attributed to a marginal decline in both the food and core components to 2172 and 1309 per cent in June 2021 from 2228 and 1315 per cent in May 2021, respectively. The MPC noted that, though, headline inflation remained well above the ceiling of the 3 Central Bank's 6-9 per cent corridor, it expressed optimism that the current interventions by the Bank in various sectors of the economy will further depress inflationary pressure as output growth improves and the negative output gap closes. On the performance of monetary aggregates, the Committee noted that broad money supply (M3) declined to 202 per cent in June 2021, compared with 299 per cent in May 2021. This development was largely driven by a slowdown in the growth rate of Net Domestic Assets (NDA) and Net Foreign Assets (NFA). Net Foreign Assets contracted by 365 per cent due to the contraction of foreign asset holdings of the central bank, as well as non-interest, primary mortgage, and microfinance banks. The marginal decline in Net Domestic Assets reflected the slowdown in aggregate credit net, which decreased to 430 per cent in June 2021, from 479 per cent in May 2021. Accordingly aggregate credit at end-May 2021 stood at N2423 trillion, compared with N2268 trillion at end-December 2020. This represents a year-to- date increase of N155 trillion. Under the Bank's development finance initiatives, the Bank granted N75651 billion to 3,,734,,938 small holder farmers cultivating 46 million hectares of land, of which N12024 billion was extended for the 2021 Wet Season to 627,,051 farmers for 847,,484 hectares of land, under the Anchor Borrowers' Programme (ABP); for the Agribusiness/Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS), the sum of N12157 billion was disbursed to 32,,617 beneficiaries; and for the Targeted Credit Facility (TCF). N31817 billion was released to 679,,422 beneficiaries, comprising 572,,189 households and 107,,233 Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs). Under the National Youth Investment Fund (NYIF), the Bank released N30 billion to 7,,057 beneficiaries, of which 4,,411 were individuals and 2,,646 SMEs. Under the Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI). N322 billion was disbursed to 356 4 beneficiaries across movie production, movie distribution, software development, fashion, and IT verticals. Under the N10 trillion Real Sector Facility, the Bank released N92341 billion to 251 real sector projects, of which 87 were in light manufacturing, 40 in agro- based industry, 32 in services and 11 in mining. On the N100 billion Healthcare Sector Intervention Facility (HSIF). N9841 billion was disbursed for 103 health care projects, of which, 26 are pharmaceuticals and 77 are in the hospital services. Similarly the sum of N23254 million was disbursed to 5 beneficiaries under the CBN Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention (Grant) Scheme (HSRDIS) for the development of testing kits and devices for Covid-19 and Lassa Fever. On the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP). N3604 billion was disbursed to 17 Meter Asset Providers, to nine DisCos, for the procurement and installation of 657,,562 electricity meters. On the Nigerian Electricity Market Stabilization Facility - 2 (NEMSF-2), the CBN released N12029 billion to 11 DisCos, to provide liquidity support and stimulate critical infrastructure investment needed to improve service delivery and collection efficiency. On money market development, the net liquidity position and interest rates in the economy reflected the impact of the Bank's liquidity management operations. Accordingly the monthly weighted average Inter-bank Call and Open Buy Back (OBB) rates rose to 1687 and 1639 per cent in June 2021 from 1595 and 1618 per cent in May 2021, respectively. The Committee noted the weak performance of the equities market despite the recent increasing patronage by domestic investors. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) decreased by 130 per cent to N1977 trillion on July 16, 2021, from N2003 trillion on May 31, 2021. The MPC noted that the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and the Liquidity Ratio (LR) both remained above their prudential limits at 155 and 413 per cent, 5 respectively. The Non-Performing Loans ratio (NPLs) at 570 per cent in June 2021 showed progressive improvement, compared with 64 per cent in June 2020. The Committee, however, urged the Bank to sustain its tight prudential regime to bring Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) below the 50 per cent prudential benchmark. The Committee noted the marginal increase in the external reserves which rose to $3383 billion on 22nd July 2021 from US$3278 billion as at 30th June 2021. Outlook The overall outlook for both the global and domestic economies, remain clouded with downside risks despite the upbeat forecast for a speedy recovery. These risks include lingering uncertainties surrounding the path to the termination of the Pandemic, as new and deadlier strains of the virus continue to pose a significant threat to the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, the uneven access to the vaccines across the globe is undermining the realization of the current forecast. Capital flows to emerging market economies, remain uncertain as the pace of price development in the advanced economies pick up. While the US Federal Reserve Bank and other major central banks have given indications that the current rise in inflation is transitory, and may not require policy adjustment, inflation is confronted with a significant upside risk. This may result in an early return to monetary policy normalization, with adverse consequences for financial system stability. Available data and forecasts for key macroeconomic variables for the Nigerian economy suggest a broad improvement for the rest of the year. This is hinged on continued progress with the containment of the Pandemic, as well as ongoing monetary and fiscal support. As a result, the Nigerian economy is forecast to grow in 2021 by 315 per cent (CBN), 30 per cent (FGN) and 25 per cent (IMF). The Committee's Considerations The Committee noted the gradual recovery in output growth following positive growth in the first quarter and improving PMI in subsequent months, expressing confidence that the second quarter output result will show further improvement. The MPC carefully accessed the options confronting it in the short to medium term, analysing the downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation. It commended the continued effort by both the monetary and fiscal authorities as well as public health agencies in stemming the Pandemic and its impact, thus, returning the economy to a path of recovery. While the economy has been gradually reopening. Members noted that the Pandemic was far from over and therefore continued to hinder the recovery. It thus, urged the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to intensify efforts towards procurement of more vaccines to ensure that herd immunity is achieved in Nigeria. The MPC was concerned about the broad level of insecurity across the country, noting its impact on business confidence and overall economic activities. It noted the persisting insecurity in key commodity producing areas and urged the Federal Government to intensify security surveillance in farming communities to ensure uninterrupted farming activities. Committee members expressed optimism about the likely moderating impact of the forthcoming harvests on food prices, as this would contribute to the ongoing broad reduction in headline inflation. The CBN will continue to release maize from its strategic maize reserve directly to feed-millers as part of its strategic response to address rising food prices and moderate the price of maize across the country. Members further noted the contribution of poor infrastructure to rising domestic price levels, re-iterating their call to the Federal Government to prioritize investment in public infrastructure such as improved transportation networks, power supply and telecommunication facilities. Funding for such projects, the 7 Committee noted, could be sourced through Public-Private-Partnerships, as well as the issuance of diaspora bonds. It emphasized the complementary role these bonds would play to boost foreign exchange supply, improving accretion to reserves and easing the exchange rate pressure. Notwithstanding the moderate decline in market indices, the Committee noted that the equities market remained in a good place, indicating sustained investor confidence in the Nigerian economy. The MPC applauded the continued resilience of the banking system in the face of severe shocks to both the domestic and global economies. Members noted Management's effort in maintaining a reasonably low level of non-performing loans ratio, even though aggregate credit moderated slightly. The Committee encourages Nigerian banks to extend more credit to consumers and firms to enhance consumption and production activities necessary to strengthen the recovery. Committee members noted the persistent reduction in remittance of oil revenue to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, stemming largely from rising levels of cost under-recovery and other obligations, particularly to Joint Venture Contracts. The Committee thus, urged the Government to continue to explore additional sources of non-oil revenue, as this would reduce the over dependence on a single revenue source. Members applauded the efforts by the Federal Government to encourage the use of gas in motor vehicles and the payment for conversion of 1 million Premium Motor Spirit (PMS)-driven vehicles to gas-driven, to reduce overall cost of PMS consumption. The Committee encouraged the participation of private sector initiatives to develop and expand modular refineries while it frowns at cross-border smuggling of PMS. The Committee also noted the increased contribution of the non-oil sector to Government revenue in recent times which reflected the gradual diversification 8 of the economy and reduce reliance on crude oil export proceeds and called for increased support for the non-oil sector in the country. Overall Members were confident that the Bank was taking the right steps toward the restoration of macroeconomic stability, while noting the downside risks to growth and the upside risks to price developments. The Committee's Decision At this meeting, the MPC was delighted that inflation had begun to trend downwards, while output growth had remained positive. Committee however, was of the opinion that there was a need to continue to put in place policy measures that will further and faster drive down inflation, while at the same time accelerate output growth to levels above population growth rate. Whereas the arsenal at its disposal had almost become fully exhausted. MPC believe that there is the need to continue to use those tools that had been adopted so far, even in a more aggressive manner. MPC therefore, encourage the Bank to continue using its existing administrative methods to rein-in inflation by the use of its discretionary CRR policy to mop-up liquidity from the banking system as the need arises. The Committee also encouraged the Bank to continue the use of its intervention mechanism to deploy funds to output-stimulating and employment-generating sectors of the economy, such as, the Targeted Credit Facility. AGSMEIS. Agriculture and Manufacturing. In the Committee's view, the current situation, neither gives room for tightening, as this will hurt output growth, nor, loosening, as this will exacerbate inflationary pressures. On tightening. MPC feels that whereas this will limit excess liquidity available to attack the foreign exchange market, it nevertheless feels that tightening will reduce money supply and thus, inhibits the ability of Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) to create credit that is needed to stimulate manufacturing output which could also help to moderate prices. On loosening, whereas MPC feels this should transmit into lower market interest rates which could improve the ability of obligors to repay their loans and reduce NPLs, it nevertheless feels loosening would not only exacerbate inflationary pressure, but this would increase negative real rate of return and discourage investments in the domestic economy. Based on the above considerations, the MPC made the decision to hold all policy parameters constant; believing that a hold stance will enable the continued permeation of current policy measures in supporting the recorded growth recovery and macro-economic stability. The Committee thus decided by a unanimous vote to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 115 per cent. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Retain the MPR at 115 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 275 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 27th July 2021 10."
Pakistan,2021-07-27,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement July 27, 2021. At its meeting on 27th July 2021, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the policy rate at percent. Since its last meeting in May, the MPC was encouraged by the continued domestic recovery and improved inflation outlook following the recent decline in food prices and core inflation. In addition, consumer and business confidence have risen to multi-year highs and inflation expectations have fallen. As result of these positive developments, growth is projected to rise from. percent in FY21 to percent this year, and average inflation to moderate to percent this year from its recent higher out-turns. Imports are expected to grow on the back of the domestic recovery and rebound in global commodity prices, albeit more moderately than in FY21. The MPC noted that the market-based flexible exchange rate system, resilience in remittances, an improving outlook for exports, and appropriate macroeconomic policy settings should help contain the current account deficit in sustainable range of percent of GDP in FY22. Notwithstanding this moderate current account deficit, the country's foreign exchange reserves position is expected to continue to improve this year due to adequate availability of external financing. Against this backdrop, the MPC felt that the uncertainty created by the on-going fourth Covid wave in Pakistan and the global spread of new variants warrants continued emphasis on supporting the recovery through accommodative monetary policy. Looking ahead, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the MPC expects monetary policy to remain accommodative in the near term, and any adjustments in the policy rate to be measured and gradual to achieve mildly positive real interest rates over time. If signs emerge of demand-led pressures on inflation or of vulnerabilities in the current account, the MPC noted that it would be prudent for monetary policy to begin to normalize through gradual reduction in the degree of accommodation. This would help ensure that inflation does not become entrenched at high level and financial conditions remain orderly, thereby supporting sustainable growth. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Real sector. Pakistan's economic recovery continues, driven by industryâparticularly large-scale manufacturing and constructionâand services. Several high-frequency indicators show strong year-on-year growth including fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sales, steel production, cement sales. POL sales, and electricity generation. The recent month-on-month deceleration witnessed in some indicators is mainly seasonal, and in the case of automobile sales was compounded by delayed bookings in anticipation of supportive measures in the FY22 budget. Notwithstanding the upswing in activity, capacity utilization in manufacturing is still below its peak levels during FY16-18 and services sector activity has not yet fully returned to normal due to intermittent mobility restrictions. In FY22, growth is expected to pick up further, supported by measures announced in the budget, accommodative monetary conditions, and disbursements under the SBP's TERF facility for investment and other refinance facilities. Key budgetary measures include increased development spending and reduced Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN regulatory duties, custom duties. FED and sales tax on the import of raw materials and capital goods. These measures will directly benefit construction and allied industries, as well as export-oriented industries. Agricultural growth is also expected to contribute favorably despite reported water shortages at the start of the sowing period of Kharif crops. The key downside risk to growth stems from the resurgence of Covid cases associated with new strains of the virus both globally and domestically, amid still-low vaccination rates. External sector. After recording surpluses in the initial months, the current account deficit widened in the second half of FY21, reflecting the pick-up in domestic activity as well as seasonality in import payments, higher global commodity prices, and vaccine imports. In addition, imports of capital goods rose, reflecting the improvement in the investment outlook of the economy. Largely in line with other emerging market currencies, the PKR has depreciated by around percent since the last MPC meeting, partly as expectations of normalization of monetary policy in the United States have been brought forward. For FY21 as whole, the MPC noted that Pakistan's external position was at its strongest in several years. In line with SBP projections in March 2021, the current account deficit fell to only. percent of GDP. This is the lowest current account deficit in 10 years, supported by all-time high exports and remittances. SBP's FX reserves rose by $5. billion during FY21 to end at over $17 billion or around months of imports, 4Â½ year high. Moreover SBP's net external reserve buffers (gross reserves less forward liabilities) have risen by $14. billion since the beginning of FY20. The MPC noted that there were good reasons to expect that, unlike several previous growth upturns in Pakistan, the current economic recovery would be accompanied by external stability. Given expected resilience in remittances and an improving outlook for exports, the current account deficit is expected to converge toward sustainable range of percent of GDP in FY22. This is much lower than in FY17 and FY18, when the current account deficit increased to around and percent of GDP, respectively, and FX reserves fell by $2 billion and $6. billion, respectively. Moreover imports this year are expected to be more skewed toward machinery rather than consumption compared to FY17, and machinery imports are projected to be better distributed across sectors than in FY18, when power and telecommunications dominated. With the contained current account deficit and healthy commercial, official, portfolio and FDI inflows. Pakistan's external financing needs of around $20 billion are expected to be more than fully met in FY22. As result, foreign exchange reserves are projected to rise further. Since September 2020, the SBP's Roshan Digital Account initiative for Overseas Pakistanis has generated new financial inflows of $1. billion. In July. Pakistan successfully raised an additional $1 billion through tap issuance of its Eurobond that fetched $2. billion in March. In August. Pakistan's reserve buffers are expected to rise by another $2. billion through the IMF's planned new global SDR allocation. In the event of an unforeseen shock, for instance higher-than- expected oil prices or capital flight from emerging markets due to tightening of financial conditions in advanced economies, the MPC noted that the market-based flexible exchange rate and improved outlook for domestic investment would help keep the balance of payments position sustainable. In addition, the MPC noted that if balance of payments pressures were to emerge, some normalization of monetary policy may also be needed, especially if demand-side pressures are at play. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Fiscal sector 10. The FY22 budget is expected to be broadly inflation-neutral as most tax rates have been left unchanged. The government expects the budget deficit to decline from. percent of GDP last year to. percent in FY22, on the back of strong growth in both tax (24. percent (y/y) and non-tax revenue (24. percent), mainly from income and sales tax as well as the petroleum development levy (PDL). This higher revenue is expected to offset significant growth in both development (71 percent for federal and provincial governments) and non-interest current expenditure (12. percent, mainly in the form of subsidies and grants). Meanwhile the government projects public debt to decline further from 87. percent of GDP in FY20 and 83. percent in FY21 to 81. percent in FY22. The MPC noted that it would be important to carefully monitor how fiscal out-turns evolve through the year, and their resulting implications for the growth and inflation outlook. Monetary and inflation outlook 1. The MPC noted that financial conditions remain appropriately accommodative, with market yields and benchmark rates broadly unchanged since the last MPC meeting. Private sector credit continues to recover primarily due to the low interest rate environment and SBP's support measures during Covid. In FY22, private sector credit is expected to grow broadly in line with nominal GDP and SBP stress-tests indicate that the banking sector should remain stable even under adverse scenarios, with system-wide NPLs contained and capital adequacy well above the domestic regulatory benchmark. Inflation fell from 1. percent (y/y) in April to. percent in June. For the first time since January, food prices fell on month-on-month basis in June, on the back of the government's administrative measures and imports of wheat and sugar. Despite the rise in global oil prices, downward adjustments in the PDL have helped limit domestic pass-through. Moreover core inflation also fell over the last two months in both urban and rural areas, confirming the view that the energy and food-driven inflation highlighted in recent monetary policy statements has not seeped into general prices and that inflation expectations are well-anchored. Average inflation in FY21 was. percent, in line with the SBP's forecast range announced in May 2020. This is the third consecutive year that inflation has fallen within or marginally below the projected range issued by the SBP around the beginning of the year, highlighting strong forecasting performance. In addition, this outcome underscores the key role that the SBP forecast range is increasingly playing in anchoring inflation expectations, thus allowing monetary policy to credibly look through temporary inflationary pressures. The recent decline in inflation is consistent with the MPC's view that recent price pressures are largely supply-driven and transient. Headline inflation should begin to dissipate more visibly in the second half of the year when the February electricity tariff increase drops out of the base, converging to the percent target range over the medium term. The key risk that could lower inflation is resurgence in the pandemic domestically and globally. Conversely risks that could raise inflation include higher-than-expected global commodity prices, especially if these are coupled with upward adjustments in the PDL or domestic energy tariffs, as well as fiscal slippages that lead to stronger demand-side pressures through the year. The MPC will continue to carefully monitor developments affecting medium-term prospects for inflation, financial stability and growth and will be prepared to respond appropriately, as and when required.

United States,2021-07-28,"EDT July 28, 2021 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have shown improvement but have not fully recovered. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remain. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT July 28, 2021track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C. Williams. Vice Chair; Thomas I Barkin; Raphael W Bostic; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H Clarida; Mary C Daly; Charles L Evans; Randal K. Quarles; and Christopher J Waller."
Colombia,2021-07-30,"Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). The decision was based on the following considerations. Banco de la Republica's board of directors (BDBR) in its meeting on July 30 voted by majority to hold the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%. The decision was based on the following considerations. Leading indicators suggest a return to the prevailing growth trajectory, following a recent slowdown in economic activity deriving from roadblocks and other disruptions to public order. As a result, the technical staff has revised its growth projection for 2021 upward from 6.5% to 7.5%. Nevertheless, the output gap remains in negative territory and excess productive capacity persists, as reflected in recent labor market figures, in the context of continued high levels of uncertainty. Inflation increased from below 2.0% in the first quarter to 3.3% in May and 3.63% in June, with price pressures coming from both internal and external sources. Nevertheless, inflation excluding food and regulated items continues at low levels (1.87% in June). Some inflationary pressures could prove persistent and have an effect on expected inflation, as the economy continues to recover and reduce excess capacity. Vaccination campaigns have helped push global recovery, especially in advanced economies. However, new variants of the coronavirus continue to pose a significant risk to the world economy. Inflationary pressures in the United States and other advanced economies suggest a risk of tightening international financial conditions. The technical staff projected that the current account deficit would increase from 3.4% of GDP in 2020 to 4.5% in 2021 and 4.3% in 2022. This would be in line with an expected recovery in domestic demand, driven in particular by household consumption and investment. A moderation of the current account deficit beginning in 2022 would be consistent with implementation of the fiscal reform package recently presented by the national government. Banco de la Republica's board members concurred that the space available to maintain current levels of monetary stimulus is closing, given recent inflation behavior and its possible persistence, as well as the upward revision to the growth forecast. In reviewing these circumstances and the general balance of risks, the BDBR made a majority decision to hold the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%. Five board members voted to hold the current rate, while two board members voted for a 25-basis point increase.

Brazil,2021-08-04,"In its 240th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate to 5.25% p.a. Regarding the global outlook, the evolution of the Covid-19 Delta variant adds risk to the recovery of the world economy. The Committee considers that, in spite of the recent movements in the yield curves, there is still a relevant upward inflation risk in the central economies. Nevertheless, the environment for emerging economies remains favorable with the long-lasting monetary stimuli, with the fiscal programs, and with the reopening of the major economies. Turning to the Brazilian economy, recent indicators continue evolving satisfactorily and do not call for relevant revisions in growth forecasts, which display a robust economic recovery during the second half of the year. Consumer inflation has been persistent. Recent indicators show a worse composition. Noteworthily, a surprise in the underlying services inflation and the continuing pressure on industrial goods, causing a rise in core measures. Furthermore, there is new pressure in volatile components, as the possible additional increase in electricity fares and food prices, both due to adverse weather conditions. Altogether, these factors imply significant revisions in short-term forecasts. The various measures of underlying inflation are above the range compatible with meeting the inflation target. Inflation expectations for 2021, 2022, and 2023 collected by the Focus survey are around 6.8%, 3.8%, and 3.25%, respectively; and. The Copom's inflation projections in its baseline scenario, with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and exchange rate starting at USD/BRL 5.15* and evolving according to the purchase power parity (PPP), stand around 6.5% for 2021, 3.5% for 2022 and 3.2% for 2023. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that rises to 7.0% in 2021, remains at this level during 2022 and drops to 6.5% during 2023. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 10.0% for 2021 and 4.6% for 2022 and 2023. The energy flag is assumed to be neutral, remaining at ""red level 1"" in December each year. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, a possible reversion, even if partial, of the recent increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency would produce a lower-than-projected inflation in the baseline scenario. On the other hand, further extensions of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that increase aggregate demand and deteriorate the fiscal path may pressure the country's risk premium. In spite of the recent improvement of debt sustainability indicators, the elevated fiscal risk creates an upward asymmetry in the balance of risks, i.e., in the direction of higher-than-expected paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The Committee reiterates that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 1.00 p.p. to 5.25% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2022 and, to a lesser extent, 2023. The adjustment also reflects the Committee's perception that the recent deterioration of inertial components of inflation, in a moment of reopening of the service sector, could result in an additional deterioration of inflation expectations. The Committee understands that, at this moment, the strategy of a quicker monetary adjustment is the most appropriate to guarantee the anchoring of inflation expectations. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment. At this moment, the Copom's baseline scenario and balance of risk indicate as appropriate a tightening cycle of the policy rate to a level above the neutral. For the next meeting, the Committee foresees another adjustment of the same magnitude. The Copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the achievement of the inflation target and will depend on the evolution of economic activity, on the balance of risks, and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Carolina de Assis Barros. Fabio Kanczuk. Fernanda Magalhaes Rumenos Guardado. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Georgia,2021-08-04,"04.08.2021 The National Bank of Georgia raises the monetary policy rate by 0.5 percentage points to 10.0 percent On August 4, 2021, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) decided to increase the refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage points. The monetary policy rate was set at 10.0 percent. High inflation has been a global challenge recently and price growth in July exceeded forecasts in many countries. Georgia's annual inflation came out unexpectedly high as well at 11.9 percent in July. The driving forces of high inflation are predominately one-off and independent from monetary policy. The major ones are the sharply increased prices of food and oil in international markets. In addition, international shipping costs have increased significantly, which also affects prices of imported goods. According to the July data, prices of imported products increased by 18.4 percent in July, which is significantly higher than the increase in prices of domestic products (7.2 percent). It is noteworthy that recently there has been some reduction in the prices of a number of food products in international markets, and if this trend persists it should positively affect the local markets as well after some period. Utility bills are notable among the one-off local factors, contributing 1.7 percentage points to annual inflation. In addition to the temporary factors mentioned above, domestic demand has significantly increased - economic growth was 12.7 percent in the first half of the year and for 2021 the growth projection was revised upwards to 8.5 percent. At the same time, while strong fiscal stimulus is maintained, the current level of lending growth is higher than desired. Based on the updated data, the short-term inflation forecast has increased considerably compared to the previous forecasts, and it is expected that inflation in 2021, other things being equal, on average will be higher than 9 percent. In order to ensure that recent price increases  even if driven by temporary factors  do not result in high inflation expectations becoming entrenched, the NBG will maintain contractionary policy for a protracted period of time and/or will tighten it further, if necessary. With such a policy and the expected fade-out of one-off exogenous factors, inflation is projected to decline in 2022 and gradually approach its medium-term target of 3 percent. External demand continues to grow. However, on aggregate  taking into account the tourism sector - it remains below the pre-pandemic levels. According to the preliminary data, exports of goods increased by 30 percent year-on-year in June and is 13 percent higher compared to June 2019. Revenues from international travelers increased 11 times year-on-year in June, however the decline is 64 percent compared to the same period in 2019. As for the imports of goods, an annual growth of 37 percent was recorded in June, whereas compared to June 2019 imports grew by 13 percent. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on September 15, 2021."
Thailand,2021-08-04,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 5/2021 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 4 August 2021 as follows. The Committee voted 4 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent. Two members voted to cut the policy rate by 025 percentage point. One MPC member was unable to attend the meeting. The Committee assessed that the Thai economy in 2021 would be affected by the COVID-19 outbreak more than expected with significant downside risks. The most important issue for the Thai economy at present was to accelerate containment of the outbreak and distribution of vaccines to restore confidence and support the recovery in economic activities and income. Fiscal and financial measures must be expedited to assist affected groups in a more targeted and timely manner in line with the current situation. The Committee viewed that risks to the economic outlook remained high. The support must be provided by accelerating the distribution of liquidity and reduce debt burden for those who were affected. Most members viewed that financial measures would be more effective than a further reduction in the policy rate which was already low. Most members thus voted to maintain the policy rate. Nevertheless two members voted to cut the policy rate to support other measures in shoring up the economy and mitigate heightened risks in the period ahead. The Thai economy was projected to expand 07 and 37 percent in 2021 and 2022 respectively. This would be lower than the previous projection due to private consumption which was greatly affected this year and foreign tourist figures which were expected to be significantly lower next year. The labor market would be more fragile, particularly the services sector and the self-employed. However the economy would be supported by higher public expenditure thanks to the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Additional Loans to Solve Economic and Social problems as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic. BE. 2564 (2021). The support would also come from the improving merchandise exports, although parts of the manufacturing sector were affected by the outbreak in factories and temporary shortages in raw material. Headline inflation would be largely unchanged, while medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target. Downside risks to the economic outlook remained significant from the possibility of the outbreak situation in Thailand and other countries becoming more severe. The Committee would closely monitor these risks which would affect private consumption as well as income and employment in addition to impacts on foreign tourist figures. Despite ample overall liquidity, the distribution of liquidity remained uneven due to increased credit risks, particularly among SMEs and households that were additionally impacted by the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Nonetheless the special loan facility for businesses 2 helped enhance credit access for SMEs. On exchange rates, the Thai baht relative to the US dollar depreciated more than regional currencies owing to domestic factors. The Committee would closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem. The Committee viewed that the government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery. Public health measures should aim at accelerating the procurement and distribution of effective vaccines to prevent the outbreak from being prolonged. Fiscal measures should help alleviate the adverse impacts and support the economy by more actively addressing vulnerabilities in the labor market and business sector in an adequate and timely manner. Monetary policy must contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions overall. Financial and credit measures should be adjusted quickly to enhance effectiveness in order to expedite the distribution of liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner and help reduce debt burden. These measures included the special loan facility, asset warehousing scheme, and other measures by specialized financial institutions (SFIs). In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers' long-term debt serviceability. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery. In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook, namely the distribution and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, the outbreak situation in Thailand and abroad, as well as the adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures. The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary."
Czech Republic,2021-08-05,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank increased the two-week repo rate by 25 basis points to 0.75%. At the same time, it increased the Lombard rate to 1.75% and kept the discount rate unchanged at 0.05%. Four members voted in favour of this decision, one member voted for increasing the two-week repo rate by 50 basis points and two members voted for leaving rates unchanged. Minister of Finance Alena SchillerovÃ¡ also attended the Bank Board meeting today. . The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. Consistent with the forecast is a rise in market interest rates from the middle of this year onwards. This is in response to increased price pressures from the foreign and domestic economies and to the risk of undesirable deviation of inflation expectations from the CNB's 2% target. The economies of our main trading partners will continue to grow in the second half of this year thanks to an easing of the anti-epidemic measures in spring and early summer. The overloading of global production and supply chains is expected to abate gradually. Recovering foreign economic activity and strong growth in prices of commodities, materials and components are reflected in currently elevated inflation pressures in the production sector. These will gradually subside in the second half of this year as commodity prices correct and demand switches partially back to services. Foreign consumer price inflation will exceed 2% this year. However, it will slow next year as some temporary inflationary factors dissipate. The monetary policy of the European Central Bank will stay very accommodative. The outlook for euro interest rates therefore remains negative. The Brent crude oil price outlook has shifted higher compared with the previous forecast in expectation of a more robust economic recovery after the pandemic. However, oil prices are expected to decline slightly from their current elevated levels. The euro-dollar exchange rate is little changed from the previous forecast and does not stray far from the current level over the next two years. The Czech economy is recovering from the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. A retreat of the pandemic led to most of the restrictions in wholesale, retail and services being lifted at the end of spring. The reopened businesses were thus able to catch their breath again. If the anti-epidemic measures were to be partially tightened for a time in the rest of summer or during the autumn due to a rise in new cases, it should no longer have tangible economic effects. This will be due to increasing vaccination coverage and effective new forms of medication, and also to the fact that the economy has learned to cope better with the coronavirus. Renewed economic growth will be driven by strongly recovering household consumption, aided, among other things, by the release of part of the forced savings created during lockdowns. Consumer sentiment will also be boosted by a gradual improvement in the labour market situation. The overloading of global supply chains, which is currently hindering the production and export performance of Czech industry, will weaken over the rest of this year. According to the CNB's new forecast, the Czech economy will thus grow by more than 3% overall this year. Next year, its growth will increase slightly further and the output of the economy will thus return to the pre-pandemic level. In 2023. GDP will return to its steady-state growth rate. Inflation will rise well above the upper boundary of the tolerance band around the 2% target in the quarters ahead. This will be due to an upswing in food price inflation coupled with continued high core inflation and strong fuel price inflation. This will later be joined by renewed administered price inflation. The currently strong overall inflation pressures will start to ease gradually at the end of this year. This will be due partly to a slowdown in the currently rapid growth in import prices. Domestic price pressures will continue to rise slightly for some time yet, mainly on the back of increased consumer demand and a gradual pick-up in wage growth. The latter will be supported by a further marked increase in the minimum wage at the start of next year. Next year, inflation will return towards the 2% target, aided by this year's tightening of monetary conditions. According to the forecast, the koruna will appreciate further, strengthening beyond CZK 25 to the euro in late 2021 and early 2022. This will primarily reflect a recovery in aggregate demand, the export of as yet unfinished products, and an inflow of foreign capital due to improved sentiment. A strengthening koruna will also be strongly fostered by a widening interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area due to a rise in domestic market rates. Consistent with the summer forecast is a rise in market interest rates from the middle of this year onwards. A monetary policy response is needed in view of the robust price pressures from the domestic economy and abroad. Inflation is being fostered by the improving condition of the domestic economy, brisk wage growth and high growth in foreign producer prices this year. At this stage, a gradual tightening of monetary conditions will not jeopardise the recovery of the Czech economy from the pandemic and will reinforce the confidence of Czech economic agents in long-term price stability in our country. By comparison with the previous forecast, the inflation outlook is higher for this year and the next. Economic growth this year has also been revised upwards, whereas its forecast for next year is little changed. The outlook for domestic interest rates in higher for both years. Compared with the previous forecast, the koruna will appreciate rather faster, especially next year."
Egypt,2021-08-05,"Press Release August 5th, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 825 percent, 925 percent, and 875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 875 percen. Annual headline urban inflation marginally increased to 49 percent in June 2021 from 48 percent in May 2021, reflecting an unfavorable base effect for the second consecutive mont. Annual inflation readings are expected to continue to be affected by unfavorable base effects in the near ter. The slight uptick in June 2021 was driven by the higher annual inflation of food items, which accelerated to 34 percent in June 2021 from 17 percent in May 2021, reflecting higher annual contribution of subsidized and core food item. Meanwhile annual nonfood inflation declined to 56 percent in June 2021 from 63 percent in May 2021, which is its lowest recorded level since June 201. On the other hand, annual core inflation increased to 38 percent in June 2021 from 34 percent in May 202. Real GDP growth is estimated to have recorded a preliminary figure of 28 percent in fiscal year 2020/21, compared to 36 percent in the previous fiscal year, reflecting the full year impact of the pandemic's outbreak and its related containment measures on economic activit. Additionally sectoral growth continued to pick up, as detailed data up to 2021 Q1 showed that it remains supported by the positive contributions of trade, construction, and communications, as well as natural gas extraction. Furthermore leading indicators point towards a sustained improvement across most sector. Meanwhile the unemployment rate registered 74 percent in 2021 Q1, compared to 72 percent in 2020 Q. Global economic activity continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, although growth remains uneven across regions, as the pace of vaccinations varies across countrie. Additionally prospects of global economic recovery remain contingent on the efficacy of vaccines and the ability of countries to contain the spread of the virus, in light of the emergence of newer variant. Global financial conditions are expected to remain accommodative and supportive of economic activity over the medium ter. International prices for oil have continued to increase driven by both supply and demand factor. In the meantime, international prices for food and some other commodities remain at multi-year highs despite their drop recentl. Against this background, the MPC decided that keeping policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 7 percent (Â±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandat.

India,2021-08-06,"Monetary Policy Statement, 2021-22 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) August 4-6, 2021 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (August 6, 2021) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Since the MPC's meeting during June 2-4, 2021 the pace of global recovery appears to be moderating with the resurgence of infections in several parts of the world, especially from the delta variant of the virus. In June and July, global purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) slipped from the highs scaled in May. The growing consensus is that the recovery is occurring on a diverging two-track mode. Countries that are ahead in vaccination and have been able to provide or maintain policy stimulus are rebounding strongly. Growth in other economies remains subdued and vulnerable to new waves of infections. There has been a slowing of momentum in global trade volumes in Q2:2021, with elevated shipping charges and logistics costs posing headwinds.2 3. There has been a considerable hardening of commodity prices, particularly of crude oil. The latest agreement within the Organisation of Petroleum Countries (OPEC) plus to raise oil production for a likely restoration of output to the pre- pandemic levels by September 2022 imparted transient softening to spot and future crude prices from the recent peak in early July. Headline inflation has ratcheted up in several advanced economies (AEs) as well as most emerging market economies (EMEs), prompting a few central banks in EMEs to tighten monetary policy. In contrast, sovereign bond yields have softened across AEs as markets seem to have acquiesced to the views of central banks that inflation is largely transitory. In EMEs, bond yields remain relatively high on inflation concerns and country-specific factors. In the foreign exchange market. EME currencies have depreciated in the wake of portfolio outflows since mid-June as risk appetite ebbed, while the US dollar has strengthened. Domestic Economy 4. On the domestic front, economic activity picked up pace in June-July as some states eased pandemic containment measures. As regards agriculture, the south- west monsoon regained intensity in mid-July after a lull; the cumulative rainfall up to August 1, 2021 was one per cent below the long-period average. The pace of sowing of kharif crops picked up in July along with some high frequency indicators of rural demand, notably tractor and fertiliser sales. Reflecting large base effects, industrial production expanded in double digits year-on-year (y-o-y) in May 2021 on top of the massive jump in April, but it was still 13.9 per cent below its May 2019 level. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) that had dropped into contraction to 48.1 in June for the first time in 11 months, rebounded well into expansion zone with a reading of 55.3 in July. High- frequency indicators  e-way bills; toll collections; electricity generation; air traffic; railway freight traffic; port cargo; steel consumption, cement production; import of capital goods; passenger vehicle sales; two wheeler sales posted strong growth in June/July, reflecting adaptations to COVID related protocols and easing of containment. Services PMI remained in contractionary zone due to COVID-19 related restrictions, though the pace eased to 45.4 in July from 41.2 in June 2021. Initial quarterly results of non-financial corporates for Q1:2021-22 show healthy growth in sales, wage growth and profitability led by information technology firms. Headline CPI inflation plateaued at 6.3 per cent in June after having risen by 207 basis points in May 2021. Food inflation increased in June primarily due to an uptick in inflation in edible oils, pulses, eggs, milk and prepared meals and a pick-up in vegetable prices. Fuel inflation moved into double digits during May-June 2021 as inflation in LPG, kerosene, and firewood and chips surged. After rising sharply to 6.6 per cent in May, core inflation moderated to 6.1 per cent in June, driven by softening of inflation in housing, health, transport and communication, recreation and amusement, footwear, pan, tobacco and other intoxicants (as the effects of the one- off post-lockdown taxes imposed a year ago waned), and personal care and effects (due to sharp reduction in inflation in gold). System liquidity remained ample, with average daily absorption under the LAF increasing from â¹5.7 lakh crore in June to â¹6.8 lakh crore in July and further to â¹8.5 lakh crore in August so far (up to August 4, 2021). Auctions for a cumulative amount of â¹40,000 crore in Q2:2021-22 so far under the secondary market government securities acquisition programme (G-SAP) evened liquidity across illiquid segments of the yield curve. Reserve money (adjusted for the first-round impact of the changes in the cash reserve ratio) expanded by 11.0 per cent y-o-y on July 30,3 2021 driven by currency demand. As on July 16, 2021, money supply (M3) and bank credit by commercial banks grew by 10.8 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively. India's foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 43.1 billion in 2021-22 (up to end-July) to US$ 620.1 billion. Outlook 8. Going forward, the revival of south-west monsoon and the pick-up in kharif sowing, buffered by adequate food stocks should help to control cereal price pressures. High frequency indicators suggest some softening of price pressures in edible oils and pulses in July in response to supply side interventions by the Government. Input prices are rising across manufacturing and services sectors, but weak demand and efforts towards cost cutting are tempering the pass-through to output prices. With crude oil prices at elevated levels, a calibrated reduction of the indirect tax component of pump prices by the Centre and states can help to substantially lessen cost pressures. Taking into consideration all these factors. CPI inflation is now projected at 5.7 per cent during 2021-22: 5.9 per cent in Q2; 5.3 per cent in Q3; and 5.8 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22, with risks broadly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2022-23 is projected at 5.1 per cent (Chart 1). Domestic economic activity is starting to recover with the ebbing of the second wave. Looking ahead, agricultural production and rural demand are expected to remain resilient. Urban demand is likely to mend with a lag as manufacturing and non-contact intensive services resume on a stronger pace, and the release of pent- up demand acquires a durable character with an accelerated pace of vaccination. Buoyant exports, the expected pick-up in government expenditure, including capital expenditure, and the recent economic package announced by the Government will provide further impetus to aggregate demand. Although investment demand is still anaemic, improving capacity utilisation and congenial monetary and financial conditions are preparing the ground for a long-awaited revival. Firms polled in the Reserve Bank surveys expect expansion in production volumes and new orders in Q2:2021-22, which is likely to sustain through Q4. Elevated levels of global commodity prices and financial market volatility are, however, the main downside risks. Taking all these factors into consideration, projection for real GDP growth is retained at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22 consisting of 21.4 per cent in Q1; 7.3 per cent in Q2; 6.3 per cent in Q3; and 6.1 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22. Inflationary pressures are being closely and continuously monitored. The MPC is conscious of its objective of anchoring inflation expectations. The outlook for aggregate demand is improving, but still weak and overcast by the pandemic. There is a large amount of slack in the economy, with output below its pre-pandemic level. The current assessment is that the inflationary pressures during Q1:2021-22 are largely driven by adverse supply shocks which are expected to be transitory. While the Government has taken certain steps to ease supply constraints, concerted efforts in this direction are necessary to restore supply-demand balance. The nascent and hesitant recovery needs to be nurtured through fiscal, monetary and sectoral policy levers. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID- 19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. All members of the MPC  Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma. Dr.Mridul K. Saggar. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das  unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent. All members, namely. Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Dr.Mridul K. Saggar. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das, except Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published on August 20, 2021. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during October 6 to 8, 2021. (Yogesh Dayal) Press Release: 2021-2022/644 Chief General Manager."
Romania,2021-08-06,"In its meeting of 6 August 2021, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual inflation rate continued to rise above the upper bound of the variation band of the target in June 2021, implicitly above the forecast, climbing to 3.94 percent from 3.75 percent in May and 3.05 percent in March 2021. The pick-up in Q2 owed almost entirely to the exogenous CPI components, similarly to the previous quarter. The main contribution was made by the hike in fuel prices amid higher oil prices, followed by the modest influences coming from the increase in the prices of fruit and vegetables, as well as from the rise in tobacco product prices. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate stopped its downward trend in 2021 Q2, a little earlier than anticipated, moving up to 2.9 percent in June from 2.8 percent in March 2021. Its evolution reflects the temporary effects of a substantial pick-up in consumer demand, especially in the service segment, overlapping those from supply-side disruptions and costs linked with the increase in the prices of some commodities and with the measures to prevent the coronavirus spread, alongside the influences of the upward adjustment of short-term inflation expectations. Average annual CPI inflation rate and average annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices climbed to 2.9 percent and 2.4 percent respectively, from 2.6 percent and 2.1 percent respectively in March 2021. The incoming statistical data confirm the continued recovery of economic activity in 2021 Q1 at a pace significantly faster than expected; real GDP lowered its decline in annual terms to only -0.2 percent from -1.4 percent in 2020 Q4, given a 2.9 percent quarterly growth, i.e. marginally more pronounced than previously estimated. The evolution implies an almost full recovery in this period of the sharp economic contraction in 2020 Q2, as well as the re-opening of the positive output gap in 2021 Q1, two quarters ahead of the May forecast. At the same time, domestic demand is confirmed to be the sole driver of the economic upturn, in the context of the strong re-acceleration of private consumption, but also with the contribution of a significantly faster increase in gross fixed capital formation. However, the negative contribution of net exports increased substantially, similarly to the previous estimates, following a swifter pick-up in the growth rate of imports of goods and services than in that of exports thereof, entailing also a more pronounced widening of the trade deficit compared to the same period of the previous year. Against this backdrop, but also in the wake of the notable worsening of the primary and secondary income balances  on the back of flows of reinvested earnings and, to a small extent, of net inflows of EU funds , the current account deficit in 2021 Q1 posted the largest widening in annual terms in the past 14 quarters. According to the recent developments in high-frequency indicators, the economy continued to increase in 2021 Q2, at a slower quarterly pace, yet faster than that anticipated in May, which  given the base effect associated with the contraction in the same year-ago period  implies an increase to a significant two-digit level in the annual GDP dynamics. In the first two months of Q2, particularly swift dynamics were reported by retail trade, trade in the motor vehicles and motorcycles segment, and especially market services to households, but also by construction and industrial output, including new orders in manufacturing. At the same time, the year-on-year advance in trade deficit posted a mild slowdown, as the significant pick-up in exports, amid the strong revival of European economies, outpaced that in imports of goods and services. However, the annual growth rate of current account deficit decelerated markedly, due, inter alia, to the primary and secondary income balances; the dynamics remained nevertheless above the average values seen in 2019 and 2020. Looking at the financial market, key interbank money market rates remained relatively flat in July, at nearly 4-year lows, while yields on government securities posted meagre increases or rose at a swifter pace in the first half of the month, before stabilising at the new levels. The average lending rate on new business extended its overall downtrend in June, falling to a very low value from a historical perspective. The EUR/RON exchange rate remained, however, quasi-stable in the first part of July, and subsequently experienced a gradual downward adjustment, mainly on the back of seasonally-driven domestic developments. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector continued to pick up in June, reaching 11.2 percent, from 10.1 percent in May, as a result of stronger lending in the local currency, including due to the higher contribution of government programmes. Hence, the annual dynamics of the leu-denominated component advanced to 16.6 percent, against 15.4 percent in May, with its share in the loan stock widening to 71.1 percent in June. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the August 2021 Inflation Report, which incorporates the latest available data and information. The current scenario shows a higher path of the projected annual inflation rate over the next two years, with the indicator being again revised considerably upwards in the short term and to a lower extent in the latter part of the projection horizon. Specifically, the substantial hikes in energy prices  natural gas, electricity and fuels  in July, with a cumulative contribution of about 1 percentage point to the annual CPI dynamics, pushes the annual inflation rate in 2021 H2 above the previously anticipated levels, above the variation band around the target, which is likely to boost and extend the transitory inflationary impact of supply-side factors. At the same time, following the downward corrections in early 2022 driven by base effects, the annual inflation rate is expected to fall and to remain marginally below the upper bound of the band, above the values projected in May 2021, amid the increase to relatively higher levels in the aggregate demand surplus that re-opened earlier than expected in 2021 Q1. However, the evolution of the pandemic and the related containment measures pose heftier uncertainties and risks to the current forecasts, at least in the short run, given the resumed growth in domestic infections and the marked slowdown in the pace of vaccination, as well as signs of a new pandemic wave in Europe and elsewhere, amid the spread of a more contagious coronavirus variant (Delta). Sources of uncertainties and risks also remain the fiscal policy stance and the absorption of European funds, especially those under the Next Generation EU programme. Important from this perspective are the coordinates of the upcoming budget revision and the budget consolidation strategy presumed to be prepared by this autumn, in line with European institutions' recommendations, as well as the approval by the EC of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan. Fiscal/budgetary consolidation is vital for economic stability, for mitigating the impact of inflationary shocks. On the labour market, developments continued to improve, also compared to expectations, but uncertainties persist about the near-term outlook for the epidemiological situation and the implications of ceasing government support schemes. However, risks stem also from the synchronised uptrends in many commodity prices, likely to accelerate global inflation. In the meeting held today, 6 August 2021, based on the currently available data and assessments, and in light of the elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 1.25 percent per annum, while preserving tight control over money market liquidity; moreover, it decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 0.75 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 1.75 percent per annum. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to preserve price stability over the medium term in line with the 2.5 percent Â±1 percentage point flat inflation target, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth in the context of the fiscal consolidation process, while safeguarding financial stability. The NBR closely monitors developments in the domestic and international environment and stands ready to use the tools at its disposal to achieve the fundamental objective of price stability in the medium term. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 9 August 2021 at 11:00 a.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 16 August 2021 at 3:00 p.m. In line with the calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 5 October 2021."
Philippines,2021-08-11,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility at 2.0 percent. The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were likewise kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. Latest inflation forecasts have shifted marginally higher, reflecting the recent increase in global commodity prices and the depreciation of the peso. Average inflation is seen to settle slightly above the upper end of the target band of 2-4 percent in 2021. With the continued and timely implementation of non-monetary initiatives and reforms to mitigate supply-side pressures on meat and other food prices, inflation is projected to ease towards the midpoint of the target range in 2022 and 2023. Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain firmly aligned with the baseline projection path. At the same time, the risks to the inflation outlook remain broadly balanced over the policy horizon. The uptick in international commodity prices due to improving global demand amid lingering supply-chain bottlenecks could lend upside pressures to inflation. However, downside risks to the inflation outlook are also seen from the spread of more contagious coronavirus variants. In particular, delays in the lifting of containment measures could further dampen prospects for global growth and domestic demand. The Monetary Board also observed that the reimposition of quarantine measures to arrest the recent wave of COVID-19 infections could pose a risk to the ongoing economic recovery. To this end, targeted fiscal and health interventions, especially the acceleration of the Government's vaccination program, will be crucial in safeguarding public health and preventing deeper negative effects on the Philippine economy. On balance, the Monetary Board is of the view that the expected path of inflation and downside risks to domestic economic growth warrant keeping monetary policy settings unchanged. The Monetary Board remains keen on sustaining monetary policy support for as long as necessary in order for the momentum of economic recovery to gain more traction as well as to help boost domestic demand and market confidence, especially as risk aversion continues to temper credit activity. Going forward, the BSP will remain vigilant against any emerging risks to the outlook for inflation and growth. The BSP stands ready to adjust its policy settings as needed to ensure price and financial stability conducive to a sustainable economic recovery."
Mexico,2021-08-12,"The central banks of advanced economies have maintained the monetary stimulus -although in some cases they are already expecting to diminish it- while in emerging economies several of them have reduce it. Among key global risks are those associated with the pandemic and inflationary pressures, as well as with monetary and financial conditions. Domestic financial markets have exhibited exchange rate stability and interest rate increases, particularly for shorter terms. The recovery of the Mexican economy continued during the second quarter and is expected to endure for the rest of the year, while risks related to the growing number of infections persist. Although the pandemic has complicated the assessment of the economy, slack conditions are anticipated, with significant differences across sectors. Global inflation along with adverse effects on supply chains and productive processes of several goods and services generated pressures on headline and core inflation, which in July registered annual rates of 5.81% and 4.66%, respectively. Headline and core inflation expectations for 2021 increased again and those for the medium and long terms remained relatively stable at levels above the target. The revised forecasts for headline and core inflation are above those published in the last Quarterly Report (see table). Considering the nature of the shocks that have affected them, the larger increases correspond to the short term. Annual headline and core inflation projections are expected to decrease, particularly for horizons of one year and beyond, and to converge to the 3% target during the first quarter of 2023. These forecasts are subject to risks and additional shocks. On the upside: external inflationary pressures; cost-related pressures; core inflation persistence; exchange rate depreciation; and increases in agricultural and livestock product prices. On the downside: effects stemming from the negative output gap; additional social distancing; and exchange rate appreciation. The balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon is biased to the upside. Although the shocks that have increased inflation are expected to be transitory, due to their variety, magnitude, and the extended horizon over which they have affected it, they may pose risks to the price formation process. For this reason, it was deemed necessary to strengthen the monetary policy stance in order to avoid adverse effects on inflation expectations and enable an orderly adjustment of relative prices and the convergence of inflation to the 3% target. The Governing Board decided to increase the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.5%. For the next monetary policy decisions, the Governing Board will assess the factors that have an incidence on inflation, on its foreseen trajectory within the forecast horizon, and on its expectations. This, 1 in order for the policy rate to be consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates, and enable an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets. Voting in favor of the decision were Alejandro DÃ­az de LeÃ³n. Irene Espinosa, and Jonathan Heath. Voting in favor of leaving the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 4.25% were Galia Borja and Gerardo Esquivel. 2/ Forecasts as of May 2021.

Peru,2021-08-12,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT AUGUST 2021 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 0.50% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue with an expansionary monetary policy, setting the reference interest rate at 0.50 percent. Thus, the real interest rate of monetary policy is maintained at negative levels and historical lows. This decision takes into account the following developments: The year-on-year inflation rate increased from 3.25 percent in June to 3.81 percent in July being temporarily above the target range due to factors such as the increase in international prices of food and fuel, as well as the exchange rate. Trend inflation remains around the center of the target range. Year-on- year core inflation was 2.14 percent in July. Inflation is expected to return to the target range in the next twelve months and remain within that range for the rest of next year, due to the reversal of the effects of transitory factors on the inflation rate (exchange rate, fuel and grain prices in international markets) and that economic activity will remain below its potential level. One-year-ahead expected inflation increased from 2.6 percent in June to 3.0 in July, upper limit of the inflation target range. Most leading indicators and expectations about the economy remain pessimistic in July. Global economic recovery is expected to be more pronounced in the next quarters, as the vaccination process continues around the world, and significant stimulus packages are implemented in developed countries. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain an expansionary stance as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist and is especially attentive to new information referring to inflation expectations and the evolution of economic activity to consider, if necessary, changes in the monetary policy position. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows. Financial markets were highly volatile in a context of uncertainty and the BCRP's actions were intended to mitigate this volatility The Board also decided to raise the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 0.35 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 1.0 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on September 9, 2021."
Turkiye,2021-08-12,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 19 percent. Worldwide speeding up of vaccination rollout, especially in developed countries, supports the global economic recovery. Nonetheless, economies advancing in their vaccination programs exhibit a stronger performance in economic activity by easing the restrictions. Strong recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. Unfavorable effects of weather conditions in major agricultural commodity exporting countries are observed on global food prices. The effects of rising global inflation and inflation expectations on international financial markets remain significant. Leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong in the third quarter, with the help of robust external demand. The acceleration of domestic vaccination rollout facilitates the recovery in services and tourism sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. Commercial loan growth exhibits a mild course. The Committee monitors the adequacy of the implemented macroprudential measures to curb personal loan growth, which recently displayed a rise due to the reopening and deferred demand. Favorable external demand conditions and current tight monetary policy impact the current account balance positively. The current account is expected to post a surplus in the rest of the year due to the strong upward trend in exports, and the strong progress in the vaccination program stimulating tourism activities. The improvement in the current account balance is important for the price stability objective. In addition to the recent increases in import prices and administered prices, demand conditions, supply constraints in some sectors, possible volatility in inflation during the summer due to the reopening, and high levels of inflation expectations continue to pose risks to the pricing behavior and inflation outlook. The increase in inflation in July was driven by the rise in food inflation, due to supply-side effects in some products led by climate conditions, the high levels of international agricultural commodity and food prices, as well as the effects of the reopening. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is being observed. Taking into account the high levels of inflation and inflation expectations, the current tight monetary policy stance will be maintained decisively until the significant fall in the Inflation Report's forecast path is achieved. Accordingly, the MPC has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The policy rate will continue to be determined at a level above inflation to maintain a strong disinflationary effect until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is reached. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and perpetual decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2021-08-23,"The various indicators regarding the period prior to the recent worsening of morbidity showed thatthe level of activity had returned to its long-term trend in most industries, but activity was still below the trend in the vulnerable in-person industries. v GDP grew in the second quarter by a high annualized rate of 15.4 percent. In addition, the Central Bureau of Statistics revised historical GDP data upward. This combination led to an output gap in the second quarter of about 3 percent, lower than the previous assessment, which was 4.5 percent. v Labor market data continue to return toward their precrisis levels. The number of job vacancies continued to increase, continuing to the trend since the beginning of the year, and the employee hiring constraint reported by firms continues to weigh on the expansion of activity. However, the ratio of unemployed persons to the number of job vacancies varies markedly among the geographic regions in Israel v The upward trend of inflation continues. Inflation in the past 12 months is 1.9 percent. Inflation expectations for the coming year are within the target range, and declined slightly. Expectations derived from the capital market, and those of inflation contracts, are at the midpoint of the target range, while those of inflation forecasters are lower. Medium- and long-term inflation expectations from the capital markets remained anchored at the midpoint of the target range. v Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 0.6 percent against the US dollar, by 1.5 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate, and by 2.2 percent against the euro. v Home prices increased rapidly, by 7.6 percent, in the past 12 months. Alongside this, the pace of rental price increases remained relatively moderate. The Israeli economy's process of recovery from the crisis continues. However, there are still challenges to economic activity in view of the increased health risks in Israel and abroad. The Committee will therefore continue to conduct a very accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time, using a range of tools as necessary, includingthe interest rate tool, in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy targets and the recovery of the economy from the crisis, and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. For the fileof figures accompanying this notice, click here. Since the previous monetary policy decision, there has been a significant increase in morbidity due to the spread of the 'Delta variant' of the COVID-19 virus. In particular, there has been an increase in the number of seriously ill patients. These have led to government decisions to tighten limitations placed on economic activity: 'Green Badge' and 'Purple Badge' regulations have been reimposed in most industries, and the restrictions on those returning from abroad have been tightened. Alongside this, the third vaccination process is underway. The vaccination process is expected to help lower serious morbidity, and thereby lead to a reduction in the expected impact on the economy. However, the increase in morbidity, the pace of decline in the effect of the vaccination, and the ramifications thereof, have added a large measure of uncertainty regarding economic activity in the short and medium terms. Most of the recently published data reflect the accelerated economic recovery prior to the significant worsening of morbidity. The indicators regarding activity continue to show that the level of activity had returned to its long-term trend in most industries, but was lower than the trend in the vulnerable in-person industries, particularly tourism, hospitality, and culture. The average of credit card purchases in July-August was around the long-term trend (Figure 6), but the level of purchases in the tourism and restaurant industries is low (Figure 7). According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, the aggregatenet balance of the business sector continued to increase in July, and was at its highest level since the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis (Figure 4). Goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds, in dollars) are higher than they were prior to the crisis, and services exports continue to increase very rapidly. Total capital raised by private companies in the high-tech sector since the beginning of the year has already surpassed $15 billion, compared with about $10 billion in all of 2020 (Figure 22). Goods imports are high in all components. According to the first estimate of National Accounts data for the second quarter. GDP grew by a high annual rate of about 15.4 percent (Figure 1). Private consumption grew sharply by 36.3 percent, exports (excluding diamonds and startups) increased by 14 percent, and investment increased by 9.3 percent due to increases in industrial investment and in residential construction investment. The sharp increase in uses is also reflected in imports (excluding defense, ships and aircraft, and diamonds), which grew by 17.6 percent (Figure 2). In addition, first quarter growth was revised upward. In addition, according to a Central Bureau of Statistics revision of historical GDP data, nominal GDP in 2020 was about one percent higher than previous publications stated, and the historical growth rates prior to the crisis, from which the potential growth rate is derived, were higher than previous assessments. Even so, according to an analysis by the Bank of Israel Research Department, the combination of these corrections leads to an output gap of about 3 percent in the second quarterof 2021, lower than the previous assessment of 4.5 percent (Figure 3). Labor market data are continuing their trend of return to the precrisis situation. Labor Force Survey data for July indicate a decline in the broad unemployment rate to a monthly averageof 8.4 percent, and even lower in the second half of the month. (Figure 10). Since the exit from the third lockdown, there has also been an increase in the adjusted employment rate (according to which COVID-19 absentees are not considered employed; ages 15+), to 58.4 percent in July, while in 2019, prior to the crisis, the rate was about 61 percent (Figure 11). The numberof employed persons aged 15+ in July was about 185,000 lower than the number of employees required to attain the 2019 average employment rate. The number of job vacancies continued to increase, further to the trend since the beginning of the year (Figure 12), and according to the Business Tendency Survey, the employee hiring constraint continues to weigh on the expansion of activity, particularly in the hotels, manufacturing (professional employees), and services industries (Figure 14). However, the ratio of unemployed persons to the number of job vacancies varies markedly among the geographic regions in Israel (Figure 13). The upward trend in inflation continued. The CPI increased by 0.4 percent in July, and inflation in the past 12 months is 1.9 percent (1.7 percent net of energy and fruits and vegetables; Figure 17). Inflation in the nontradable components continues to increase, ledby items that were impacted by the opening of the economy. The increase in the prices of tradable goods was stable (Figure 18). The price increases encompass a greater number of components in the CPI. Inflation expectationsfor the coming year are within the target range, and declined slightly. Expectations derived from the capital market and from inflation contracts are at the midpoint of the target range, while those of professional forecasters are lower (Figure 19). Medium- and long-term expectations remain anchored at the midpoint of the target range (Figure 20). The Monetary Committee is closely following these developments, and its assessment is that there is no concern of an inflationary outbreak. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 0.6 percent against the US dollar, by 1.5 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate, and by 2.2 percent againstthe euro (Figure 21). Home prices increased by 7.6 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 26), a more rapid pace than in previous years, in view of the moderation in the number of building starts and in the number of building completions in the past year. The increase in housing prices in recent months has been accompanied by an increase in the prices of construction inputs. Total transactions in May remained high. In the past year, investors sold dwellings at a volume similar to their purchases, after having been net sellers in previous years. The volume of new mortgages taken out in July was similar to the record set in June, further to the high mortgage volumes since the beginning of the year (Figure 27). In the capital market, the Tel Aviv 125 index increased slightly relative to parallel indices abroad, and corporate bond spreads increased slightly but remained very low (Figure 25). Government bond yields declined slightly, mainly in the long portions, similar to the global trend. The credit market continues to function well, with stable and low interest rates (Figures 29 and 30). According to the CentralBureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, reported financing difficulties among businesses of various sizes are returning to levels similar to those that were prevalent prior to the crisis (Figure 28). The recovery in the global economy continues, but there is growing concern that the 'Delta variant' will lead to an increase in morbidity and a return of restrictions, and will thereby lead to a slowdown in activity and deepening difficulties in the global production chain. GDP data for the second quarter indicated continued global recovery,led by the advanced blocs, chiefly the United States. The IMF's global growth forecast for 2021 remained unchanged at 6 percent (Figure 31). However, according to the IMF, a significant spread of morbidity in the world will delete about 0.8 percent from global growth in both 2021 and 2022. The global purchasing managers indices for July continue to indicate economic expansion (Figure 33). The volume of world trade is at high levels of activity. Equity indices in the US and Europe continued to increase, while in contrast, equity indices in the emerging countries and in east Asia declined in view of the increase in morbidity, movement restrictions, and regulatory changes in China. Oil prices declined and commodity prices increased. Oil is trading at close to its precrisis price, but its price is still about 40 percent higher than it was 12 months, so that it is still expected to support inflation in the coming months. The global inflation environment continues to increase (Figure 34), but according to most assessments, a significant portion of the increase is not expected to persist (Figure 35). The US economy grew by 6.5 percent in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter in annualized terms. Sentiment data continue to indicate expansion, and July employment figures were better than expected. In the eurozone. GDP grew by about 8.2 percent in annual terms compared to the previous quarter, following two quarters of contraction. In China. GDP grew by about 5.3 percent in annual terms compared to the previous quarter: lower than the average in the precrisis years. In addition,activity data indicate a slowdown in the pace of activity. Monetary policy in the major economies remained very accommodative. The major central banks left their interest rates unchanged and did not change their purchase programs. However, the Fed emphasized progress in attaining the goals of the accommodative monetary policy, and it will consider the continuation of that policy at its coming meetings. Furthermore, there were interest rate increases in a number of developing economies in which there are significant inflationary pressures. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on September 6, 2021. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Thursday. October 7, 2021, followed by a press briefing by the Governor. v GDP grew in the second quarter by a high annualized rate of 15.4 percent. This combination led to an output gap in the second quarter of about 3 percent, lower than the previous assessment, which was 4.5 percent. v Labor market data continue to return toward their precrisis levels. However, the ratio of unemployed persons to the number of job vacancies varies markedly among the geographic regions in Israel. v The upward trend of inflation continues. Medium- and long-term inflation expectations from the capital markets remained anchored at the midpoint of the target range. v Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 0.6 percent against the US dollar, by 1.5 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate, and by 2.2 percent against the euro. v Home prices increased rapidly, by 7.6 percent, in the past 12 months."
Hungary,2021-08-24,"At its meeting on 24 August 2021, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 25 August 2021:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. Global economic recovery continued in the summer months. In parallel, global inflation also increased. In countries where the economy reopened sooner, inflation picked up earlier. International confidence indicators in manufacturing and services continued to suggest a positive outlook in July. However, the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic causes a renewed increase in the risks surrounding the recovery. International risk appetite was driven by the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, monetary policy messages of the world's leading central banks and macroeconomic data. Following a previous sustained rise, the prices of several important commodities have declined over the past month. Global oil prices fell overall in the period. The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank maintained loose monetary conditions and continued their asset purchase programmes. Nevertheless, based on the communication by the Federal Reserve's decision-makers, the possibility of phasing out the crisis management programmes arises more often. Meanwhile, central banks in some developed countries have already slowed the pace of their asset purchases. In the region, a number of central banks have recently indicated that they would stand ready to tighten monetary conditions, when necessary, due to the increase in the outlook for inflation. In August, the Czech central bank raised the base rate by an additional 25 basis points, while the central bank of Romania left the policy rate unchanged. The Hungarian economy has successfully restarted. In the second quarter of 2021, domestic GDP grew by 17.9 percent year-on-year, while it rose by 2.7 percent relative to the previous quarter, exceeding the level seen before the crisis. The pace of the economic recovery in Hungary is substantially better than the EU average. A wide range of sectors have contributed to the growth, but there are differences in the pace of recovery. In June, construction output approached, while industrial production already exceeded pre-crisis levels. Retail sales continue to fall short of their value preceding the pandemic. Real earnings, affecting mostly household consumption, rose further in May. Unemployment rate remained broadly unchanged in June and can still be considered low in international comparison. The historically high investment rate will continue to rise on the forecast horizon. Hungarian export performance is expected to improve markedly already in 2021 as external markets recover. The increase in the production of new export capacities built in previous years causes a dynamic expansion of exports over the entire forecast horizon. Household demand is likely to pick up gradually. Economic recovery in Hungary is one of the fastest compared with other European countries. In July 2021, annual inflation was 4.6 percent, while core inflation stood at 3.5 percent. The consumer price index declined by 0.7 percentage points relative to the previous month. The decline in inflation is mainly attributable to base effects. The price index of market services stopped rising in July, suggesting that the vast majority of repricings related to the reopening has already materialised. The consumer price index will temporarily rise again in autumn due to base effects. Therefore, the pace of the increase in prices is expected to remain above the central bank tolerance band until the end of the year. Thereafter, inflation is expected to fall back into the central bank tolerance band at the beginning of 2022 and to stabilise around the central bank target from mid-2022 as a result of the monetary policy tightening cycle. Increased commodity prices and a sustained rise in international freight costs point to a higher external inflation environment. Demand-supply frictions, emerging temporarily due to the rapid restart of the domestic economy, and the renewed tightening of labour market capacities expected in certain sectors, combined with dynamic wage growth, carry upside risks to inflation. Following 8.1 percent in 2020, from 2021 the government deficit is expected to decline and, in parallel, the debt-to-GDP ratio to shift to a downward path. The current account surplus and the economy's net lending are expected to continue rising over the forecast horizon. The decline in Hungary's net external debt will continue. In order to ensure price stability, prevent second-round inflationary effects and anchor inflation expectations, the Monetary Council tightened monetary conditions further in its decision today, continuing the interest rate hiking cycle started in June. According to the August decision, the central bank base rate rises by 30 basis points to 1.50 percent. The Monetary Council also considers a 30 basis point increase in the interest rate corridor to be justified: the overnight deposit rate increases to 0.55 percent, while the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates increase to 2.45 percent. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at weekly tenders. According to the Monetary Council's assessment, it is warranted to increase the interest rate on the one-week deposit instrument by the same measure as in the base rate. In parallel with the tightening of interest rate conditions, the Monetary Council continues to gradually phase out its crisis management instruments affecting longer maturities. Accordingly, with the exhaustion of the available amount, the MNB announced the termination of the FGS Go! in June 2021 and discontinued the use of the long-term collateralised lending facility from its July decision. In August, the Monetary Council performed another revision of its government securities purchase programme. During the pandemic, the government securities purchase programme successfully contributed to maintaining a stable liquidity position in the government securities market and strengthened the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission in a volatile international financial environment. At its meeting today, the Monetary Council decided to begin gradually withdrawing the government securities purchase programme while considering aspects of maintaining market stability. In the future, the Monetary Council will not set a revision limit applicable to the entire stock purchased under the programme. Instead, the Council will set a target amount for weekly purchases. As a first step, the MNB's purchases will decrease from a weekly amount of HUF 60 billion to HUF 50 billion from the week starting on 23 August 2021. The Bank may depart from this arrangement in a flexible manner, depending on the supply and other market conditions. Subsequently, the Monetary Council will perform a comprehensive assessment of the government securities purchase programme at the end of each quarter, starting in September 2021. As part of this, the Council will take a decision on the next step of the withdrawal, and it will set a target amount for weekly purchases over the next quarter. The MNB will start reducing purchases of shorter-term government securities. As a result, the share of longer-term government securities within weekly purchases will increase. The central bank will not sell the stock of government securities on its balance sheet, purchased government securities will be held to maturity. As it will be phased out gradually, the MNB will continue to use the programme taking a flexible approach to changing the quantity and structure of weekly purchases, to the extent and for the time necessary. In the Monetary Council's assessment, a stable liquidity position in the government securities market remains crucial from a monetary transmission perspective; therefore, the MNB will stand ready to temporarily raise the volume of weekly purchases at any given time to maintain market stability. At its June interest rate decision, the Monetary Council indicated that instruments supporting long-term sustainability will persistently remain part of the MNB's set of instruments, while crisis management tools are being withdrawn. In order to support sustainability, the MNB successfully launched its Green Mortgage Bond Purchase Programme. At its meeting today, the Monetary Council has increased the available amount under the Bond Funding for Growth by HUF 400 billion to HUF 1,550 billion. The Monetary Council is committed to maintaining price stability. In the decision-makers' assessment, the Hungarian economy has successfully restarted. In light of the September Inflation Report, the Monetary Council will perform a comprehensive assessment of the results achieved by the cycle of interest rate hikes, and will identify risks to the inflation outlook. The Monetary Council will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes until the outlook for inflation stabilises around the central bank target in a sustainable manner and inflation risks become evenly balanced on the horizon of monetary policy."
South Korea,2021-08-26,"The bank of korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 0.50% to 0.75%. Currently available information suggests that the global economy has continued to recover, supported by accelerated vaccinations and the relaxation of restrictions on economic activity in major countries. In global financial markets, government bond yields in major countries have declined affected by the resurgence of COVID-19. The US dollar has strengthened and stock prices in emerging economies have fallen, due mainly to the possibility that the US Federal Reserve would start tapering its asset purchases within the year. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by monetary policy changes in major countries and their effects. The Korean economy has continued its sound recovery. Although private consumption has somewhat slowed due to the coronavirus resurgence, exports have sustained their buoyancy and facilities investment has shown a robust trend. Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with a sustained year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed. Going forward, the economy is likely to continue its recovery as private consumption is forecast to improve gradually, affected by the expansion of vaccinations and the execution of a supplementary budget, while exports and investment are expected to sustain their buoyancy. GDP growth this year is projected to be around 4%, consistent with the forecast in May. Consumer price inflation has remained high at the mid-2% level due to the rising prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products as well as the accelerating increase in service prices. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has run at the lower-1% level. The inflation expectations of the general public have risen to the mid-2% level. It is forecast that consumer price inflation will increase to the lower-2% level this year, exceeding the May forecast of 1.8%. Core inflation is forecast to run at the lower-1% level. In domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has risen considerably, mainly driven by global financial market movements and the domestic resurgence of COVID-19. The Korean Treasury bond yield, in particular the long-term bond yield, has declined. Household loan growth has accelerated and housing prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board will gradually adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation as the Korean economy is expected to continue its sound growth and inflation to run above 2% for some time, despite ongoing uncertainties over the virus. In this process the Board will judge when to further adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to COVID-19, changes in the pace of growth and inflation, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, and monetary policy changes in major countries."
Chile,2021-08-31,"NoPtrae sdse R eplereasnes*a Tuesday, 31 August 2021 Monetary Policy Meeting  August 2021 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 75 basis points, to 1.5%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of its members. The external scenario continues to anticipate a sustained recovery of the world economy, in a context where various countries are seeing a steady opening of their economies. Still, short- term indicators reveal a moderation in activity in the main economies, where there is some concern about the spread of the delta variant of Covid-19. In the emerging economies, the slow pace of vaccinations paints a less auspicious picture. Even so, because of inflationary pressures, several central banks have been joining others in the normalization of the monetary stimulus. With ups and downs, the copper price has remained at around US$4.2 per pound, while oil prices continue to be high. International financial markets maintain a positive tone, beyond movements associated with the pandemic's evolution or changes in expectations for U.S. monetary policy, with new drops in long-term interest rates and stock market increases in developed economies. In Chile, the performance of financial markets continues to be largely dominated by idiosyncratic factors, most notably the possibility of new massive withdrawals of pension savings. Interest rates in the fixed-income market have posted additional increases since the last Meeting, especially in the short end of the nominal curve. Ten-year rates also rose, widening the distance from their external peers. This contrasts with the significant drop in shorter-term UF yields, linked to the increase in inflation expectations, especially after the surprise in the July CPI figure. The exchange rate sustained its upward trend, with the peso accumulating a depreciation of close to 5% against the dollar since the last Meeting. The selected stock index IPSA showed some rebound in recent weeks, but it persists below its figures of earlier in the year. On the banking credit side, activity retains, in general, limited dynamism, amid the greater liquidity in the hands of households and businesses. Worth noting is the fact that the increase in long-term interest rates has already begun passing through to the mortgage market. In terms of activity, second-quarter GDP recorded an annual variation of 18.1%, exceeding the forecast in the June Report. The composition of spending showed extraordinary dynamism of private consumption, which surpassed expectations and indicates that liquidity injections to households are having a greater effect on consumption than expected. Data from the beginning of the third quarter confirm this trend, with retail sales remaining very strong. The extension of transfers to households until the end of the year means that the growth in fiscal spending forecast for 2021 will be higher than considered in the last Report. Investment has also surprised on the upside, heavily concentrated in its imported machinery and equipment component. The labor market continues to be affected by opposing forces, although with recent improvements. On the one hand, the May-July quarter saw an increase in employment in the main occupational categories (INE), while vacancy indicators are still on the rise, in line with the greater openness that has been taking place since the end of the second quarter. On the other hand, a reduced labor supply and gaps continue to be observed in the evolution of self-employment, some economic sectors, and women. The evolution of wages is consistent with growing labor shortages. Nota de prensa Annual CPI inflation increased again in July (4.5% annually; 0.8% monthly). Core inflation rose to 3.8% annually, driven by higher prices of both goods and services. Short-term inflation expectations have risen most recently. In the two-year term, the median of the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) is at 3%, while the Financial Traders' Survey (FTS) showed an increase to 3.5%. Higher activity growth and the strong expansion of consumption virtually closed the activity gap in the second quarter, and will turn it positive soon, increasing the pressure on prices. This has resulted in higher inflation and raises its short-term outlook. This result is compounded by the unfavorable behavior of other inflation-relevant variables, such as the greater exchange rate pass-through of the idiosyncratic peso depreciation, global supply that has yet to make a full comeback after the pandemic, and the increase in fuel prices. The Board has responded to the need to avoid the accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances that, among other consequences, could trigger a more persistent increase in inflation that would deviate it from the 3% target in a two-year horizon. Consequently, the Board decided to intensify the withdrawal of monetary stimulus, by raising the MPR by 75bp at this Meeting. The Monetary Policy Report to be published tomorrow contains the details of the central scenario, the sensitivities and risks around it, and its implications for the future evolution of the monetary policy interest rate. The minutes corresponding to this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Wednesday 15 September 2021. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will take place on Tuesday, 12 October and Wednesday 13 October 2021, and the statement thereof will be released at 18:00 hours of the second day. ___The Spanish original prevails.

Poland,2021-09-08,"Warsaw, 8 September 2021 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 8 September 2021. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: âª reference rate at 0.10%; âª lombard rate at 0.50%; âª deposit rate at 0.00%; âª rediscount rate at 0.11%; âª discount rate at 0.12%. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. The timing and scale of the conducted measures will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. Over the recent period, as the Delta variant of the coronavirus spread, the pandemic situation around the world has worsened. An increase in the number of infections together with supply constraints observed in certain markers hampered the improvement in some economic indicators. At the same time, data on GDP in 2021 Q2 confirmed a significant increase in activity in the major economies, which also encompassed a revival of the service sector. The prices of many commodities, including oil, are significantly higher than a year ago. In recent months the global prices of some agricultural products have also risen markedly. Along with the supply-side disruptions affecting the production of certain industrial goods, this has contributed to a significant rise in inflation in many economies, including in the United States and the euro area. However, due to persistently muted economic activity combined with uncertainty about the economic outlook, major central banks are keeping interest rates low while continuing asset purchases and signalling that loose monetary policy will be maintained in the future. In Poland, according to the preliminary estimate of Statistics Poland, the annual GDP growth in 2021 Q2 increased to 11.1% y/y. The main factor supporting the economic recovery was a strong rise in private consumption and  to a lesser extent  investment. 1/3 At the same time. LFS data suggested an improvement in labour market conditions in 2021 Q2. However, the average paid employment in the national economy is still persistently lower than before the pandemic. In July 2021, the annual growth of retail sales, industrial production and of construction and assembly output decreased, which was only partially driven by statistical base effects. This was accompanied by weaker annual increases in average employment in the enterprise sector and in average wage growth in this sector. At the same time, some people employed in sections most severely affected by the earlier restrictions still have their remuneration subsidised under anti-crisis measures. Available forecasts indicate that the coming quarters will see a continuation of the recovery in economic activity, although its scale and pace are highly uncertain. The further course of the pandemic and its impact on economic situation in Poland and abroad continues to be the main source of uncertainty. The economic policy measures, including the easing of NBP's monetary policy introduced last year, and the expected further recovery in the global economy will have a positive impact on the domestic economic situation. The pace of the economic recovery in Poland will also depend on further developments of the zloty exchange rate. According to the Statistics Poland flash estimate for August 2021, inflation in Poland increased to 5.4% in annual terms, and in monthly terms it amounted to 0.2%. The elevated inflation resulted, to a great extent, from fuel price growth  related to the significantly higher global oil prices than a year ago  as well as from food price growth. Additionally, annual inflation rate continued to be pushed up by the increase in electricity prices at the beginning of 2021 and the increases in waste disposal charges, i.e. by the factors that  similarly as growing commodity prices  are beyond the control of domestic monetary policy. The rising costs of running business amidst the pandemic, higher international transport charges and temporary disruptions in supply chains, also continue to add to inflation. The above-mentioned factors will probably translate into annual price growth staying above the upper bound for deviations from the inflation target in the coming months. At the same time, in 2022  after some factors temporarily increasing price growth fade  inflation is expected to decrease. Price developments next year will depend on the robustness of economic recovery, including the situation in the labour market following the phasing-out of the anti-crisis measures. As indicated in Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2/3 2021, due to the macroeconomic and financial shocks, inflation may temporarily deviate from the target and even run outside the band for deviations from the target. The response of monetary policy to the shocks is flexible and depends on their causes and the assessment of persistence of their effects, including their impact on inflation developments. NBP's monetary policy supports the consolidation of economic recovery following the pandemic-induced recession and stabilises inflation at the level consistent with the NBP's inflation target in the medium term. Taking into account the sources of currently elevated inflation and the expected temporary nature of higher inflation, while considering also the uncertainty about the robustness and scale of the economic recovery. NBP is keeping interest rates unchanged. At the same time. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in the secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP's interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In order to strengthen the impact of the NBP's monetary policy easing on the economy. NBP may also intervene in the foreign exchange market. The timing and scale of the measures taken by NBP will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will also continue to offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. The Council adopted Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2022."
Malaysia,2021-09-09,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 1.75 percent. The global economy continues to recover, supported by improvements in manufacturing and services activity. The strength of the recovery remains varied across countries mainly corresponding to their vaccination coverage, relaxation of containment measures and degree of policy support. Economies with better progress in their vaccination programmes have eased containment measures, enabling a continued recovery in domestic activity. Sizeable fiscal and monetary stimulus in several major economies continue to support the recovery momentum. Financial conditions also remain supportive of growth. Overall, the balance of risks to the global growth outlook is tilted to the downside. This is attributed mainly to uncertainty over the path of the pandemic amid the emergence of variants of concern, and potential risk of heightened financial market volatility amid adjustments in monetary policy in major economies. For the Malaysian economy, the re-imposition of nation-wide containment measures to curb the resurgence in COVID-19 cases had dampened the growth momentum. However, the recent gradual relaxations for more economic sectors to operate, along with higher adaptability of firms to the new operating environment and continued policy support, would partly mitigate the impact and allow the economy to resume its recovery path. Moving forward, the further easing of containment measures, rapid progress of the domestic vaccination programme and continued expansion in global demand will support the growth momentum going into 2022. Risks to the growth outlook, however, remain tilted to the downside due to external and domestic factors. These include delays in the easing or re-imposition of broad-based containment measures due to the impact of new COVID-19 variants of concern and a weaker-than-expected global growth recovery. Year-to-date, headline inflation has averaged 2.3%, and is projected to average between 2.0% and 3.0% for 2021. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to remain subdued, averaging between 0.5% and 1.5% for the year, amid continued spare capacity in the economy. The outlook, however, continues to be subject to global commodity price developments and policy measures to alleviate the cost burden of the public. Underlying inflation, however, is expected to remain relatively subdued in 2022. The MPC considers the stance of monetary policy to be appropriate and accommodative. In addition, fiscal and financial measures will continue to cushion the economic impact on businesses and households and provide support to economic activity. Given the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the stance of monetary policy will continue to be determined by new data and information and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth. The Bank remains committed to utilise its policy levers as appropriate to foster enabling conditions for a sustainable economic recovery. Bank Negara Malaysia 09 September 2021."
Peru,2021-09-09,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT SEPTEMBER 2021 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 1.0% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 50 bps to 1.0 percent. Monetary policy is still expansionary with a historically low reference interest rate. The current decision does not necessarily imply a cycle of successive increases in the reference rate. This decision takes into account the following developments: The year-on-year inflation rate increased from 3.81 percent in July to 4.95 percent in August being temporarily above the target range due to factors such as the increase in international prices of food and fuel, as well as the exchange rate. Trend inflation remains around the center of the target range. Year-on- year core inflation was 2.39 percent in August. Inflation is expected to return to the target range in the next twelve months and remain within that range for the rest of next year, due to the reversal of the effects of transitory factors on the inflation rate (exchange rate, fuel and grain prices in international markets) and that economic activity will remain below its potential level. One-year-ahead expected inflation increased from 3.0 percent in July to 3.1 in August, being slightly above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most leading indicators and expectations about the economy deteriorated in August and remain in pessimistic territory. Global economic activity is improving and this process is expected to continue in the next quarters, as the vaccination process continues around the world, and significant stimulus packages are implemented in developed countries. The Board is especially attentive to new information referring to inflation expectations and the evolution of economic activity to consider, if necessary, changes in the monetary policy position. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows. Financial markets were highly volatile in a context of uncertainty and the BCRP's actions were intended to mitigate this volatility The Board also decided to raise the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 0.85 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 1.5 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on October 7, 2021."
Ukraine,2021-09-09,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to raise the key policy rate to 8.5% per annum. In addition, the NBU will stop applying its anti-crisis monetary measures at the start of Q4. Tighter monetary policy will help rein in inflation expectations and bring back a steady disinflation trend toward the 5% target, which is projected to be met in 2022. Inflation has been exceeding 10% in the last several months, influenced by both temporary and fundamental factors. Still, it remains close to the forecast trajectory. In July 2021, consumer prices grew by 10.2% yoy, which was in line with the latest macroeconomic forecast (July 2021 Inflation Report). Inflation continued to accelerate in August, according to the NBU's preliminary estimates. Despite a correction of prices for some foods and a gradual weakening of the low comparison base effect, sustained high global prices for energy and food made a large contribution to headline inflation. Unfavorable weather in JulyAugust also impacted domestic prices of some food products. Underlying inflationary pressures are also persisting. Current estimates by the State Statistics Service of Ukraine show that GDP growth in Q2 2021 (5.4% yoy) was below the NBU forecast (7.5% yoy), mainly due to temporary and technical factors. At the same time, the economy has been recovering quickly in Q3, thanks to large harvests, favorable external environment, sustained consumer demand, and revived investment activity. Taking into account the economic recovery, an increase in migration pressures, and the impact of structural factors, wages continue to grow at a fast pace. The rapid growth in real household income supports domestic demand. This is evidenced, among other things, by a pickup in retail trade and high demand for durable goods. Inflation expectations remain high. They have deteriorated slightly since the previous NBU Board meeting on monetary policy issues. The risk remains that inflation expectations will keep de-anchoring. At the same time, core inflation has stabilized over last months, particularly thanks to a correction of sunflower oil prices and the stronger hryvnia. The strengthening of the hryvnia was driven by the benign external environment for Ukrainian exporters and the NBU's prudent monetary policy. Inflation will slow at the end of this year and gradually return to the 5% target in 2022. The NBU expects inflation to remain within the range of 10%11% in SeptemberOctober and decline below 10% in the last months of the year. Inflation will continue to slow next year: it will gradually return to the target of 5%. The waning effect of last year's low comparison base, a correction of global commodity prices, and new, larger harvests of agricultural crops coming to the market will contribute to the decline in inflation. The NBU tightening its monetary policy will also restrain the price growth. As before, the primary assumption of the NBU Board is that Ukraine will continue to cooperate with the IMF. The disbursement of USD 2.7 billion to Ukraine as part of an SDR allocation by the IMF helped finance Ukraine's short-term budget needs, including external debt repayments. At the same time, to maintain its macrofinancial stability in the coming years. Ukraine must continue to cooperate with the IMF under the stand-by program. The implementation of the IMF program will ensure access to official funding from other sources, contribute to lower interest rates on external borrowing, and support foreign investors' appetite for hryvnia assets. At this time, major risks to the economy are the potential imposition of much tighter quarantine measures in Ukraine and globally, and a longer and stronger-than-expected surge in global inflation. The spread of new variants of COVID-19 may lead to another tightening of quarantine restrictions and a weakening of economic activity. The direction of the impact on inflation will be determined by the ratio between proinflationary factors (due to production chain disruptions) and disinflationary factors (driven by a weaker aggregate demand). A longer-than-expected price surge in commodity markets and Ukraine's MTPs will put pressure on domestic prices and pose the risk of a longer-term deviation of inflation from its 5% target. Other proinflationary risks continue to loom large. Those include an escalation of Russian military aggression against Ukraine and a sharp worsening of terms of trade. Given the balance of risks, and considering how close the actual dynamics of macro indicators are to the current forecast, the NBU Board decided to raise its key policy rate to 8.5%. This decision corresponds to the projected trajectory of the key policy rate (see the July 2021 Inflation Report). In addition, as previously reported, the NBU approved the rollback of its emergency monetary measures, specifically the termination of long-term refinancing tenders and interest rate swap auctions, starting in Q4 2021. To boost the efficiency of monetary transmission, the NBU also continued to normalize the design of its monetary policy. From 1 October, the maturity of refinancing loans is reduced to 30 days from 90 days. If underlying inflationary pressures increase significantly and inflation expectations continue to worsen, the NBU stands ready to take additional measures to return inflation to its 5% target. Effective 10 September 2021, the increase in the key policy rate to 8.5% was approved by NBU Board's Key Policy Rate Decision No. 461 dated 9 September 2021. A summary of the discussion between Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of the NBU Board's decision will be published on 20 August 2021. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 21 October 2021 as scheduled."
Russia,2021-09-10,"On 10 September 2021, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to increase the key rate by 25 b.p. to 6.75% per annum. In 2021 Q2, the Russian economy reached its pre-pandemic level and is, according to Bank of Russia estimates, returning to a balanced growth path. The contribution of persistent factors to inflation remains considerable on the back of faster growth in demand relative to output expansion capacity. In this environment, given high inflation expectations, the balance of risks for inflation is tilted to the upside. This may bring about a more sustained deviation of inflation from the target. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy stance is aimed to limit this risk and return inflation to 4%. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate rises at its upcoming meetings. Key rate decisions will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, annual inflation will begin to slow down in 2021 Q4. Given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will edge down to 4.0-4.5% in 2022 and will remain close to 4% further on. Inflation dynamics. Inflation is developing above the Bank of Russia's forecast. In August, monthly consumer price growth (seasonally adjusted) was up again, after a slowdown in July. Annual inflation rose to 6.68% (vs 6.46% in July). According to an estimate as of 6 September, it is 6.74%. Based on Bank of Russia estimates, indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are persistently above 4% (annualised). This largely reflects the fact that steady growth in domestic demand exceeds production expansion capacity in a wide range of sectors. In this context, businesses find it easier to pass higher costs, including on the back of rising global commodity markets, on to prices. Inflation expectations of households have held close to their four-year highs for more than six months. Businesses' price expectations remain near their multi-year highs. Analysts' medium-term expectations are anchored close to 4%. The dominating influence of proinflationary factors could lead to a more substantial and prolonged upward deviation of inflation from the target. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy stance is aimed to limit this risk and return annual inflation to 4%. According to the baseline scenario, annual inflation will begin to slow down in 2021 Q4. It is forecast to edge down to 4.0-4.5% in 2022 and will remain close to 4% further on. Monetary conditions have slightly tightened. Yields of short-term OFZs have risen, reflecting expectations for the Bank of Russia to raise the key rate. Yields of medium- and long-term OFZs have remained steady. Loan and deposit rates are rapidly adjusting to the March-July key rate hikes. The outflow of funds from fixed-term ruble deposits has stopped. At the same time, corporate lending is continuing to grow at rates close to recent years' highs. Growth in mortgage lending slowed down following changes in the parameters of subsidised programmes. Consumer lending is still growing at high paces. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy stance will make it possible for bank deposits to become more attractive to households, will protect the purchasing power of savings and ensure balanced expansion in lending. Economic activity. The Russian economy reached its pre-pandemic level in 2021 Q2. High-frequency estimates suggest that economic activity continued to grow in Q3 albeit at a somewhat slower pace. Based on Bank of Russia estimates, this is largely associated with the return of the Russian economy to a balanced growth path. At the same time, economic trends are diverse across industries and regions. Growth in real wages and households' low propensity to save, driven by high inflation expectations, support growth in consumer activity, especially in non-food markets. At the same time, the recovery of the commercial services sector decelerated between July and August due to partially tightened anti-pandemic measures. Growing domestic and external demand and high corporate profits shore up investment activity. Inflationary pressure from the labour market is intensifying. Demand for labour is growing in many industries. At the same time, some sectors show labour shortages, including due to remaining restrictions on the inflow of foreign labour. The unemployment rate is close to its record lows, while the number of vacancies is at its record highs. The state of the labour market suggests that a further increase in steady growth rates of the Russian economy will primarily be conditional on the growth paces of labour productivity. Inflation risks. The balance of risks remains significantly shifted towards proinflationary ones. Their effect may be strengthened by elevated inflation expectations and corresponding secondary effects. Further proinflationary pressure may be caused by remaining disruptions in production and logistics chains, labour shortages, as well as structural changes in the labour market caused by the pandemic. An increase in structural labour shortages may cause labour productivity growth to considerably lag behind wage growth. Proinflationary risks remain to be generated by price movements in global commodity markets. Further changes in food prices will largely depend on agricultural harvest in 2021 both in Russia and abroad. Short-term proinflationary risks are also associated with the stronger volatility in global markets caused in part by various geopolitical developments, which may affect exchange rate and inflation expectations. As the global economic recovery is progressing faster and, therefore, the need is no longer in place for unprecedented accommodative policies in advanced economies, earlier monetary policy normalisation in these countries is possible. This may become an additional source of higher volatility in global financial markets. Disinflationary risks for the baseline scenario remain moderate. Opening up the borders concurrently with a gradual lifting of restrictions may lead to a recovery in the consumption of foreign services and weaken supply-side constraints in the labour market owing to an inflow of foreign labour force. Further economic recovery may be held back by, among other things, low vaccination rates and the spread of new coronavirus strains, as well as the ensuing tightening of restrictions. Medium-term inflation is largely influenced by fiscal policy. In its baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia proceeds from the fiscal policy normalisation path stipulated by the Guidelines for Fiscal. Tax and Customs and Tariff Policy, which assumes a return to fiscal rule parameters in 2022. In its forecast, the Bank of Russia will also factor in decisions to invest the liquid part of the National Wealth Fund in excess of the threshold level of 7% of GDP. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate rises at its upcoming meetings. Key rate decisions will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 22 October 2021. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the medium-term forecast are to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. Statement by Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina in follow-up to Board of Directors meeting on 10 September 2021.

Kazakhstan,2021-09-13,"Press-Release  17 The base rate raised to 9.50% September 13, 2021 Nur-Sultan The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to set the base rate at 9.50% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1.00 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities set on 10.50% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 8.50%. The decision was stipulated by the prevailing pro-inflationary pressure in the economy caused by global inflationary trends in food and raw materials prices, with a faster recovery of global demand over output. This pressure is reinforced by internal off-season shocks and actively recovering consumer demand, as well as rising prices for electricity, gas and fuel. As a result, annual inflation accelerated to 8.7%. The inflationary background is also strengthened by the increased inflation expectations of the population, which in August amounted to 8.8%. Re-emerging COVID-19 outbreaks have slowed down business activity in the world and aggravated global supply problems, strengthening pro-inflationary processes. According to the IMF forecasts, due to vaccination and stimulus measures, the world economy will show a rapid recovery this year, followed by a slowdown in 2022. The international organizations forecasts for the Kazakhstan's trading partners' economies growth have been improved for the EU and Russia, and for China they have been slightly reduced. Global inflationary pressure continues to remain at an elevated level due to an increase in prices for food, raw materials, metals and cars. The contribution to the inflationary trend is formed by increased world food prices. This is evidenced by the growth in annual terms of the FAO food price index in August 2021 by 32.9%. As a result, manufacturers around the world report continuing problems with supplies and high prices for logistics, raw materials and final products. Thus, according to the Baltic Dry Index, the container shipping cost increased by 3.4 times compared to December 2019, and by 7.4 times compared to May 2020. Due to this, the total level of inflation in the countries continues to grow, exceeding the targets of the monetary authorities. Thus, in the United States, inflation in July 2021 reached the maximum value in 13 years  5.4%, in the Eurozone  the maximum value in 10 years of 3%, in Russia  the maximum value in 5 years of 6.7% in August 2021 year. In this regard, representatives of the world's largest regulators declare the expediency of an earlier winding down of the asset purchase program, and developing countries have already begun a cycle of tightening monetary conditions. At the same time, the reduction of monetary incentives from the US Federal Reserve and the ECB may lead to an increase in volatility in financial markets. As a result, food inflation remains the main driver of price growth, which reached 11.4% in August. The average monthly inflation values since April 2021 exceed the average values for the last 20 years, which is unusual for the summer months. A significant contribution to the current acceleration of annual food inflation was made by a sharp jump in prices for vegetables (by 26.1%), in particular for long-term vegetables (potatoes  by 29.7%, carrots  by 68.2%, beets  by 124.0%). Because of domestic stocks depletion before the new crop arrival, the monthly increase in prices for these products showed record values, uncharacteristic for the summer period. There is an increase in prices for meat and meat products (by 9.5%), caused by an increase in producer prices due to an increase in feed crops cost. Following the global trend, the accelerated growth of prices for vegetable oils continued (sunflower  by 66.8%, olive  by 9.0%), caused by supply reduction in the world market. Non-food inflation accelerated to 7.3% in August 2021 as a result of the continued increase in prices for fuel and lubricants (by 13.1%), clothing and footwear (by 6.5%). The factors of the increase in fuel prices are the increase in the production cost and the economic activity recovery, while the prices of clothing and footwear are growing due to the increase in prices for imported goods and the consumer demand recovery. Paid services inflation in August 2021 was 6.6%. The increase in prices for paid services is caused by an increase in tariffs for regulated public utilities (an increase of 6.3%) as a result of an increase in electricity prices (by 10.1%). Also, in the structure of service inflation there is an increase in the transport services cost (by 4.1%), in particular air transport (by 21.3%), and a number of other unregulated services given the consumer demand recovery. Economic activity demonstrates dynamic growth rates given the recovery of many sectors of the economy. In 7 months of 2021. GDP growth amounted to 2.7% in annual terms. The demand recovery in the industries continues, as well as an increase in the production capacities utilization and the volume of products produced. The composite leading indicator, which is an aggregated assessment of real sector enterprises, rose to 100.1 in the second quarter of 2021 and will continue to grow to 100.2 in the third quarter of 2021, according to the National Bank surveys. A significant contribution to the economy growth is made by the demand recovery, that is confirmed by the retail trade positive dynamics, which increased by 6.1% in January  August 2021 due to the growth of trade in non-food products, supported by the accelerated pace of consumer credit. At the same time, high domestic demand is reflected in imports increase of consumer goods, which increased by 27.3% in the first half of 2021. The demand is supported by the positive dynamics of population real incomes. Thus, in the second quarter of 2021, despite the further acceleration of inflationary processes, real income growth continued, amounting to 1.5%. Additional pro-inflationary pressure continues to be made by the transfers volume from the National Fund, which reached 4.55 trillion tenge in 2021 as part of the anti-crisis measures implementation. The prospects of the global oil market development as a whole remained unchanged. By the end of August 2021. Brent crude oil prices fell by 4.4% due to the spread of the delta strain and the global economic growth slowdown. Oil reserves in the United States continued to decline (the decline was 13.8 million barrels in August, 13.1 million barrels in July and 26.9 million barrels in June), however, the pace of change slowed down. According to the updated forecasts of the International Energy Agency, the growth of oil demand in 2021 will be lower than previously expected. It is expected that the oil market will be relatively balanced by the end of the year. At the same time, from 2022, due to the OPEC+ countries agreement on a monthly increase in production by 400 thousand barrels per day and an increase in oil production in the United States, oil supply will outpace demand growth, creating prerequisites for oil prices correction. Taking into account these trends, the main assumption for the baseline scenario forecast is the oil price of $60 per barrel in the remaining months of 2021 and until the end of the forecast period. According to the baseline scenario, the GDP growth forecast until the end of 2021 has been revised down slightly, which is due to a slightly slower economic recovery than previously expected. In 2021. Kazakhstan's GDP growth is expected at the level of 3.53.8%. The main driver will be actively recovering consumer demand, which is supported by moderate growth in real incomes. GDP growth will also be supported by real exports due to an increase in external demand and energy production volumes. In turn, imports increase will have a restraining effect on GDP growth as a result of the domestic consumer activity recovery and a slight increase in investment activity. Economic growth in 2022 is projected at 4.14.4%, which is slightly higher than the previous estimate. The economic growth acceleration will be accompanied by the weakening impact of the pandemic on economic activity and an increase in oil and gas condensate production as a result of the gradual easing of OPEC+ restrictions. When updating the inflation basic forecast, an Anti-inflationary Response Package approved by the Government on behalf of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan to stabilize non-monetary factors of inflation was taken into account. The adoption of operational measures will allow, according to the Government, to reduce food inflation to 8% by the end of this year. Taking into account the historical dynamics of inflation in the last 4 months of the year, as well as the effectiveness degree of Anti-inflationary Response Package implementation, in 2021 annual inflation will be in the range of 7.58.5%. In the baseline scenario, inflation processes will maintain the current dynamics until the end of the year, and by the end of the year, inflation will be closer to the upper limit of the forecast range. The lower limit of the inflation forecast range is determined given the potential for reducing inflation as part of the effective implementation of an Anti-inflationary Response Package by the Government. Subsequent decisions on the base rate will be made, including given the assessment of the implemented anti-inflationary measures effectiveness. In 2022, moving from the high base of 2021, inflation will begin to slow down to the upper limit of the target corridor of 46%. The slowdown in inflation will occur as a result of softening of the external inflationary background and the expected decline in world food prices after their significant increase this year. At the same time, the disinflation processes in 2022 will largely depend on the expected grain harvest in Kazakhstan this year, the global supply chains restoration and the level of the domestic economy fiscal stimulation in 20222023. The National Bank will continue to conduct a deflationary monetary policy, assessing the effectiveness of anti-inflationary measures implementation and the risks of monetary incentives reduction from the US Federal Reserve and the ECB. These measures, in accordance with the Monetary Policy Strategy 2030, will help reduce inflation to the target range of 46% in 2022. The next planned decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on October 25, 2021 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time.

Armenia,2021-09-14,"PRESS RELEASE 14.09.2021 At the September 14, 2021 meeting, the CBA Board decided to raise the refinancing rate by 0.25 pp, setting it at 7.25%. Inflation of 0.4% was recorded in August 2021 as opposed to deflation of 0.1% registered in the same month of the previous year, in which case the 12-month inflation has continued to increase amounting to 8.8% at the end of the month; the 12-month core inflation in August persisted around 8.0% as well. In the third quarter of 2021, despite some slowing in the use of coronavirus vaccines around the world and new outbreaks of the pandemic in many countries, the economic activity and aggregate demand in the main partner countries to Armenia continue growing at faster-than-expected rates. In such a situation, influenced by a number of supply and demand factors, the environment in the international markets of raw materials and food products remains inflationary, just as the inflation in the partner countries runs a path which is higher relative to the previous forecasts. In this circumstance, mostly an inflationary impact is expected from the external sector on the Armenian economy. The current economic growth developments in Armenia in 2021 are assessed as more positive than expected, owing to larger increases reported in agriculture and services. Aggregate demand is growing at a slightly faster-than-expected rate, which continues to be supported by strong private consumption growth, larger-than-expected remittances from abroad, and a positive external demand environment, while private investment growth remains relatively subdued. In such circumstances, the Board of the Central Bank estimates that the surpassing growth of private consumption over production capacity currently contributes to the expanding of the domestic inflationary environment. The short-term acceleration of inflation in recent months is mainly due to rising seasonal food product prices, whereas the core inflation has been hovering at a level lower than anticipated. On the other hand, mainly inflationary effects continue coming from both the external and domestic economies, this is why the CBA Board finds it reasonable to raise the policy rate. At the same time, the Board considers that consistent tightening of monetary conditions recently is having a significant impact for handling the surpassing demand, containing the inflation, and fulfilling the inflation target in the medium run. Under such conditions, it is forecasted that the 12-month inflation will remain high up until the end of the year, then in 2022 it will approach the 4% target and will stabilize around it in the medium term. As uncertainties over the economic outlook are still persisting, the CBA Board estimates that the risks to inflation deviating from the projected mid-term path are balanced, and should they materialize, the CBA will stand ready to respond accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective. You can read detailed information about setting the interest rate level in Inflation Report (MP Program. Q3, 2021) to be published by September 29, 2021.

Georgia,2021-09-15,"15.09.2021 The National Bank of Georgia keeps its monetary policy rate unchanged at 10.0 percent On September 15, 2021, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged. The monetary policy rate is 10.0 percent. Inflation remains a significant global challenge of the recent period, and the price growth trajectory has far exceeded the forecasts in many developed as well as developing countries. Georgia's annual inflation at 12.8 percent in August was also higher than expected. The driving forces of high inflation are still predominately one-off and independent from monetary policy. According to the preliminary estimates, the contribution of such exogenous factors to headline inflation is about 9 percentage points. The sharply increased prices of food and oil in international markets since the beginning of the year are particularly noteworthy. In addition, the increasing dynamics of international shipping costs are making imported products more expensive globally. Despite the recent appreciation of the exchange rate, in August the growth of prices of imported products accelerated to 18.7 percent year-on-year, which is significantly higher than the increase in prices for domestic goods (8.2 percent). As for domestic demand, the growth rate of lending has recently increased, although it is moderate at this stage and does not create demand-side inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, the NBG remains vigilant and closely monitors the growth of credit and its impact on demand. Inflation is expected to remain high for the rest of the year. However, given that the contribution of temporary factors to inflation will continue to be the driving force and, at the same time, monetary policy stance is tight, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate at the current level. In December 2021 and January-February 2022, the base effect of the utility subsidy will have an additional upward impact on the annual inflation figure. According to the current forecast, other things equal, inflation will decline significantly from spring 2022, which, along with the fading-out of temporary factors, will be facilitated by tight monetary policy and fiscal consolidation. External demand continues to grow. According to the preliminary data, exports of goods in January- August increased by 26 percent annually and is 7 percent higher compared to the same period in 2019. Revenues from international travelers increased by 46 percent year-on-year in the first eight months, although it is lower by 69 percent compared to the same period in 2019. Imports also increased, against the backdrop of higher domestic demand, and in January-August it grew by 21 percent, which is about 1 percent higher than in 2019. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the MPC will be held on October 27, 2021."
Egypt,2021-09-16,"Press Release September 16th, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 825 percent, 925 percent, and 875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 875 percen. Annual headline urban inflation increased to 57 percent in August 2021 from 54 percent in July 2021, after having accelerated from 49 percent in June 202. Meanwhile annual core inflation slightly declined to 45 percent in August 2021 from 46 percent in July 2021, after having increased from 38 percent in June 202. Annual headline inflation rates were affected by unfavorable base effects during July 2021 and August 2021 as August 2020 and July 2020 reflected the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and its resulting containment measures on inventory levels and consumption pattern. Accordingly the acceleration in August 2021 and July 2021 was mainly driven by higher annual contribution of food item. Annual food inflation increased for the fourth consecutive month to 66 percent in August 2021 from 48 percent in July 202. Meanwhile slightly offsetting this acceleration, is the decline in annual non-food inflation to 53 percent in August 2021 from 57 percent in July 2021, which is the lowest recorded level since April 201. Real GDP growth recorded a preliminary figure of 77 percent in 2021 Q2, reflecting the sustained recovery of economic activity; as it continues to gather pace and rebound from last year's trough at negative 17 percen. The aforementioned development reflects a strong favorable base effect compared to the corresponding quarter's shrunken base during the peak of the pandemic last yea. In addition, this implies that growth in fiscal year 2020/21 registered 33 percent, an upward revision from the 28 percent that was estimated previously and compared to 36 percent in the previous fiscal yea. Moreover leading indicators point towards a sustained strong pick-up across most sector. Meanwhile the unemployment rate stabilized at 73 percent in 2021 Q2 compared to 74 percent in 2021 Q. Global economic activity continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, although growth remains uneven across regions, as the pace of vaccinations varies across countrie. Additionally prospects of global economic recovery remain contingent on the efficacy of vaccines and the ability of countries to contain the spread of the virus, in light of the emergence of newer variant. Global financial conditions continue to be accommodativ. Compared to the last MPC, median forecasts for Brent oil prices are broadly stable, while international prices for food and some other commodities remain at multi-year high. Against this background, the MPC decided that keeping policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 7 percent (Â±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandat.

Mongolia,2021-09-16,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged and setting the refinancing amount No: 2021/03 Date: September 16, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia held a scheduled meeting on September 16th, 2021. Due to the current state of the economy and financial markets, while considering the future outlook and risks inherent in domestic and foreign environments, the MPC decided to: 1. Keep the policy rate unchanged at 6 percent; 2. Provide up to MNT 100 billion under the Bank of Mongolia's long-term repo financing instrument in the fourth quarter of 2021. Annual headline inflation reached 8.9 percent nationwide and 9.1 percent in Ulaanbaatar city as of August 2021. Even though the economic recovery pushed inflation to rise at certain extent, inflation is mainly driven by base year effects and transitory factors. As a result of latter, the headline inflation may continue to rise, however, it is expected to stabilize around the central bank's target level in the second half of 2022. Nevertheless, due to the global economic recovery and international supply chain and logistics disruptions, foreign inflation, world food and oil prices may rise more than our expectations and domestic supply-side inflation pressure may increase, leading to the potential risk in headline inflation. Global economic growth has accelerated, and the prices of exporting goods have remained high, but its positive impact on domestic economy remained less than expected. Although the Government and Central bank's policy measures supported the economy, the growth was lower than our expectation in the previous quarter, largely due to the import delay, past quarantine measures and sluggish growth in the construction, manufacturing and services sectors. The continuing spread of new variants of the Covid-19 virus around the world reducing the effectiveness of vaccinations and increasing caution, are creating more uncertainty in the global and domestic economic environment. During the times of economic downturn caused by the pandemic, the Central bank's monetary and macro- prudential policy, and financial support measures are contributing to facilitate economic recovery and ensure banking sector stability. The current monetary policy stance is consistent with the purpose of stabilizing inflation and supporting the economic recovery, but the necessary policy adjustments will be made as the economic recovery stabilizes and inflation exceeds the target level permanently. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Nigeria,2021-09-17,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 138 OF THE 281ST MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON THURSDAY, 16th AND FRIDAY, 17th SEPTEMBER 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 16th and 17th September, 2021, on a relatively comforting note of a moderate global output growth recovery and improved global trade. The performance of the global economy in the first two quarters of the year and into the third quarter, remained favourable with positive outlook for the rest of the year. However cautious optimism persists, driven primarily by mutating and more fatal strains of the COVID-19 virus and disparities in the progress of vaccinations across several countries. In the domestic economy, output growth performance continued to improve, signposting the positive impact of the unwavering fiscal and monetary support by both the fiscal and monetary authorities to revive and sustain economic growth, post pandemic. The Committee reviewed the developments in the global and domestic economic environments in the third quarter of 2021, as well as the outlook for the rest of the year. Ten (10) members of the Committee attended this meeting. Global Economic Developments The Committee noted the continuing rebound in the global recovery as several advanced and emerging market economies posted promising second quarter output growth figures, despite the uneven progress in vaccination coverage. The MPC noted that the uncontained spread of the COVID-19 virus continues to pose downside risks to global recovery in 2021 and into 2022. The MPC further noted that despite the strong output growth identified in some Advanced Economies, several developing economies were still lagging in vaccination progress. Members emphasized that the widespread availability of vaccines, remained vital to surmounting the Pandemic and attaining full and all-inclusive 1 recovery of the global economy. Despite the challenges posed by the ongoing mutation of the coronavirus, governments across the globe remain focused on easing business restrictions and resuscitating economic activities. Consequently the International Monetary Fund (IMF), maintained its aggregate projection for global growth in 2021 at 60 per cent, but increased its projection for the Advanced Economies to 56 per cent from a previous 51 per cent, while that for the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) was downgraded to 63 per cent from 67 per cent. Price development across several Advanced Economies has remained on a sustained uptrend and exceeding their long run objectives. This is expected to continue in the short to medium term as against earlier forecasts that the upward shift was transient. Consequently several central banks of advanced economies are currently considering early commencement of monetary policy normalization, even though policy rate adjustments are not expected in the medium term. Across several Emerging Market and Developing Economies, inflationary pressures remained mixed, as some economies had much higher rates than their peers, due to lingering exchange rate pressures, capital flow reversals, high energy costs, supply chain disruptions and poor response to policy stimulus resulting from structural bottlenecks. In the global financial markets, the Committee noted that while demand for equities remained strong, an indication of renewed market confidence, gold price still maintained its post-Pandemic high, reflecting the hedging by investors against a possible rebound of the Pandemic. Long-term sovereign bond yields are expected to improve with the commencement of monetary policy normalization by central banks of advanced economy. Committee members, however, expressed cautious optimism for a gradual normalization of monetary policy by these central banks, as a sharp retreat of policy stimulus may plunge the global economy into a financial crisis again. This may also increase the uncertainty around the full recovery of several Emerging Market and Developing Economies. The MPC, therefore, called on the Bank to put in place measures to 2 moderate the likely impact of the normalization of monetary policy on the domestic economy. Domestic Economic Developments In the second quarter of 2021, there was a significant improvement in the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which grew by 501 per cent compared with 051 and -610 per cent in the previous quarter and corresponding quarter of 2020, respectively. This recovery was attributed to the non-oil sector, driven by a rebound in services sector and continued growth in agriculture sector. The oil sector contracted further by -1265 per cent (year-on year) in the second quarter of 2021, compared with -221 per cent in the previous quarter. This deeper contraction, was attributed to several factors: including declining crude oil production at two crude streams in the country, associated with leakages in two major pipelines; deteriorating oil production infrastructure; poor pipeline maintenance; and the need to comply with OPEC+ production ceiling. The Committee noted the moderate improvement in both the Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Indices (PMIs), though still below the 50-index point benchmark, showed a marked improvement over time. In August 2021, the Manufacturing and non-Manufacturing PMIs improved to 469 index points apiece, compared with 466 and 448 index points, respectively, in July 2021. This was attributed to an increase in new orders, driven largely by rising demand, uptrend in business activity and further normalization of economic activities. Similarly the employment level index component of the Manufacturing and non-Manufacturing PMIs in August 2021 improved to 494 and 488 index points, respectively, compared with 465 and 470 index points in July 2021. The Committee expressed optimism that with the current level of monetary and fiscal stimuli, as well as efforts to increase vaccination and contain the Pandemic, the economy will continue to improve in the short-to medium term. The Committee reviewed the performance of the Bank's interventions to sustain the recovery of output growth and address the downside risks to other external 3 and domestic shocks to the economy. Interventions continued largely in Manufacturing. Agriculture. Energy/infrastructure and Micro. Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The Bank under its Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) has cumulatively released the sum of N79809 billion to 39 million smallholder farmers cultivating 49 million hectares of land across the country. Out of this for the 2021 wet season farming, the Bank released the sum of â¦16118 billion to 770,,000 small-holder farmers cultivating seven commodities on 110 million hectares across the country. While harvesting for the 2020 dry season under the Programme is rounding up, harvesting activities have commenced for the 2021 wet season cultivation. The Strategic Maize Reserve Programme of the CBN has been useful in moderating maize prices by directly targeting large feed mill producers. Under its Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme (CACS), the CBN has supported 657 large-scale agricultural projects, to the tune of N70839 billion. To support MSMEs across the country, the Bank disbursed N13457 billion to 38,,140 beneficiaries under the Agribusiness/Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS), and for the Targeted Credit Facility (TCF), the sum of N34321 billion has been released to 726,,198 beneficiaries, comprising 602,,730 households and 123,,468 Small and Medium Enterprises. Under the Real Sector Facility, the Bank released the sum of N100 trillion to 269 real sector projects, of which 140 are in light manufacturing, 71 in agro-based industry, 47 in services and 11 in mining. Under the Healthcare Sector Intervention Facility (HSIF). N10302 billion has been disbursed for 110 healthcare projects, of which 27 are pharmaceutical, 77 hospitals and 6 other healthcare service projects. The Bank has also disbursed a total of N14599 billion under its Non-Oil Export Stimulation Facility (NESF). The CBN has revised the guidelines, working with Nigerian Export-Import Bank to improve access to the intervention and stimulate non-oil export growth in Nigeria. Under the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP). N4106 billion has been disbursed to ten (10) DisCos, for the procurement and installation of 759,,748 4 electricity meters. Under the Nigerian Electricity Market Stabilization Facility - 2 (NEMSF-2), the Bank has released the sum of N14566 billion to 11 DisCos as loans to provide liquidity support and stimulate critical infrastructure investment to improve service delivery and collection efficiency. In furtherance of its intervention in the energy sector, the Bank has disbursed N3920 billion to six beneficiaries to improve gas-based infrastructure to support the Federal Government's Auto-Gas Conversion Programme. The Bank has also encouraged Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) to participate in the Solar Connection Facility (SCF) to improve energy access in the rural areas. To promote entrepreneurship development among Nigerian youth, the Bank recently approved the implementation of the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES). The Scheme is designed to promote entrepreneurial activities and foster job creation among Nigerian youths. The Committee applauded the continued moderation in headline inflation for the fifth consecutive month to 1701 per cent (year-on-year) in August 2021 from 1738 per cent in July 2021. The continued decrease was attributed to a marginal decline in the food component to 2030 per cent in August 2021 from 2103 per cent in July 2021. The core component, also, declined to 1341 per cent in August 2021 from 1372 per cent in July 2021. The MPC noted that headline inflation remained well above the Bank's benchmark corridor of 6 â 9 per cent, but expressed optimism that with sustained interventions by the Bank, food production will continue to improve, thus moderating headline inflation further. The Committee, thus, urged the fiscal authority to build on earlier efforts to articulate a clear strategy to attract private sector investment while resuscitating critical infrastructure to improve the ease of doing business in the country. Members observed that broad money supply (M3) rose to 583 per cent in August 2021, compared with 291 per cent in July 2021. This was largely driven by the growth of Net Foreign Assets and Net Domestic Assets by 1235 and 430 per cent in August 2021, compared with 184 and 317 per cent in July 2021, respectively. The growth in Net Foreign Assets was largely driven by increase in foreign asset holdings of commercial and merchant banks. The increase in Net 5 Domestic Assets reflects the boost to aggregate credit net, which increased to 814 per cent in August 2021, from 571 per cent in July 2021. In the money market, the monthly weighted average Inter-Bank Call and Open Buyback (OBB) rates increased to 1345 and 1297 per cent in August 2021 from 1072 and 1160 per cent in July 2021, respectively. This increase reflected the tight liquidity conditions in the banking system during the review period as the Bank curtailed excess system liquidity. The MPC noted the moderate improvement in the equities market in the review period, as the All-Share Index (ASI) increased by 267 per cent from 37,,90728 on June 30, 2021, to 38,,92050 on September 14, 2021. Market Capitalization (MC) also increased by 263 per cent from N1976 trillion to N2028 trillion over the same period, reflecting improvement in investor confidence following the strengthening of output growth. The MPC noted that the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and the Liquidity Ratio (LR) both remained above the prudential limits at 152 and 417 per cent, respectively at end-July 2021. The Committee, also, welcomed the improvement in the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio at 54 per cent in July 2021, compared with 57 per cent in June 2021. The Committee thus, urged the Bank to sustain current efforts to bring NPLs below the 50 per cent prudential benchmark. The Committee noted the improvement in lending to the real sector following the introduction of the Loans-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) in 2019. Industry gross credit increased by N663 trillion from N1557 trillion at end-May, 2019 to N2220 trillion at end-July, 2021. The credit growth was largely recorded in manufacturing, oil and gas and agriculture sectors. The Committee noted the significant increase in the external reserves which rose to US$3597 billion at end-August 2021 from US$3349 billion at end-July 2021, representing an increase of 741per cent. It also welcomed the further increase to US$3603 billion on September 13, 2021. Outlook The outlook for both the global and domestic economies appears mixed. This is due to lingering uncertainties over the end of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as continued mutation of the virus. The slow and uneven pace of vaccination in developing economies is also compromising the achievement of global herd immunity, thus imposing a considerable headwind to the attainment of the global growth forecast. Some central banks in advanced economies have given guidance of intended commencement of monetary policy normalization as monetary and fiscal policy across major advanced and emerging market economies have remained robust. This would constitute a further headwind to the full and inclusive recovery of the global economy due to the likely rise in cost of capital. The global economy is confronted with more headwinds than tailwinds, evidenced by the multitude of conflicting signals emerging from various major economies. Available data and forecasts for key macroeconomic variables for the Nigerian economy, suggest further rebound in output growth for the rest of the year. This will however be hinged on the continued stability in oil price and robust vaccination in Nigeria and across other countries. Foreign exchange market stability, further reduction in inflationary pressure in the economy and continued interventions by the monetary and fiscal authorities are very important factors to sustain the recovery momentum. Consequently the Nigerian economy is forecast to grow in 2021 by 286 per cent (CBN), 30 per cent (FGN) and 25 per cent (IMF). The Committee's Considerations The Committee noted the recovery in output growth and improving PMIs in the second quarter and urged the Bank to maintain the momentum of its current policy measures to sustain positive and inclusive real GDP growth. The increasing level of insecurity in parts of the country remained a crucial point of concern for the MPC as its persistence could adversely impact business 7 confidence and derail the recovery. It continued to call on the Federal Government to prioritize security surveillance in farming communities as the increased supply of food would play a significant role in stabilizing macroeconomic fundamentals. The Committee applauded the steady but moderate decline in domestic prices as inflation decelerated for the fifth consecutive month with forecast indicating a continued downward trend. The Committee also welcomed ongoing efforts towards revitalising the Nigeria Commodity Exchange (NCX) to improve the supply value chain, curtail the speculative activities of middlemen in the agricultural sector, and consequently drive down prices of key commodities such as paddy rice, maize, wheat and sorghum, amongst others. Members applauded the relentless effort by the Bank and other collaborators in ensuring the eventual take off of the Nigerian Infrastructure Corporation (INFRACORP), as this will improve the business environment, attract new investment and create new jobs in the Nigerian economy. The MPC further emphasised the importance of investment in transportation networks, power supply and telecommunication as these have a multiplier effect on other sectors of the economy. In addition to the INFRACORP initiative. Members urged the fiscal authority not to relent on other complementary infrastructure initiatives such as Public-Private-Partnerships and engagement of Nigeria's huge diaspora through the issuance of diaspora bonds to fund specific projects. The MPC noted the moderate improvement in the equities market and commended the sustained investor confidence in the Nigerian economy. The Committee however called on the Federal Government to continue to improve the ease of doing business in Nigeria to retain the current patronage of the Nigerian economy by foreign investors. Members applauded the continued resilience of the banking system, noting the progressive decline in the non-performing loans ratio, and broad improvement in all banking system parameters, despite the downside risks posed by the Pandemic to the smooth running of businesses. While the Committee was 8 cognizant of the credit risks associated with lending in the current economic climate, it urged Nigerian banks to extend more credit to businesses and consumers to facilitate a seamless recovery of output growth, reduce unemployment and stabilize prices. On the management of the exchange rate, the Committee applauded the Bank for improving foreign exchange supply in the economy to meet legitimate business and consumer demand. Members thus, urged the Bank to take further steps to restrict the activities of unauthorised and illegal dealers in the foreign exchange market, stating that all foreign exchange transactions must be conducted at the I&E window to ensure transparency and stability. The Committee, thus, called on the Bank to intensify surveillance over foreign exchange sales and utilisation by commercial banks and customers, to ensure that operators adhere to stipulated guidelines set by the CBN. The Bank thus, maintains its resolve to continue to restructure the foreign exchange market and will pursue all recent policies targeted at sanitizing the market to improve transparency and proper functioning to eliminate illegal foreign exchange dealers in the economy. On Government revenues, members urged the Federal Government to improve its tax collection in order to reduce its dependence on oil revenues and reduce its exposure to counter-cyclical shocks. The Committee emphasised the growing need to improve the agricultural value chain, particularly in key commodity products like cocoa, palm oil and cashew to diversify the country's export receipts. It therefore, called on the Bank to support manufacturing initiatives that could achieve this objective. The Committee applauded the Bank for its resilience and robust efforts in managing the downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation since the outbreak of the Pandemic, while charting a stable path for the economy to continue to expand its potential capacity through investment in infrastructure. Overall the MPC assessed the headwinds and tailwinds to growth, as well as, the upside risks to inflation, noting the immense effort by both the monetary and 9 fiscal authorities to achieve a substantial recovery in output growth and decrease in inflation. The Committee urged the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to intensify efforts toward procurement of more vaccines and the vaccination of more people to ensure that herd immunity is achieved. The Committee's Decision The MPC expressed delight at the robust recovery of output growth during the second quarter and the continued decline in inflation. Members however, re- iterated the need to put in place further measures to drive down inflation and improve real returns on investment. The MPC noted the unequivocal importance of credit growth to the sustained recovery of output and the moderation in price development as supply improves. It thus, called on the Bank to maintain adequate surveillance on banks to ensure compliance with its extant credit policy, while ensuring that they are not unduly exposed to credit risks. The Committee also noted the relevance of the Bank's suite of interventions to the overall system credit, urging its continued use to fund sectors with high employment-generating capacity. MPC weighed the pros and cons of tightening, holding or loosening the stance of policy, noting the impact on output growth, price development, unemployment and exchange rate. Members felt that tightening will contract the current level of system liquidity, and thus reduce demand pressure in the foreign exchange market, given that the current MPR at 115 per cent. CRR at 275 per cent and liquidity ratio at 300 per cent is already a tightening stance. This will, however, raise the cost of credit and reduce the volume of credit to the private sector. On loosening, the Committee felt that this would lower retail interest rates and improve the ability of obligors to repay their obligations, with a complementary reduction in NPLs. The gradual downward movement of inflation may, however, be compromised if policy accommodation is increased, leading to a further 10 widening of the negative real interest rate and thus exacerbating capital outflows as investment in naira denominated assets become less attractive. Members considered that a hold stance would allow the current recovery of output growth and decline in inflation to continue smoothly, thus gradually moving the economy to a sustainable path before adjustments are made to the stance of policy. Based on the above considerations, the MPC made the decision to hold all policy parameters constant; believing that a hold stance will enable the continued permeation of current policy measures in supporting the recorded growth recovery and macro-economic stability. The Committee thus decided by a unanimous vote to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 115 per cent. In summary, the MPC voted to: i. Retain the MPR at 115 per cent; ii. Retain the Asymmetric Corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; iii. Retain the CRR at 275 per cent; iv. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor.

Pakistan,2021-09-20,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement September 20, 2021. At its meeting on 20th September 2021, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the policy rate by 25 basis points to.25 percent. Since its last meeting in July, the MPC noted that the pace of the economic recovery has exceeded expectations. This robust recovery in domestic demand, coupled with higher international commodity prices, is leading to strong pick-up in imports and rise in the current account deficit. While year-on-year inflation has declined since June, rising demand pressures together with higher imported inflation could begin to manifest in inflation readings later in the fiscal year. With growing signs that the latest Covid wave in Pakistan remains contained, continued progress in vaccination, and overall deft management of the pandemic by the Government, the economic recovery now appears less vulnerable to pandemic-related uncertainty. As result, at this more mature stage of the recovery, greater emphasis is needed on ensuring the appropriate policy mix to protect the longevity of growth, keep inflation expectations anchored, and slow the growth in the current account deficit. In line with this shift in the economic outlook, the MPC was of the view that the priority of monetary policy also needed to gradually pivot from catalyzing the recovery after the Covid shock toward sustaining it. As foreshadowed in previous monetary policy statements, the MPC noted that this rebalancing would be best achieved by gradually tapering the significant monetary stimulus provided over the last 18 months. The MPC noted that over the last few months the burden of adjusting to the rising current account deficit had fallen primarily on the exchange rate and it was appropriate for other adjustment tools, including interest rates, to also play their due role. The MPC noted that the stance of monetary policy is still appropriately supportive of growth, with real interest rates remaining negative on forward-looking basis. Looking ahead, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the MPC expects monetary policy to remain accommodative in the near term, with possible further gradual tapering of stimulus to achieve mildly positive real interest rates over time. The pace of this possible further gradual tapering would be informed by updated information on the continued strength of demand growth and the stance of fiscal policy, amongst other factors. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Real sector. With supportive FY22 budget and accommodative monetary policy, most high-frequency domestic demand indicators such as automobiles. POL (petroleum, oil and lubricants) sales, cement sales and electricity generation continue to depict robust growth. This growth is mirrored in the strength of imports and tax collections. LSM registered strong growth in June (18. percent (y/y) before moderating in August to. percent (y/y), in line with typical seasonal patterns. The services sector is also rebounding strongly; latest Google Community Mobility Reports show that activity across grocery stores, restaurants, and shopping centers during July and August rose above pre-Covid levels. In agriculture, the decline in the area under cultivation of cotton is expected to be compensated by an increase in area for rice, maize, and sugarcane. Based on these trends, growth in FY22 is now expected toward the upper end of the forecast range of 4-5 Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN percent, notwithstanding some greater uncertainty with respect to spillovers from the evolving situation in Afghanistan. External sector. The current account deficit rose to $0. billion in July and $1. billion in August, reflecting both vigorous domestic demand and high global commodity prices. While remittances remained strong, growing by 10. percent (y/y) during July-August and exports also performed reasonably well (averaging $2. billion per month), they were outstripped by imports. In response, the rupee depreciated by. percent since the last MPC meeting. The MPC noted that many other currencies have also depreciated recently as expectations of tapering by the Federal Reserve have been brought forward. The MPC noted that the flexible market-based exchange rate regime has performed well since its introduction in June 2019, including through the Covid shock. It has overseen healthy modulation of the current account and supported critical build-up in the country's gross and net FX reserves despite external pressures. Under this regime, the SBP does not suppress an underlying trend in the exchange rate and any interventions are limited to address disorderly market conditions. Since its floatation, the rupee has moved in an orderly manner in both directions and has depreciated by only. percent to date, much less than many other emerging market currencies over the same period. Since the rupee was floated. SBP's gross foreign exchange reserves have nearly tripled to record $20 billion, while net international reserves have risen by nearly $16 billion between end-June 2019 and end-August 2021. The MPC observed that while the flexible exchange rate has appropriately played its role as shock absorber, it is important that its role be complemented by strong exports, targeted measures to curb non- essential imports, and appropriate macroeconomic policy settings to contain import growth. Fiscal sector. In FY21, prudent management of the public finances facilitated fiscal consolidation for the second year in row despite Covid, with the primary deficit declining by around percentage points to. percent of GDP. This improvement largely stemmed from strong growth in tax and petroleum development levy (PDL) revenues, together with significant deceleration in non-interest expenditures. Following the seasonal end-year release of expenditure allocations, the fiscal impulse was strongly expansionary in the final quarter of FY21. In the first two months of FY22. FBR revenue grew by over 40 percent (y/y) while Federal PSDP releases rose to an all-time high for this period, equivalent to nearly 4 percent of their budgeted amount for the full year. It will be important to support tax revenue growth and carefully monitor outturns through the year to ensure the budget remains on track. Any unforeseen slippages in the fiscal stance would further bolster domestic demand, imports and inflation. Monetary and inflation outlook 10. The MPC noted that accommodative financial conditions have provided significant support to the growth recovery since the start of FY21. Following historic cuts in the policy rate and the introduction of SBP Covid-related support packages, private sector credit grew by more than 1 percent during FY21, on the back of consumer loans (mainly auto finance and personal loans) followed by broad-based expansion in Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN credit for fixed investment and finally working capital loans. The MPC felt that some macroprudential tightening of consumer finance may also be appropriate to moderate demand growth as part of the move toward gradually normalizing monetary conditions. Inflation fell from. percent (y/y) in June to. percent in both July and August. In addition to favorable base effects, this decline reflects continued deceleration in administered prices of energy due to the reduction in PDL and sales tax on petroleum products. Core inflation also fell in both urban and rural areas in August. Nevertheless the momentum of prices remains relatively elevated, with month-on-month increases of. percent in July and. percent in August. In addition, inflation expectations of both households and businesses have drifted up and wage growth has picked up as the recovery has strengthened. Looking ahead, the inflation outlook largely depends on the path of domestic demand and administered prices, notably fuel and electricity, as well as global commodity prices. The MPC will continue to carefully monitor developments affecting medium-term prospects for inflation, financial stability and growth and stands ready to respond appropriately. Page."
Hungary,2021-09-21,"At its meeting on 21 September 2021, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 22 September 2021:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. Global economic recovery continued in the summer months, and in parallel, inflation rose. Where the reopening took place earlier an increase in consumer prices occurred faster as well. The fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic led to a renewed increase in risks surrounding the economic recovery. Consequently, international confidence indicators in manufacturing and services deteriorated in August. International risk appetite was driven by the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus, monetary policy messages of the world's leading central banks, and incoming macroeconomic data. Prices of several important commodities have risen in the past month, and as a result they remain significantly above pre-pandemic levels. Global oil prices rose overall in the period. The world's leading central banks maintained loose monetary conditions and continued their asset purchase programmes in the past month. The Federal Reserve maintained its monetary policy stance; however, based on communication by some decision-makers the possibility of modifying its crisis management programmes is approaching. Following its decision in September, the ECB announced that purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) would be made at a slower pace than in the previous two quarters. Several developed country central banks started to phase out their asset purchase programmes in the past months. In the region, central bank decision-makers generally indicated that they would stand ready to tighten monetary conditions, when necessary, due to an increase in the outlook for inflation. The Hungarian economy restarted successfully. GDP reached its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter. Hungary is among the economies in Europe showing the fastest recovery. Based on monthly data, strong economic recovery continued in the third quarter. A wide range of sectors contributed to growth, but there were differences in the pace of recovery. In July, construction and industrial production already exceeded pre-pandemic levels. The recovery in the domestic automobile industry has been held back by a global shortage in microchips; however, robust growth in battery manufacturing is becoming increasingly dominant in industrial production. The volume of retail sales continued to rise in July but fell still short of levels seen before the pandemic. Demand for market services increased significantly, which was also reflected in a strong expansion in household consumption. The unemployment rate fell further in July, and its level remained low in international comparison. Hungary's GDP will rise by between 6.5 and 7 percent in 2021 and by between 5 and 6 percent in 2022. In the favourable labour market environment, growth in household consumption is expected to continue, while a general pick-up in investment is likely to make a positive contribution to GDP growth from 2021 again. The investment rate will continue to rise before stabilising around 29 percent in the second half of the forecast horizon. Hungarian export performance rebounded strongly in 2021, and with the utilization of new export capacities built in previous years, it is expected to grow strongly over the entire forecast horizon. With the end of the year approaching, the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic is increasing risks to the economic outlook. In August 2021, annual inflation was 4.9 percent, and core inflation stood at 3.6 percent. Headline inflation rose by 0.3 percentage points and core inflation by 0.1 percentage point compared with the previous month. The rise in inflation was driven mainly by an increase in the inflation of fuel, industrial goods and unprocessed food. The effect of a global pick-up in commodity prices is causing inflation to accelerate in an increasingly wide range of industrial goods. In the summer, the significant monthly rise in market services stopped, suggesting that the vast majority of repricings related to the reopening may have already materialised. Inflation is expected to rise further in the autumn months and to stay above 5 percent during the remainder of the year. The gradual pass-through of increased commodity prices and freight costs into industrial goods prices is expected to be decisive in case of underlying inflation. Core inflation is expected to rise to close to 4 percent during the remainder of the year. The effects of the Bank's tightening cycle will be clearly felt in 2022. According to the Inflation Report projection, inflation will start to fall from the beginning of 2022 before returning to the central bank tolerance band in the second quarter. The consumer price index is expected to stabilise around the 3 percent central bank target in the second half of 2022. Some of the inflation risks, indicated in June, materialised in the summer months; however, risks to the outlook remain on the upside. The increase in commodity prices and freight costs continued; therefore, these factors continue to point to a higher external inflationary environment. Demand-supply frictions emerging temporarily, and the renewed tightening of labour market capacities in certain sectors, combined with dynamic wage growth carry upside risks to inflation. A more serious fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic than expected in the baseline projection and a stronger slowdown in the global economy indicate a lower inflation path. The government deficit, even with the September issuance of foreign currency denominated bonds, is expected to decline from 2021 and the debt-to-GDP to shift to a declining path. The current account balance is expected to improve over the forecast horizon, with a growing contribution from net exports due to new export capacities built up. The economy's net lending is likely to increase further and to stabilise around 3 percent of the GDP, and therefore Hungary's net external debt continues to fall. At its meeting today the Monetary Council decided to continue to tighten monetary conditions by applying several instruments. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the inflation outlook and the risks surrounding it clearly warrant the continuation of the ongoing, monthly interest rate tightening cycle. In addition to the tightening of interest rate conditions, the Monetary Council reduced further the target amount of weekly government securities purchases. Furthermore, the Council considered it necessary to gradually phase out the foreign-exchange swap facility providing forint liquidity and to tighten the liquidity provided by the instrument. According to the September decision, the central bank base rate rises by 15 basis points to 1.65 percent. The Monetary Council also considers a 15 basis point increase in the interest rate corridor to be justified: the overnight deposit rate increases to 0.70 percent, while the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates increase to 2.60 percent. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at weekly tenders. According to the Monetary Council's assessment, it is warranted to increase the interest rate on the one-week deposit instrument by the same measure as in the base rate. It remains a key priority for the MNB that short-term rates in every sub-market and at all times should develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. The MNB continues to actively use its swap facility providing euro liquidity at the end of the quarters. Accordingly, the Bank will hold a total of five tenders until the end of September. To the same end, the MNB gradually phases out its FX swap facility providing forint liquidity taking into account the developments in the swap market. The Monetary Council continues to gradually withdraw the government securities purchase programme while considering aspects of maintaining market stability. Accordingly, the target amount of the MNB's weekly purchases will decrease from HUF 50 billion to HUF 40 billion from the week starting on 27 September 2021. The Bank may depart from this arrangement in a flexible manner, depending on supply and other market conditions. Next time the Monetary Council will set the target amount of weekly purchases for the following quarter in December. In the Council's assessment, a stable liquidity position in the government securities market remains crucial from the perspective of monetary policy transmission. The MNB continues to use the government securities purchase programme taking a flexible approach to changing the quantity and structure of weekly purchases, to the extent and for the time necessary. If warranted by the maintenance of market stability, the MNB will stand ready to temporarily raise the volume of weekly purchases at any given time. The Bank will not sell the stock of government securities on its balance sheet, purchased government securities will be held to maturity. The Monetary Council is committed to maintaining price stability. In the decision-makers' assessment, the inflation outlook is surrounded by upside risks. According to the Inflation Report projection, inflation will follow a declining path from the beginning of 2022, while the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic points to an increase in the risks to economic recovery. These warrant a continuation of the monthly interest rate tightening cycle with lower pace. The Monetary Council will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes until the outlook for inflation stabilises around the central bank target in a sustainable manner and inflation risks become evenly balanced on the horizon of monetary policy."
Brazil,2021-09-22,"In its 241st meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate to 6.25% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Regarding the global outlook, there are two additional risk factors to the growth of emerging economies. First, reductions in forecasts for growth in Asian economies, reflecting the evolution of the Covid-19 Delta variant. Second, a tightening of monetary conditions in various emerging economies, as a reaction to recent inflation surprises. However, the long-lasting monetary stimuli and the reopening of major economies still sustain a favorable environment for emerging markets. The Committee continues to consider that a new round of market discussion regarding inflationary risks in advanced economies could result in a challenging environment for emerging economies. Turning to the Brazilian economy, the second quarter GDP release as well as the most recent indicators continue to show a positive evolution and do not ensue relevant revisions in growth forecasts, which display a robust economic recovery during the second half of the year. Consumer inflation remains high. Industrial goods price increases  due to higher input costs, supply restrictions, and redirecting of services demands towards goods  has not subsided and should remain a pressure in the short run. In addition, services inflation has accelerated in recent months, reflecting the gradual normalization of the sector, as expected. Finally, pressures persist in volatile components such as food and fuel prices and especially electricity fares, due to factors including the exchange rate, commodity prices, and adverse weather conditions. The various measures of underlying inflation are above the range compatible with meeting the inflation target. Inflation expectations for 2021, 2022, and 2023 collected by the Focus survey are around 8.3%, 4.1%, and 3.25%, respectively; and. The Copom's inflation projections in its baseline scenario, with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and exchange rate starting at USD/BRL 5.25* and evolving according to the purchase power parity (PPP), stand around 8.5% for 2021, 3.7% for 2022 and 3.2% for 2023. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that rises to 8.25% in 2021 and to 8.50% during 2022 and drops to 6.75% during 2023. In this scenario, inflation projections for administered prices are 13.7% for 2021, 4.2% for 2022 and 4.8% for 2023. The energy flag is assumed to be 'water scarcity' in December 2021 and 'red level 2' in December of 2022 and 2023. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, a possible reversion, even if partial, of the recent increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency would produce a lower-than-projected inflation in the baseline scenario. On the other hand, further extensions of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that increase aggregate demand and deteriorate the fiscal path may pressure the country's risk premium. In spite of the recent improvement of debt sustainability indicators, the elevated fiscal risk creates an upward asymmetry in the balance of risks, i.e., in the direction of higher-than-expected paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The Committee reiterates that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 1.00 p.p. to 6.25% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2022 and, to a lesser extent, 2023. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment. The Committee considers that, at the present stage of the tightening cycle, this pace is the most appropriate to guarantee inflation convergence to the target at the relevant horizon and, simultaneously, allow the Committee to obtain more information regarding the state of the economy and the persistence of shocks. At this moment, the Copom's baseline scenario and balance of risks indicate as appropriate to advance the process of monetary tightening further into the restrictive territory. For the next meeting, the Committee foresees another adjustment of the same magnitude. The Copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the achievement of the inflation target and will depend on the evolution of economic activity, on the balance of risks, and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fabio Kanczuk. Fernanda MagalhÃ£es Rumenos Guardado. JoÃ£o Manoel Pinho de Mello. MaurÃ­cio Costa de Moura. OtÃ¡vio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Sergio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Philippines,2021-09-22,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility at 2.0 percent. The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were likewise kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. Latest baseline forecasts indicate a higher inflation path over the policy horizon. Average inflation is seen to settle slightly above the upper end of the target band of 2-4 percent in 2021. This reflects the impact of recent supply disruptions on food prices, which contributed in part to the higher-than-expected inflation outturn in August. Nevertheless, inflation is projected to settle close to the midpoint of the target range in 2022 and 2023. Moreover, inflation expectations remain firmly aligned with the baseline projection path. At the same time, the risks to the inflation outlook have tilted towards the upside for the remaining months of 2021 but remains broadly balanced for 2022 and 2023. Upside risks may emanate from pressures on international commodity prices amid improving global demand and lingering supply-chain bottlenecks. The potential effects of weather disturbances and a possible prolonged recovery from the African Swine Fever (ASF) outbreak could also continue to lend upside pressures on prices. Meanwhile, downside risks are seen from the spread of more contagious coronavirus variants, as potential delays in the lifting of containment measures could further dampen prospects for global growth and domestic demand. The Monetary Board also noted that the outlook for recovery continues to hinge on timely measures to prevent deeper negative effects on the Philippine economy. To this end, the acceleration of the Government's vaccination program and a recalibration of existing quarantine protocols will be crucial in supporting economic activity while safeguarding public health and welfare. On balance, the Monetary Board is of the view that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriate given the manageable inflation environment and uncertain growth outlook. The Monetary Board reiterates that, together with appropriate fiscal and health interventions, keeping a steady hand on the BSP's policy levers will allow the momentum of economic recovery to gain more traction by helping boost domestic demand and market confidence. Going forward, the BSP will continue to closely monitor evolving conditions for any threats to the inflation target. The BSP stands ready to take appropriate measures as necessary to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains in line with its price and financial stability mandates."
United States,2021-09-22,"EDT September 22, 2021 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the rise in COVID-19 cases has slowed their recovery. Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remain. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to - maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT September 22, 2021assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its - maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals. If progress continues broadly as expected, the Committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C. Williams. Vice Chair; Thomas I Barkin; Raphael W Bostic; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H Clarida; Mary C Daly; Charles L Evans; Randal K. Quarles; and Christopher J Waller."
Turkiye,2021-09-23,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 19 percent to 18 percent. Worldwide speeding up of vaccination rollout, especially in developed countries, supports the global economic recovery. Nonetheless, despite the increase in the vaccination rate, new variants keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive. Strong recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. Unfavorable effects of weather conditions in major agricultural commodity exporting countries are observed on global food prices. While the effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation would be mostly temporary along with normalization in demand composition, easing of supply constraints and waning base effects. Accordingly, central banks in advanced economies continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs. Leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong in the third quarter, with the help of robust external demand. The acceleration of domestic vaccination rollout facilitates the recovery in services, tourism and related sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. Favorable external demand conditions and current tight monetary policy impact the current account balance positively. The current account is expected to post a surplus in the rest of the year due to the strong upward trend in exports, and the strong progress in the vaccination program stimulating tourism activities. The improvement in the current account balance is important for the price stability objective. Recent increase in inflation has been driven by supply side factors such as rise in food and import prices and supply constraints, increase in administered prices and demand developments due to the reopening. It is assessed that these effects are due to transitory factors. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is being observed. The tightness in monetary stance has started to have a higher than envisaged contractionary effect on commercial loans. In addition, macroprudential policy framework has been strengthened to curb personal loan growth. The Committee evaluated the analyses to decompose the impact of demand factors that monetary policy can have an effect, core inflation developments and supply shocks. Accordingly it is judged that a revision in monetary policy stance is needed and the policy rate was decided to be reduced. The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2021-09-23,"PRESS STATEMENT 23 September 2021 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank A steady improvement in vaccination rates will sustain confidence and global economic growth, even with expected further waves of the Covid-19 virus. However vaccination rates are lagging in many emerging market and developing economies. Until populations develop sufficient immunity to curb virus transmission, waves of infection are likely to continue, with ongoing poor economic outcomes. At this time, the third wave of the virus infection has peaked in South Africa. The virus however is only one of a series of current risks to the economic recovery that include rising inflation, weaker commodity export prices, and the longer term impact of scarring from the pandemic and the July unrest. The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) forecast for global gross domestic product (GDP) for 2021 is 6.0%, and will be updated again in early October. The SARB's MPC Statement 23 September 2021 Page 1. The SARB's MPC Statement 23 September 2021 Page 1 forecast for global growth in 2021 now sits at 6.2% (up from 6.1%).1 For 2022 and 2023, we still expect global growth of 4.4%, and 3.4%, respectively. Recoveries in emerging market and developing economies are expected to lag those in advanced economies, in large part due to a slower pace of vaccinations. Although policy settings in advanced economies remain accommodative, the spread of the Delta variant, higher global inflation, and uncertainty about the normalisation path for interest rates continue to cause financial market turmoil and capital flow volatility. Risk aversion persists where economies fail to take advantage of improved global prospects or to reduce large macroeconomic imbalances. The domestic economy grew by 4.2% in the first quarter of 2021 and by 4.7% in the second quarter. These outcomes reflect better sectoral growth performances and robust terms of trade. Commodity prices have been extraordinarily high, sustaining income gains despite somewhat higher oil prices. While more South Africans have re-entered the jobs market as economic activity resumed, the loss of jobs suggests persistent adjustment and sustained weakness in some sectors. Household spending remains healthy, however, in line with better than expected salaries and wages, rising asset prices and low interest rates. The Bank's forecast for fixed investment was revised up for this year but remains constrained, and, as a result of the GDP revisions by Stats SA, is lower as a share of economic activity.2 1 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. The IMF's July World Economic Outlook global forecast for 2022 sits at 4.9%. 2 Statistics South Africa released its revision on 25th August 2021. The main effect of the revisions is to the aggregate level of output in the economy, which was revised up significantly. MPC Statement 23 September 2021 Page 2. MPC Statement 23 September 2021 Page 2 We expect the economy to grow by an upwardly revised 5.3% this year (from 4.2%), despite the much larger negative effect on output than was previously estimated from the July unrest. Our revised estimate for third quarter economic growth is -1.2%, compared to the previous -0.5%. Output in the manufacturing sector fell by 8.0% in July alone. Mining was up 4.1%, while land freight transport fell by 5.0% and retail output was down by 11.2%. The July events and the pandemic are likely to have lasting effects on investor confidence and job creation, impeding recovery in labour-intensive sectors hardest hit by the lockdowns. Overall, and after revisions, the risks to the medium-term domestic growth outlook are assessed to be balanced, as most of the bounceback from the recovery is now in the past. High export prices are expected to fade, while very weak job creation will slow household consumption. Investment will remain constrained by the still limited energy supply and ongoing policy uncertainty. The faster vaccine rollout presents upside risks to the growth outlook. The current account surplus remains large, at 5.6% of GDP, reflecting high prices for mining and agricultural exports, still gradually rising oil prices, and slowly reviving demand for imported consumer and investment goods. The surplus is expected to shrink to about 0.7% of GDP for next year (2022), as exports slow and imports accelerate.3 3 The current account is expected to be in surplus of 4.7% of GDP in 2021, shifting to a deficit of -0.3% in 2023. MPC Statement 23 September 2021 Page 3. MPC Statement 23 September 2021 Page 3 Long bond yields have returned to pre-pandemic levels of around 9.0% on 10-year bonds. Although financing conditions have improved and fiscal risk has eased, the yield curve for rand-denominated bonds remains steep. The generally favourable global conditions and strong commodity export prices have strengthened the currency above its long-run equilibrium level, with a year to date appreciation of 1.5% on a trade-weighted basis. Since the July meeting, the rand has depreciated by 1%. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R14.47 to the US dollar, compared with R14.40 at the time of the previous meeting. At a global level, a wide range of prices is accelerating, including raw materials, intermediate inputs and food. This reflects both global supply shortages and strong demand. This has passed-through to consumer prices in some major economies. Our estimate for inflation in the G3 was revised higher for 2021 to 2.4% (from 2.2%) and remains the same in the outer years.4 Oil prices are revised up for this year, and petrol price inflation is higher at 16.1% (up from 15.3%).5 Local electricity prices are lower at 10.1% (down from 10.5%). Headline consumer price inflation for 2021 is revised slightly higher to 4.4% (up from 4.3%), and remains unchanged at 4.2% in 2022 and 4.5% in 2023. The forecast for core inflation is revised higher to 3.0% in 2021 (up from 2.9%) and to 3.8% in 2022 (up from 3.7%). Core inflation is expected to be 4.3% in 2023, unchanged from the July forecast. 4 The G3 comprises the United States, the Eurozone, and Japan. 5 The forecast for petrol prices in 2022 are revised down from 5.5% in July to 3.7% currently. Our assumptions are now for oil prices to average $69 per barrel in 2021 and $67 per barrel in 2022 and $65 in 2023. MPC Statement 23 September 2021 Page 4. MPC Statement 23 September 2021 Page 4 The Bank's forecast reflects higher headline inflation for the rest of this year, before moderating in 2022. Compared to the July meeting, and taking into account higher household consumption and less investment from the recent GDP revisions, the output gap is narrower historically and over the forecast period.6 While economic activity continues to expand over the forecast period, a rise in core inflation is moderated by the current strength of the exchange rate and modest unit labour costs. The risks to the short-term inflation outlook are assessed to the upside. Rapid global producer price and food price inflation have surprised to the upside in recent months and could do so again. Oil prices have become more volatile in recent weeks and could rise beyond our expectations. Electricity and other administered prices also continue to present short-term risks. Given the medium and long-term projections set out above, a weaker currency, higher domestic import tariffs, and escalating wage demands present further longer-term upside risks to the inflation forecast. Average surveyed expectations of future inflation remain unchanged at 4.2% for 2021 and 4.4% for 2022. Market-based expectations for inflation are slightly higher for 2021 at 4.4% (up from 4.3%) and stable over longer horizons.7 6 The GDP revisions resulted in a higher level of output, consumption and lower investment, among other changes. Upward revisions to potential growth were not as large as the GDP level revisions, implying somewhat higher demand and therefore a smaller output gap than estimated pre-revision. For 2020, the output revisions also implied more of a negative supply shock than previously estimated, which then reversed in 2021, resulting in re-estimates of the output gap for each of these years. 7 The (Q3) Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey expectations remain unchanged at 4.2%, 4.4% and to 4.5% for the three years. Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) in September expect inflation to be higher at 4.4% (from 4.3%) in 2021, and unchanged at 4.4% in 2022, and lower at 4.2% in 2023. Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These now sit at 4.79% for the 5-year and 5.98% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year breakeven inflation sits at 6.31%. MPC Statement 23 September 2021 Page 5. MPC Statement 23 September 2021 Page 5 With largely unchanged inflation expectations and even with continued upside risks, the Committee expects inflation to stay close to the mid-point over the forecast period. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep rates unchanged at 3.5% per annum. The implied policy rate path of the Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) indicates an increase of 25 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2021 and further increases in each quarter of 2022 and 2023. These repurchase rate levels reflect a highly accommodative policy stance through the end of the forecast, keeping financial conditions supportive of credit demand as the economy continues to recover.8 The Bank has ensured adequate liquidity in domestic markets and will continue to closely monitor funding markets for stress. In addition, regulatory relief provided to banks continues to support lending to households and firms. Better anchored expectations of future inflation could keep interest rates lower for longer, and can be realised by achieving a stable public debt level, increasing the supply of energy, moderating administered price inflation and keeping wage inflation low into the recovery. Such steps will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy. Economic and financial conditions are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. In this uncertain environment, policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. The MPC will seek to 8 This implies a rise in the inflation-adjusted repo rate from -1.0% for 2021 to about 0.6% for 2022 and 1.5% for 2023. The real repurchase rate calculation here is based on the 1-quarter ahead inflation forecast. MPC Statement 23 September 2021 Page 6.

Thailand,2021-09-29,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 6/2021 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 29 September 2021 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent. The Committee assessed that the Thai economy in 2021 and 2022 would expand close to the projection from the previous meeting, but uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook remained high. Nonetheless progress on vaccination and earlier-than-expected relaxation of the containment measures would help support the economy in the period ahead. The most important issue for the Thai economy at present was the implementation of public health measures that would help facilitate the economic and income recovery. The Committee viewed that government measures should be expedited to support the economic recovery. Despite some progress on financial measures, liquidity distribution and debt restructuring should be expedited further for those who were affected. The Committee viewed that financial measures would be more effective than a further reduction in the policy rate, which was already low, and thus voted to maintain the policy rate. The Thai economy was projected to expand 07 and 39 percent in 2021 and 2022 respectively, largely unchanged from the August projection. Although the economy in the third quarter of 2021 was affected by the containment measures and a slowdown in exports, significant progress on vaccination and earlier-than-expected relaxation of the containment measures would help restore private sector confidence and boost private consumption for the rest of 2021. The economy in 2022 would gradually recover mainly owing to domestic spending in tandem with improving confidence. Foreign tourist figures were expected to recover slowly, while merchandise exports would continue to be affected by shortages of containers and semiconductors. The labor market improved from higher income of workers in the services sector and the self-employed in line with economic acitivities. Headline inflation would remain subdued in line with weak domestic demand. Nonetheless headline inflation forecast and medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target. The Thai economy would still be highly uncertain. Thus there remained a need to monitor the development in the outbreak and relaxation of containment measures, private sector confidence, as well as the momentum of government measures as these factors would affect the economic recovery going forward. Despite ample overall liquidity, the distribution of liquidity remained uneven due to increased credit risks, particularly among SMEs and households. Nonetheless the special loan facility for businesses helped enhance credit access for SMEs. On exchange rates, the baht relative to the US dollar exhibited more volatile movements owing to developments of monetary policy in advanced economies and uncertainties in the Thai economic recovery outlook. The Committee 2 would closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem. The Committee viewed that the government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery. Public health measures should strike a balance between containing the outbreak and supporting the recovery of economic activities and income. Fiscal measures should help facilitate the economic recovery by emphasizing on generating income and preparing measures to raise potential growth. Monetary policy must contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions overall. Financial and credit measures should be expedited to distribute liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner and help reduce debt burden. These measures included the special loan facility, asset warehousing scheme, and other measures by specialized financial institutions (SFIs). In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers' long-term debt serviceability. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery. In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook, namely implementation and relaxation of the domestic containment measures as well as the adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures. The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary."
Colombia,2021-09-30,"YouTube live broadcast (Only in Spanish). The board voted 4-3 to raise the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.0%; the three dissenting board members voted for a 50-basis point increase. This decision was based on the following considerations. A recovery in economic activity that was interrupted by roadblocks and a third wave of COVID-19 in the second quarter was restored in the third quarter. A strengthening of demand both domestically and among Colombia's major trade partners would be expected to encourage economic dynamism over the rest of the year, with GDP growth now projected at 8.6% in 2021 and 3.9% in 2022. The higher-than-expected forecasts suggest that excess productive capacity could be closed more quickly than previously anticipated. Annual inflation continued on an upward trajectory in August, reaching 4.4%; core inflation (CPI excluding food and regulated items) reached 2.3%. The increase can be explained in large part by domestic and international supply shocks that are expected to be transitory but whose durations may vary. The partial reversion of some price relief measures, amid more dynamic demand and a reduction in excess capacity, would also be a factor. The persistence of external shocks, indexation to higher inflation rates on some prices, and a faster-than-expected closure of the output gap have led the technical staff to revise its inflation forecasts upward to 4.5% for the end of 2021 and 3.5% for the end of 2022. Expected inflation has increased, though in the medium term remains close to the target. The increased persistence of supply shocks and their upward effects on prices could distance expectations from the target rate. The more positive performance of demand relative to supply has been reflected in an increase in the current account deficit, which according to the technical staff's most recent estimates will reach 5.0% of GDP at the end of 2021, higher than the 3.6% deficit in 2020. This can be explained in large part by a greater trade imbalance on goods and services associated with a significant increase in imports compared to exports. Capital flows, including foreign investment, will provide the primary source of financing, underlining the importance of macroeconomic stability. In reviewing the balance of risks the board of directors was cognizant of the significant amount of uncertainty surrounding these forecasts, as well as of the remaining risk of the COVID-19 pandemic once again worsening and affecting recovery in domestic and international demand. The board also recognized the risk of deviation in expected inflation compared to the target becoming a persistent phenomenon that could lead to indexation at higher rates of inflation.

Czech Republic,2021-09-30,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank increased the two-week repo rate by 75 basis points to 1.50%. At the same time, it increased the discount rate to 0.50% and the Lombard rate to 2.50%. Five members voted in favour of this decision and two members voted for leaving rates unchanged. . This decision of the Bank Board is underpinned by the summer macroeconomic forecast and by an assessment of information obtained since it was prepared. Consistent with the forecast is a rise in market interest rates from the middle of this year onwards. The Bank Board assessed the risks and uncertainties of the summer forecast as being markedly inflationary and hence requiring a faster rise in interest rates compared with the current forecast. The pace of further tightening of monetary policy will be conditional on future developments and on the message of the autumn forecast. The current outlook for foreign industrial producer price inflation has been revised markedly upwards, especially for the near future. This is due to persisting disruptions to material and component supplies and high global demand for the production of the industrial sector. Along with rising prices of electricity and gas on commodity exchanges, this will also lead to an increase in the outlook for consumer price inflation this year and the next. Expected GDP growth in the effective euro area is slightly higher this year. The outlook for still low foreign interest rates is unchanged. The outlooks for the Brent crude oil price and the euro-dollar exchange rate also remain almost unchanged from the assumptions of the current forecast. So far in Q3, domestic inflation has been visibly above the 3% upper boundary of the tolerance band around the CNB's inflation target. Annual consumer price inflation was higher than forecasted in July and accelerated significantly further in August, exceeding the forecast by one percentage point. The main factor underlying this was a further unexpected strong rise in core inflation. It was due primarily to increasing growth in the cost of owner-occupied housing and rising prices in the reopened services sector. However, goods prices, including food prices, also accelerated. Fuel prices continued to rise apace year on year, in line with the forecast. Administered price inflation remained subdued, but the current forecast expects it to rise sharply in the autumn on the back of increasing prices of electricity and natural gas for households. According to the summer forecast, inflation will return towards the 2% target next year, aided by this year's tightening of monetary conditions. However, there are significant upside risks to this inflation outlook, especially for the next few quarters, as newly available information points to unexpectedly strong inflation pressures from the domestic and foreign economy. The Czech economy returned to growth in Q2. This was due mainly to an easing of most pandemic measures. The pace of economic recovery lagged only slightly behind the CNB's forecast. The deviation was due almost exclusively to a smaller contribution of net exports. The worse export performance stems from the overloading of global production and supply chains, which led to forced restrictions of the output of Czech industry. Government consumption was also slightly lower than forecasted, despite still recording solid growth. By contrast, household consumption was well above the forecast. Gross capital formation was also slightly higher, due almost exclusively to higher additions to inventories. According to the current forecast, the Czech economy will grow by 3.5% this year and pick up slightly further next year. Industrial production growth slowed further in July. This was due to labour shortages and the above disruptions to material and component supplies, which are also fostering a rapid rise in prices of industrial production inputs and outputs. Growth in retail sales also slowed in July, but it remains high despite a slight decrease in sales in the automotive segment. Growth in construction output remains muted. The labour market, which did not cool too much during the pandemic, has started to show clear signs of renewed overheating in recent months. Unemployment has been falling faster than forecasted in recent months, and the reopened services sector has been facing frequent shortages of skilled employees. Wage growth lagged slightly behind the forecast in Q2, owing to somewhat lower wage growth in market sectors. However, this was partly offset by slightly higher-than-expected wage growth in non-market sectors. The koruna-euro exchange rate was almost as forecasted on average in JulySeptember. The koruna started to appreciate gradually in early September on market expectations that the interest rate differential would widen more significantly than previously expected. According to the current forecast, the koruna will continue to firm gradually, strengthening beyond CZK 25 to the euro in late 2021 and early 2022. The summer forecast was drawn up in an environment of still elevated risks and uncertainties. To sum up its materialisation, economic growth and average wage growth lagged only slightly behind the forecast in Q2. The share of unemployed persons was somewhat lower during the summer months than in the current forecast. By contrast, inflation was markedly higher in August. In this context, we can already state now that our autumn forecast will contain a sizeable increase in the inflation outlook, especially in the short run."
Mexico,2021-09-30,"Global economic activity continued to recover, although at a slower pace and heterogeneously across countries, associated with vaccine availability, the evolution of the pandemic, and spending programs. Global inflation continued increasing due to pressures on commodity prices, base effects, bottlenecks in production, and to stimulus spending and its recomposition towards merchandise. The central banks of the main advanced economies have maintained the monetary accommodation, although some of them are already expecting to diminish it, while those of several emerging economies continue reducing it. Among key global risks are those associated with the pandemic, inflationary pressures, and adjustments in monetary and financial conditions. In domestic financial markets, the volatility of the peso exchange rate and interest rates have increased. The recovery of the Mexican economy continued during the third quarter and is expected to endure for the rest of the year and 2022. Uncertainty about the pandemic persists and slack conditions are anticipated, with significant differences across sectors. Global inflationary pressures and bottlenecks in production continue affecting headline and core inflation, which during the first fortnight of September registered annual variations of 5.87% and 4.92%, respectively. Headline and core inflation expectations for 2021 increased again, those for the next 12 months and for 2022 also rose, while those for longer terms have remained stable at levels above the target. Headline and core inflation forecasts were revised upwards compared to those previously released (see table). Considering the nature of the shocks that have affected them, the larger increases correspond to the short term. Annual headline and core inflation projections are expected to decrease, particularly for one year and beyond, and to converge to the 3% target by the end of the forecast horizon. These forecasts are subject to risks. On the upside: external inflationary pressures; cost-related pressures; core inflation persistence; exchange rate depreciation; and increases in agricultural and livestock product prices. On the downside: a widening of the negative output gap; additional social distancing; and exchange rate appreciation. The balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon is biased to the upside. Although the shocks that have increased inflation are expected to be transitory, due to their variety, magnitude, and the extended horizon over which they have affected it, they may pose risks to the price formation process and to inflation expectations. In order to avoid such risks, it was deemed necessary to reinforce the monetary policy stance by adjusting it to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to 1 its 3% target within the forecast horizon. The Governing Board decided to increase the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.75%. For the next monetary policy decisions, the Governing Board will assess the factors that have an incidence on the foreseen trajectory for inflation and its expectations, in order for the policy rate to be consistent at all times with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates, enabling an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets. Voting in favor of the decision were Alejandro DÃ­az de LeÃ³n. Irene Espinosa. Galia Borja and Jonathan Heath. Voting in favor of leaving the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 4.50% was Gerardo Esquivel. 2/ Forecast as of August 2021. Quarterly Report April - June 2021.

Romania,2021-10-05,"The Board of the National Bank of Romania, having convened for the meeting of 5 October 2021, decided:. The annual inflation rate went up to 4.95 percent in July from 3.94 percent in June, while in August it reached 5.25 percent, exceeding significantly the upper bound of the variation band of the target and running mildly above the forecast. The increase was driven almost entirely, during this period too, by exogenous CPI components, particularly by the considerable hike in natural gas and electricity prices in July and, to a lower extent, by the further rise in fuel prices, mainly on account of the non-petrol-diesel subgroup. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate went up to 3.0 percent in July, from 2.9 percent in June, and to 3.2 percent in August, thus coming slightly above the forecast. Its evolution reflects primarily the effects of the rising prices of some commodities, including agri-food items, and higher energy and transport costs, as well as the influences of the increased demand for goods and services, overlapping those of supply-side constraints, alongside the upward adjustments of short-term inflation expectations. Average annual CPI inflation rate and average annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices climbed to 3.3 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively in August, from 2.9 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively in June 2021. Economic activity continued to expand in 2021 Q2, at a relatively slower quarterly pace (1.8 percent compared to 2.5 percent in Q1), but somewhat brisker than anticipated, moderately exceeding its pre-pandemic level. The evolution makes it likely for the aggregate demand surplus to increase during this period in line with the latest medium-term forecast. At the same time, amid the base effect associated with the sharp economic contraction in the same year-earlier period, the annual growth rate of economic activity went up to 13.0 percent in Q2 from -0.2 percent in Q1. All major aggregate demand components contributed to the abrupt pick-up in annual GDP dynamics, albeit to a considerably different extent. The main determinant was private consumption  whose advance was however lower than expected in annual terms  its contribution being closely followed by the change in inventories. A positive contribution, albeit much more modest, was made by gross fixed capital formation, in the context of renewed markedly faster growth in new construction works, mainly on account of residential construction works, which outweighed the impact of the notable decline in the dynamics of net investment in equipment (including transport equipment). Furthermore, the negative contribution of net exports to annual GDP dynamics decreased in Q2, given that the sharply faster change in exports of goods and services, also amid a base effect, outpaced that in imports thereof. The widening of the trade deficit accelerated however in annual terms, while the annual dynamics of the current account deficit slowed down considerably versus Q1, under the impact of a relative improvement in income balances, remaining nevertheless above the average values recorded in 2019 and 2020. According to the recent developments in high-frequency indicators, the economy saw a slightly faster quarterly increase in Q3, but solely on account of much better agricultural performance, which, in the context of the base effect associated with the strong rebound in the same year-earlier period, implied a modest decline in the annual GDP dynamics. It is worth mentioning that the annual dynamics of retail trade, the motor vehicles and motorcycles segment and market services to households stayed at an elevated level in July, yet considerably lower than in Q2. Industrial output and the new orders in manufacturing reported, however, a markedly slower increase against the same year-earlier period, while the construction activity saw a mild drop in annual terms. Turning to exports of goods and services, their annual change declined significantly in July, much more swiftly than that of imports, which triggered a fast acceleration in the annual increase in trade deficit. Against this background, the current account deficit continued to widen, exceeding January through July overall by more than 70 percent the level recorded in the same year-ago period. Looking at the financial market, key interbank money market rates remained in July close to their nearly four-year lows, before posting upward adjustments in August and especially September, amid the relative tightening of liquidity conditions, but also the consolidation of expectations on a policy rate hike in the near future. Against this backdrop, as well as following global financial market developments, yields on government securities witnessed a steeper upward path in the latter part of Q3, particularly for the medium and long maturities. At the same time, the EUR/RON exchange rate saw a relatively fast correction of the decline recorded in the first part of Q3 under the influence of seasonal factors, and then continued to trend moderately upwards, inter alia amid the interest rate differential and heightening tensions on the domestic political scene. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector climbed more firmly in the two-digit range during the first two months of 2021 Q3, averaging out at 12.7 percent from 9.8 percent in Q2, due to the unprecedented step-up of lending in local currency in July, including with the support of government programmes, but also to the moderate pick-up in the dynamics of foreign currency credit. Hence, the leu-denominated component saw its pace of increase accelerate further, to a five-year high of 17.4 percent July through August, from 15.2 percent in Q2, its share in total private sector credit widening to 71.3 percent in August. The current assessments indicate the outlook for the annual inflation rate to rise over the short time horizon to significantly higher values than those anticipated previously, under the impact of supply-side shocks. Determining factors are the renewed large hikes anticipated for energy prices, particularly of natural gas, owing to the surge in domestic and European wholesale prices and, to a smaller extent, in fuel prices, mainly on the back of the non-petrol-diesel component. They are conducive to a larger and protracted positive deviation of the annual inflation rate from the upper bound of the variation band of the target, while subsequently generating significant disinflationary base effects. The fourth pandemic wave and the related containment measures pose increased uncertainties and risks to the forecasts, at least in the near run, given the quick worsening of the health situation and the very low level of vaccination on the domestic front, with a potential negative impact on labour market developments as well, which were obviously improving until recently. Significant uncertainties and risks also stem, however, from the future fiscal policy stance, given especially the coordinates of the recent budget revision and the potential protraction of domestic political instability, likely to jeopardise budget consolidation  vital for macroeconomic stability. A source of uncertainties and risks remains the absorption of European funds, especially those under the Next Generation EU programme. Important from this perspective is the completion of the approval of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, as well as of the legal and technical procedures underlying the commitment of funds. In addition, significant risks are further posed by developments in commodity prices, particularly of energy and agri-food, as well as by bottlenecks in production and supply chains, likely to accelerate global inflation. In the meeting held today, 5 October 2021, based on the currently available data and assessments, and in light of the elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 1.50 percent per annum, from 1.25 percent per annum, as of 6 October 2021, while maintaining firm control over money market liquidity; moreover, it decided to raise the deposit facility rate to 1.00 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 2.00 percent per annum. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to bring back and maintain the annual inflation rate in line with the 2.5 percent Â±1 percentage point flat inflation target, inter alia via the anchoring of inflation expectations over the longer time horizon, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth in the context of the fiscal consolidation process, while safeguarding financial stability. The NBR closely monitors developments in the domestic and international environment and stands ready to use the tools at its disposal to achieve the fundamental objective of price stability in the medium term. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during todayâs meeting will be posted on the NBRâs website on 15 October 2021 at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 9 November 2021."
Poland,2021-10-06,"Warsaw, 6 October 2021 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 6 October 2021 The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.4 percentage points, i.e. to 0.50%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: âª lombard rate at 1.00%; âª deposit rate at 0.00%; âª rediscount rate at 0.51%; âª discount rate at 0.52%. Moreover, the Council decided to increase the required reserve ratio from 0.5% to 2.0%. The activity in global economy continues to recover, yet an increase in the number of infections observed in recent months together with supply-side constraints in some markets, has contributed to the weaker activity growth in some economies in Q3. The global commodity prices  in particular that of natural gas, but also oil and some agricultural commodities  have risen markedly in the recent period and are now much higher than a year ago. Together with supply-side constraints in some markets and fast growth in prices of international transport, it has contributed in recent months to significant increase in inflation in many economies. Nevertheless, major central banks are keeping interest rates low while continuing asset purchases. In Poland, economic activity continues to recover. In August, the annual growth of retail sales, industrial production and of construction and assembly output have picked up. At the same time, supply-side constraints in some markets are weighing on business sentiment in the manufacturing sector. Even though the average employment in the enterprise sector has been still somewhat below the pre-pandemic level, the situation in the labour market is improving which is reflected in substantial average wage growth in this sector. In the coming quarters, economic conditions are expected to remain favourable, although there is still an uncertainty regarding an impact of autumn wave of the epidemic on the economic activity. Inflation in Poland, according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate for September 2021, increased to 5.8% in annual terms, and in monthly terms it amounted to 0.6%. The elevated 1/2 inflation resulted, to a great extent, from factors beyond the control of domestic monetary policy, such as higher than a year ago global prices of energy and agricultural commodities, earlier increase in electricity prices and in waste disposal charges, as well as disruptions in global supply chains and international transport. The ongoing economic recovery, including rising household income, has also added to the price growth. Even though the impact of some supply-side factors currently increasing inflation will fade next year, the rise in global prices of both energy and agricultural commodities observed in recent months may still increase price growth in the coming quarters. Amidst probable further economic recovery and favourable labour market conditions, inflation may remain elevated longer than hitherto expected. Such a situation would generate a risk of inflation staying above inflation target in the medium term. In order to decrease the inflation to NBP target in the medium term, the Council decided to increase NBP interest rates. Moreover NBP may still intervene in the foreign exchange market and use other instruments envisaged in the Monetary Policy Guidelines. The timing and scale of the measures taken by NBP will depend on the market conditions."
Israel,2021-10-07,"The fourth wave of the COVID-19 virus in Israel is abating. The economy's handling of this morbidity wave did not include serious restrictions on activity. However, there is still a great extent of uncertainty regarding economic activity in the medium term, mainly in view of the risk of cyclicality of additional morbidity waves. The available indicators of economic activity show that even at the peak of morbidity during the fourth wave, there was no significant decline in activity or in demand. The Research Department revised its staff forecast upward. Its assessment is that GDP will grow by 7 percent in 2021, and by 5.5 percent in 2022. Labor Force Survey data for the first half of September indicate stability in the unemployment rate. The number of job vacancies continued to increase, further to the trend since the beginning of the year, and the shortage of workers continues to weigh on the expansion of activity. The upward trend in inflation continues. Inflation in the past 12 months is 2.2 percent. One-year inflation expectations from all sources increased, and are within the target range. According to the various forecasts, the pace of inflation is expected to moderate later on. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel weakened by 0.5 percent against the dollar. The shekel strengthened by 1.1 percent against the euro, and by 0.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Home prices increased by about 8 percent in the past 12 months, a more rapid pace than in previous years. The pace ofincrease in rental prices remained relatively moderate. There is a prolonged marked decline in building completions. The global economy continues to recover in view of the moderating morbidity rates and the increase in vaccination rates. However, it seems that momentum has weakened due to difficulties in the global production chain and the increase in energy prices that are increasing existing inflation risks. Some of the central banks have started to gradually reduce their monetary accommodation. The Israeli economy's process of recovery from the crisis continues. However, there are still challenges to economic activity. The Committee will therefore continue to conduct an accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time. Continued economic activity and sound growth will make it possible to end the various quantitative easing programs in the coming months. This is all in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy targets and the recovery of the economy from the crisis, and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, click here. The fourth wave of the COVID-19 virus in Israel is abating, with a decline in morbidity rates, contagion coefficients, and the number of seriously ill patients. The economy dealt with this wave differently than with previous ones, and the process did not include severe restrictions on activity. This was made possible partly due to the vaccinations, and it seems that the third (booster) shot of the vaccine is also having a positive effect. The ability to conduct on-going economic activity alongside the COVID-19 virus can also be seen in the encouraging economic growth data. However, there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding economic activity in the medium term, mainly in view of the risk of cyclicality of additional waves of morbidity. The available indicators of economic activity show that despite the increase in morbidity, there was no significant decline in activity or in demand. Total credit card purchases declined moderately in August, following the expansion of restrictions, but increased again, rapidly, in September (Figure 4). There was a significant increase in purchases in the restaurants and domestic tourism industries (Figure 5). According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, the total net balance of the business sector in September declined slightly, but remained at a high positive level (Figure 2).Goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds, in dollars) declined slightly in August, but remained higher than they were prior to the crisis. Services exports continued to trend upward (Figure 6). Goods imports also continued to trend upward, and are at high levels in all components (Figure 7). The Bank of Israel Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast. Its assessment is that GDP will grow by 7 percent in 2021, and by 5.5 percent in 2022 (Figure 1). The adjusted employment rate will increase throughout the forecast period, to 59.5 percent at the end of 2022. The broad unemployment rate is expected to be about 5.2 percent atthe end of the period, compared with an average level of 3.8 percent in 2019. The inflation rate is expected to be 2.5 percent in 2021, but looking at the next four quarters, inflation is expected to gradually moderate to 1.7 percent. In addition, assuming that the State budget is passed as planned and that the fiscal adjustment will be pushed off to 2023 and onward, the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be 73.5 percent in 2021 and 73 percent in 2022. Since the exit from thethird lockdown, there has been an increase in the adjusted employment rate (according to which COVID-19-related absentees are not considered employed), and a decline in the broad unemployment rate. The improvement follows a reduction in support for COVID-19-related unemployed. However, since August, the improvement in the employment indices has slowed. Labor Force data for the first half of September (aged 15+) indicate stability in the broad unemployment rate at 7.9 percent (Figure 8<span dir 3DLTR><span dir 3DLTR>) and in the adjusted employment rate at 58.7 percent, while the latter was 61.1 percent in 2019, prior to the crisis (Figure 9). This represents a gap of about 168,000 employees (2.4 percentage points) compared with the average employment ratein 2019. The number of job vacancies continues to increase, further to the trend since the beginning of the year (Figure 10). This phenomenon is typical of other advanced economies that have experienced a rapid growth in unemployment due to governmental furlough policies that led to new job vacancies being created with the easing of restrictions and the rapid growth of GDP, which were filled relatively slowly. This may indicate a higher structural unemployment rate. According to the Business Tendency Survey, the shortage of workers continues to weigh on the expansion of activity, particularly in the hotels, manufacturing (professional employees), and services industries (Figure 11). The CPI reading for August was up by 0.3 percent, and inflation in the past 12 months is 2.2 percent (1.9 percent net of energy, fruits and vegetables; Figure 14). Inflation of the prices of nontradable components continues to trend upward, while the inflation rate of prices of tradable goods remained stable (Figure 15). The upward trend in one-year inflation expectations from all sources also continues, but expectations are within the target range. However, there is a marked gap between expectations derived from the capital market and thoseof the professional forecasters and the banks, which are lower (Figure 16). Medium-range expectations increased, and long-term expectations remained anchored at the midpoint of the target range (Figure 17). The Monetary Committee is closely monitoring these developments, and maintains its assessment that there is no concern of an inflationary outbreak. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel weakened by 0.5 percent against the US dollar, while it strengthenedby 1.1 percent against the euro, and by 0.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate (Figure 18). Home prices increased by about 8 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 22): a faster rate than in previous years: and the decline in building completions continues (Figure 23). In July, there was some moderation in the volume of transactions among all types of purchasers, but their level remained high. The volume of new mortgages taken out in August was similar to previous months, further to the high volume ofnew mortgages since the beginning of the year (Figure 24). Alongside this, the pace of increase in rental prices remains relatively moderate. In the capital market, equity prices increased during the reviewed period, in contrast with the global trend, and corporate bond spreads declined slightly (Figures 36 and 21). Yields on 10-year government bonds in Israel increased by about 25 basis points, similar to the global trend (Figure 19). The credit market continues to function well, with stable and low interest rates (Figures 26 and 27). The Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey examination of financing difficulties among large businesses continues to show similar levels to those prior to the crisis (Figure 25). However, it seems that the momentum has weakened due to difficulties in the global supply chain and higher energy prices that are increasing the existing inflation risks. There was no material change in the investment houses' forecasts of the expected global growth rate, but broken down into blocs, there was a decline in the forecasts for the US and Japan and an increase in the forecasts for Europe and the emerging economies (Figure 28). The global purchasing managers indices moderated, but continue to indicate economic expansion (Figure 30). The volume of world trade moderated as well, but remains at high levels of activity. The major stock indices in the US and Europe declined. The prices of oil and natural gas increased significantly during the period. The global inflation environment remains high (Figure 31), but the baseline assessment of the central banks in leading economies and of the capital markets is that a significant portion of the increase is not expected to persist (Figure 32). Inflation indices in many countriesare high, and in some of them the index has surpassed the inflation target. In the US, the Federal Reserve left the interest rate and purchasing program unchanged, but signaled a reduction of the purchasing program in the near future, and brought forward the forecast for the first increase in the interest rate to the end of 2022. In the eurozone, the ECB left the interest rate unchanged, but slowed its purchasing program. In the UK, in view of the increased inflation risk, the Bank of England signaled a future rate increase. In China, there was a slowdown in economic activity, particularly industrial production. Likewise, there were interest rate increases in a number of countries that are experiencing considerable inflationary pressures. </p> The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on October 21, 2021. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. November 22, 2021.

Peru,2021-10-07,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT OCTOBER 2021 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 1.50% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 50 bps to 1.50 percent. Monetary policy is still expansionary, with a historically low reference interest rate. The current decision does not necessarily imply a cycle of successive increases in the reference rate. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation increased from 4.95 percent in August to 5.23 percent in September, temporarily above the target range due mainly to a surge in international food and fuel prices, as well as exchange rate depreciation. Year-on- year core inflation was 2.57 percent in September. Inflation is expected to return to the target range over the next twelve months and remain within target for the rest of next year, as transitory pressures (exchange rate and international fuel and grain prices) will likely revert, with economic activity below potential. One-year-ahead expected inflation increased from 3.1 percent in August to 3.6 in September; and is forecasted at 3.25 percent for 2022, slightly above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most indicators of expectations for economic activity improved slightly in September, but remain in pessimistic territory. The current improvement in global economic activity is expected to continue into the next quarters, as the vaccination rollout continues around the world and significant stimulus packages are implemented in developed countries. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation expectations and economic activity, with an aim to consider, if necessary, changes in the monetary stance. Based on the available information, the Board sees the convenience of maintaining an expansionary stance for an extended period through a gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows. In a context of uncertainty, financial markets showed high volatility, with BCRP policies aiming at mitigating it. The Board also decided to raise the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 1.35 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 2.0 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on November 11, 2021."
India,2021-10-08,"Monetary Policy Statement, 2021-22 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) October 6-8, 2021 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (October 8, 2021) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. The reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Since the MPC's meeting during August 4-6, 2021, the momentum of the global recovery has ebbed across geographies with the rapid spread of the delta variant of COVID-19, including in some countries with relatively high vaccination rates. After sliding to a seven-month low in August, the global purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose marginally in September. World merchandise trade volumes remained resilient in Q2:2021, but more recently there has been a loss of momentum with the persistence of supply and logistics bottlenecks.2 3. Commodity prices remain elevated, and consequently, inflationary pressures have accentuated in most advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs), prompting monetary tightening by a few central banks in the former group and several in the latter. Change in monetary policy stances, in conjunction with a likely tapering of bond purchases in major advanced economies later this year, is beginning to strain the international financial markets with a sharp rise in bond yields in major AEs and EMEs after remaining range-bound in August. The US dollar has strengthened sharply, while the EME currencies have weakened since early-September with capital outflows in recent weeks. Domestic Economy 4. On the domestic front, real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 20.1 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) during Q1:2021-22 on a large favourable base; however, its momentum was dragged down by the second wave of the pandemic. The level of real GDP in Q1:2021-22 was 9.2 per cent below its pre-pandemic level two years ago. On the demand side, almost all the constituents of GDP posted robust y-o-y growth. On the supply side, real gross value added (GVA) increased by 18.8 per cent y-o-y during Q1:2021-22. The rebound in economic activity gained traction in August-September, facilitated by the ebbing of infections, easing of restrictions and a sharp pick-up in the pace of vaccination. The south-west monsoon, after a lull in August, picked up in September, narrowing the deficit in the cumulative seasonal rainfall to 0.7 per cent below the long period average and kharif sowing exceeded the previous year's level. Record kharif foodgrains production of 150.5 million tonnes as per the first advance estimates augurs well for the overall agricultural sector. By end-September, reservoir levels at 80 per cent of the full reservoir level were above the decadal average, which is expected to boost rabi production prospects. After a prolonged slowdown, industrial production posted a high y-o-y growth for the fifth consecutive month in July. The manufacturing PMI at 53.7 in September remained in positive territory. Services activity gained ground with support from the pent-up demand for contact-intensive activities. The services PMI continued in expansion zone in September at 55.2, although some sub-components moderated. High-frequency indicators for August-September  railway freight traffic; cement production; electricity demand; port cargo; e-way bills; GST and toll collections  suggest progress in the normalisation of economic activity relative to pre-pandemic levels; however, indicators such as domestic air traffic, two-wheeler sales and steel consumption continue to lag. Non-oil export growth remained strong on buoyant external demand. Headline CPI inflation at 5.3 per cent in August softened for the second consecutive month, declining by one percentage point from the recent peak in May- June 2021. This was primarily driven by an easing in food inflation. Fuel inflation edged up to a new high in August. Core inflation, i.e. inflation excluding food and fuel, remained elevated and sticky at 5.8 per cent in July-August 2021.3 8. System liquidity remained in large surplus in August-September, with daily absorptions rising from an average of â¹7.7 lakh crore in July-August to â¹9.0 lakh crore during September and â¹9.5 lakh crore during October (up to October 6) through the fixed rate reverse repo, the 14-day variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) and fine- tuning operations under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF). Auctions of â¹1.2 lakh crore under the secondary market government securities acquisition programme (G- SAP 2.0) during Q2:2021-22 provided liquidity across the term structure. As on October 1, 2021, reserve money (adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in the cash reserve ratio) expanded by 8.3 per cent (y-o-y); money supply (M3) and bank credit grew by 9.3 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively, as on September 24, 2021. India's foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 60.5 billion in 2021-22 (up to October 1) to US$ 637.5 billion, partly reflecting the allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs), and were close to 14 months of projected imports for 2021-22. Outlook 9. Going forward, the inflation trajectory is set to edge down during Q3:2021-22, drawing comfort from the recent catch-up in kharif sowing and likely record production. Along with adequate buffer stock of foodgrains, these factors should help to keep cereal prices range bound. Vegetable prices, a major source of inflation volatility, have remained contained in the year so far and are likely to remain soft, assuming no disruption due to unseasonal rains. Supply side interventions by the Government in the case of pulses and edible oils are helping to bridge the demand supply gap; the situation is expected to improve with kharif harvest arrivals. The resurgence of edible oils prices in the recent period, however, is a cause of concern. On the other hand, pressures persist from crude oil prices which remain volatile over uncertainties on the global supply and demand conditions. Domestic pump prices remain at very high levels. Rising metals and energy prices, acute shortage of key industrial components and high logistics costs are adding to input cost pressures. Weak demand conditions, however, are tempering the pass-through to output prices. The CPI headline momentum is moderating with the easing of food prices which, combined with favourable base effects, could bring about a substantial softening in inflation in the near-term. Taking into consideration all these factors. CPI inflation is projected at 5.3 per cent for 2021-22; 5.1 per cent in Q2, 4.5 per cent in Q3; 5.8 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22, with risks broadly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2022-23 is projected at 5.2 per cent (Chart 1). Domestic economic activity is gaining traction with the ebbing of the second wave. Going forward, rural demand is likely to maintain its buoyancy, given the above normal kharif sowing while rabi prospects are bright. The substantial acceleration in the pace of vaccination, the sustained lowering of new infections and the coming festival season should support a rebound in the pent-up demand for contact intensive services, strengthen the demand for non-contact intensive services, and bolster urban demand. Monetary and financial conditions remain easy and supportive of growth. Capacity utilisation is improving, while the business outlook and consumer confidence are reviving. The broad-based reforms by the government focusing on infrastructure development, asset monetisation, taxation, telecom sector and banking sector should boost investor confidence, enhance capacity expansion and facilitate crowding in of private investment. The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme augurs well for domestic manufacturing and exports. Global semiconductor4 shortages, elevated commodity prices and input costs, and potential global financial market volatility are key downside risks to domestic growth prospects, along with uncertainty around the future COVID-19 trajectory. Taking all these factors into consideration, projection for real GDP growth is retained at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22 consisting of 7.9 per cent in Q2; 6.8 per cent in Q3; and 6.1 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22. Real GDP growth for Q1:2022-23 is projected at 17.2 per cent (Chart 2). Inflation prints in July-August were lower than anticipated. With core inflation persisting at an elevated level, measures to further ameliorate supply side and cost pressures, including through calibrated cuts in indirect taxes on petrol and diesel by both Centre and States, would contribute to a more durable reduction in inflation and anchoring of inflation expectations. The outlook for aggregate demand is progressively improving but the slack is large: output is still below pre-COVID level and the recovery is uneven and critically dependent upon policy support. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, contact intensive services, which contribute around two-fifth of economic activity in India, still lag considerably. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector is below its pre-pandemic levels and an early recovery to its long-run average is critical for a sustained rebound in investment demand. Even as the domestic economy is showing signs of mending, the external environment is turning more uncertain and challenging, with headwinds from slowing growth in some major Asian and advanced economies, steep jump in natural gas prices in the recent weeks and concerns emanating from normalisation of monetary policy in some major advanced economies. Against this backdrop, the ongoing domestic recovery needs to be nurtured assiduously through all policy channels. The MPC will remain watchful given the uncertainties surrounding the outlook for growth and inflation. Accordingly, keeping in mind the evolving situation, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.5 12. All members of the MPC  Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma. Dr.Mridul K. Saggar. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das  unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent. All members, namely. Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Dr.Mridul K.

Varma, voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published on October 22, 2021. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during December 6 to 8, 2021. (Yogesh Dayal) Press Release: 2021-2022/1002 Chief General Manager."
South Korea,2021-10-12,"The bank of korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 0.75% for the intermeeting period. Currently available information suggests that the global economy has continued to recover despite the spread of COVID-19 variants, supported by accelerated vaccinations and the relaxation of restrictions on economic activity in major countries. In global financial markets, government bond yields in major countries have increased steeply and the US dollar has strengthened while stock prices have fallen, amid growing concerns over the prospect of prolonged global inflation and the rising possibility of the US Federal Reserve's tapering within the year. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by global inflation movements and monetary policy changes in major countries. The Korean economy has continued its sound recovery. Exports have sustained their buoyancy and facilities investment has continued its robust trend. Private consumption has recently shown improvement again, after having slowed due to the coronavirus resurgence. Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with a sustained year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed. Going forward, the economy is likely to continue its recovery as private consumption is forecast to improve gradually, affected by vaccinations and the consequent expansion of economic activity as well as the execution of a supplementary budget, while exports and investment are expected to sustain their buoyancy. GDP growth this year is projected to be around 4%, consistent with the forecast in August. Consumer price inflation has remained high at the mid-2% level due to the accelerating increase in the prices of petroleum products and of services. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has risen to the mid-1% level. The inflation expectations of the general public have remained at the mid-2% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will run at the mid-2% level for some time, exceeding the path projected in August, before declining somewhat. Core inflation is forecast to increase to around the upper-1% level. In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate have risen significantly while stock prices have fallen considerably, mainly driven by global financial market movements. The increase in household loans remains at a high level, and housing prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board will appropriately adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation as the Korean economy is expected to continue its sound growth and inflation to run above 2% for some time, despite ongoing uncertainties over the virus. In this process the Board will judge when to further adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to COVID-19, changes in the pace of growth and inflation, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, and monetary policy changes in major countries."
Chile,2021-10-13,"NoPtrae sdse R eplereasnes*a Wednesday, 13 October 2021 Monetary Policy Meeting  October 2021 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate (MPR) by 125 basis points, to 2.75%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of its members. On the external front, the outlook for global activity has moderated at the margin, as a result of the constraints associated with new Covid-19 outbreaks in some economies and persistent bottlenecks around the world, which has held back growth in certain industries. This has occurred in a context of further rising global inflation. In recent days, there have been notorious increases in fuel prices, with oil rising above US$80 per barrel, that is, an increase of more than 15% since the latest Meeting. Copper has continued to trade at around $4.2 per pound. In this scenario, several central banks have adopted a less expansionary stance, as the Fed and the Bank of England have made changes in their communications and Norway. New Zealand and several emerging economies have raised their policy rates. The international financial markets show a reduced appetite for risk, considering both the aforementioned elements and the fear surrounding China's real-estate sector. This has led to interest rate increases across the board, a depreciation of a significant number of currencies against the dollar, and mixed movements in the stock markets. In Chile, the financial markets have deteriorated much more strongly and systematically, standing at the extremes of international movements. This is explained by idiosyncratic factors, especially the change in the inflation outlook and uncertainty surrounding political and legislative issues, most importantly new withdrawals of pension funds. In the fixed-income market, interest rates rose in every category, especially in the medium and long tranches. The 10-year nominal interest rate exceeded 6.5%, a record high in over a decade. This, since early September to date, the difference with its U.S. counterpart went from around 370 basis points (bp) to near 500pb. Over the same period, the exchange rate continued to rise, accumulating a depreciation of more than 5% relative to the dollar, while the IPSA fell by around 8% and the country risk (CDS) increased by some 25pb. Regarding activity, the August Imacec rose 19.1% annually and 1.1% monthly in seasonally adjusted terms. Trade continues to lead as the most dynamic sector, while several lagging sectors âespecially service activitiesâ have been returning to their pre-pandemic levels. This result, together with high demand, have responded to the easing of sanitary restrictions. Investment-related items have shown a significant rebound, reflecting a recovery that has become more transversal, beyond the fact that the tradable component continues to be the most dynamic. In the labor market, employment has increased in the main categories, accompanied by a fall in the rate of inactivity and unemployment, which stood at 8.5% in the June-August quarter. Still, there remains a clear mismatch between labor supply and demand, mainly among the less skilled, which has also reflected in wage increases. In this context, private expectations for this year's growth have risen further, up to 11% in the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) of October. For the years 2022 and 2023, the economic performance expectation is reduced considerably, to around 2% each. Business confidence (IMCE) is in optimistic territory, with increased hiring in the short term, although it also shows higher costs and inventory shortages. Among consumers, meanwhile, confidence shows a slight drop (IPEC), especially affected by the increase in inflation which, according to several qualitative indicators, ranks first as the economic issue of greatest concern for Chileans. [INF*RES*AS] Nota de prensa As for bank credit, consumer and commercial loans reduced their annual contraction rates in real terms, while the flow of mortgage loans has remained fairly stable. Interest rates posted new marginal increases in every portfolio. Meanwhile, the Bank Lending Survey of the third quarter shows stronger demand in most credit segments, while supply is more stable according to measured perceptions. In September, the annual variation of the CPI rose to 5.3%, outweighing expectations, while its core part accumulated an annual increase of 4.2%, close to the forecast in the September Monetary Policy Report. The increase of recent months has affected every item in the CPI basket, reflecting inflationary pressures on both the demand and the cost side, as well as the sharp depreciation of the peso. In addition, in recent months the INE has been reinstating in its measurement the prices imputed during the pandemic. In this context, inflation expectations have risen in all horizons. In the immediate term, some measures exceed the forecasts in the September MP Report, going past 6% for the end of this year. Two years ahead, the median of the EES and of the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) has risen and remains above 3% annually. The evolution of the macroeconomic scenario has increased the risks regarding the convergence of inflation to the 3% target within the policy horizon. Although core inflation has evolved in line with projections, the outlook for the coming months has been rising, in a context where inflation expectations two years ahead stand above the 3% target. The Board has decided to anticipate the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus, projecting that the policy rate will reach its neutral level sooner than foreseen in the September Report's central scenario. The MPR trajectory will be assessed in the next Monetary Policy Report, taking consideration of the need to prevent a more persistent increase in inflation that drives it to depart from the 3% target in the two-year horizon. Additionally, the Board agreed to suspend the reserve accumulation program initiated last January, by virtue of the recent evolution of the financial market and the level of international reserves already reached. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be released at 8:30 hours of Thursday 28 October 2021. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will be held on 14 December 2021, and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours the same day. ___The Spanish original prevails.

Hungary,2021-10-19,"At its meeting on 19 October 2021, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 20 October 2021:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. Global economic recovery continued in recent months, and in parallel, inflation rose. Where the reopening took place earlier an increase in consumer prices occurred faster as well. The fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic has led to a renewed increase in risks surrounding the economic recovery. International confidence indicators in manufacturing and services weakened in September. Global investor sentiment has deteriorated since the Council's previous policy decision. Among already existing risks, the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus, the shortage of microchips, and monetary policy messages of the world's leading central banks have contributed to this. In addition, as new factors, the energy crisis and the emergence of risks related to the Chinese real estate market have also contributed to a worsening in investor sentiment. In commodity markets, another significant wave of price increases occurred in September. In the case of energy sources, the rise in prices was extraordinarily high. The price of natural gas has more than tripled since the beginning of the summer, while the price of electricity has more than doubled. World market price of crude oil rose to over USD 80. Overall, the US dollar appreciated against the euro and most emerging market currencies. The world's leading central banks have maintained loose monetary conditions in the past month, but there has been a shift in their communications towards a tighter tone. At its September policy meeting, the decision-makers of the Federal Reserve signalled that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases might soon be warranted if the economy develops in line with expectations. The European Central Bank slowed the pace of purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) in September. In the CEE region, the Romanian and Polish central banks started to raise policy rates due to an increase in the inflation outlook, and the Czech central bank raised its policy rate more than expected by market participants. The Hungarian economy restarted successfully. GDP reached its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter. Hungary is among the economies in Europe showing the fastest recovery. Based on monthly data, strong economic recovery continued in the third quarter. A wide range of sectors contributed to growth, but there were differences in the pace of recovery. The year-on-year rate of industrial and construction output growth slowed in August compared to the previous month. The recovery in the domestic automobile industry has been held back by a global shortage in microchips; however, robust growth in battery manufacturing is becoming increasingly dominant in industrial production. The volume of retail sales continued to rise in August, approaching pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate continues to be low in international comparison. Hungary's GDP is expected to grow by between 6.5 and 7 percent in 2021 and by between 5 and 6 percent in 2022. In the favourable labour market environment, growth in household consumption is expected to continue, while a general pick-up in investment is likely to make a positive contribution to GDP growth from 2021 again. The investment rate will rise to a historically high level in the second half of the forecast horizon. Hungarian export performance has rebounded strongly in 2021, and with the utilisation of new export capacities built in previous years, it is expected to grow markedly over the entire forecast horizon. The fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic and the energy crisis are increasing the risks to the economic outlook. In September 2021, annual inflation was 5.5 percent, and core inflation stood at 4.0 percent. Headline inflation rose by 0.6 percentage points and core inflation by 0.4 percentage points compared to the previous month. The rise in inflation was driven by price increases affecting a wide range products and services. The global pick-up in commodity prices is gradually appearing in consumer prices of a growing range of products. Inflation is expected to rise further in the autumn months. The significant rise in commodity prices in recent weeks points to a higher inflation path in the short run than expected in September. The pass-through of increased commodity prices and freight costs into industrial goods prices is expected to be crucial in the case of underlying inflation. Core inflation is expected to be around 4 percent throughout the remainder of the year. The effects of the Bank's tightening cycle will be clearly felt in 2022. According to the September Inflation Report's projection, inflation is expected to start to fall from the beginning of 2022 and to return to the central bank tolerance band in the second quarter, before stabilising around the 3 percent central bank target in the second half of 2022. The risks to the outlook for inflation remain on the upside. Rises in commodity and energy prices as well as international freight costs continue to point to a higher external inflationary environment which is more persistent than previously expected. Demand-supply frictions emerging temporarily, and the renewed tightening of labour market capacities in certain sectors, combined with dynamic wage growth, also carry upside risks to inflation. The government deficit is expected to fall from this year and the debt-to-GDP ratio to shift to a declining path even taking into account the September issuance of foreign currency denominated bonds. The current account balance is expected to improve over the forecast horizon, with a growing contribution from net exports due to new export capacities built up. The economy's net lending is likely to increase further and to stabilise around 3 percent of the GDP, and therefore Hungary's net external debt will continue to fall. At its meeting today, the Monetary Council decided to continue to tighten monetary conditions. In the decision-makers' assessment, the outlook for inflation and the risks surrounding it, which remained on the upside, clearly warrant the continuation of the monthly interest rate tightening cycle started in June. According to the October decision, the central bank base rate rises by 15 basis points to 1.80 percent. The Monetary Council also considers a 15-basis point increase in the interest rate corridor to be justified: the overnight deposit rate increases to 0.85 percent, while the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates increase to 2.75 percent. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at weekly tenders. According to the Monetary Council's assessment, it is warranted to increase the interest rate on the one-week deposit instrument by the same measure as in the base rate. Maintaining an active presence in the market, the MNB has managed to cushion the spillover effects of tensions in international swap markets, thereby contributing to preserving the stability of monetary conditions. It remains a key priority for the MNB that short-term rates in every sub-market and at all times should develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. To this end, the MNB continues to phase out its FX swap facility providing forint liquidity in a dynamic way, taking into account developments in the swap market. In addition, the Bank will prepare further steps to preserve the stability of the swap market and the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission in the coming months. In the Council's assessment, a stable liquidity position in the government securities market remains crucial from the perspective of monetary policy transmission. In its September decision, the Council set the target amount of the MNB's weekly purchases at HUF 40 billion. The MNB continues to use the government securities purchase programme taking a flexible approach to changing the quantity and structure of weekly purchases, to the extent and for the time necessary. If warranted by the maintenance of market stability, the MNB will stand ready to temporarily raise the volume of weekly purchases at any given time. The Bank will not sell the stock of government securities on its balance sheet, purchased government securities will be held to maturity. The Monetary Council will set the next target amount of weekly purchases for the following quarter in December. The Monetary Council is committed to achieving and maintaining price stability. In the decision-makers' assessment, the inflation outlook continues to be surrounded by upside risks which might prove to be more persistent than earlier expected. For this reason, the Council considers it necessary to continue the monthly interest rate tightening cycle. The Monetary Council will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes until the outlook for inflation stabilises around the central bank target in a sustainable manner and inflation risks become evenly balanced on the horizon of monetary policy."
Turkiye,2021-10-21,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 18 percent to 16 percent. Despite the recovery in global economic activity in the first half of the year, recently published confidence indices have started to decline due to the effect of the pandemic. Nonetheless, despite the increase in the vaccination rate, new variants keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive. Recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. Unfavorable effects of weather conditions in major agricultural commodity exporting countries are observed on global food prices. While the effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation would be mostly temporary along with normalization in demand composition, easing of supply constraints and waning base effects. Accordingly, central banks in advanced economies continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs. Leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of robust external demand. The spread of domestic vaccination throughout the society facilitates the recovery in services, tourism and related sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. While the demand for durable consumer goods slows down, a recovery is observed in non-durable consumer goods. The improvement in annualized current account is expected to continue in the rest of the year due to the strong upward trend in exports, and the strengthening of this trend is important for the price stability objective. Recent increase in inflation has been driven by supply side factors such as rise in food and import prices, especially in energy, and supply constraints, increase in administered prices and demand developments due to the reopening. It is assessed that these effects are due to transitory factors. On the other hand, the decelerating impact of the monetary tightening on credit and domestic demand is being observed. The tightness in monetary stance has started to have a higher than envisaged contractionary effect on commercial loans. In addition, strengthened macroprudential policy framework has started to curb personal loan growth. The Committee evaluated the analyses to decompose the impact of demand factors that monetary policy can have an effect, core inflation developments and supply shocks. Accordingly the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 200 basis points to 16 percent. Nevertheless, the Committee assessed that, till the end of the year, supply-side transitory factors leave limited room for the downward adjustment to the policy rate. In order to contain climate-based and other environmental risks, the Committee also decided to support sustainable finance initiatives as a long-term policy without prejudice to the main objectives of monetary policy. The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2021-10-21,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 8.5% per annum. This decision comes in line with a decline in inflation to 5% at the end of next year projected in the baseline scenario of the updated macroeconomic forecast. As expected, inflation ranged between 10% and 11% in the past several months, which was close to the forecast the NBU made in July. Consumer inflation increased to 11% in September. A number of external and internal factors continued to fuel inflation. Global commodity prices remained high. The underlying inflationary pressure also persisted as expected. An increase in businesses' production costs  namely expenses on wages, raw materials, and energy  impacted consumer prices. Inflation expectations also remained high. At the same time, benign FX market conditions restrained price growth. This maintained core inflation below the July forecast trajectory. Inflation will decline to a single-digit level at the end of 2021 and will reach the 5% target at the end of 2022. The NBU has maintained its 2021 inflation forecast at 9.6%. The NBU estimates the growth in consumer prices will peak in SeptemberOctober this year. Afterwards, the inflation trend will reverse. Inflation will decline thanks to waning low base effects. FX markets remaining favorable, and this year's large harvests. The monetary policy tightening actions taken earlier by the NBU  the optimization of the monetary policy design, a complete phaseout of anti-crisis monetary measures, and raising the key policy rate  will also curb growth in consumer prices. The above factors will make inflation slow to 5% at the end of 2022 and remain close to the target further on. A faster disinflation will be impeded by energy prices remaining high longer and by sustained consumer demand. Moreover, considering the prolonged effects of these pro-inflationary factors, the NBU will have to tighten the monetary conditions in 20222023 more than envisaged in the July forecast in order to bring inflation to the target of 5%. The NBU has revised its forecast of real GDP growth over the forecast horizon taking into account a more lasting and strong impact of the pandemic and the consequences of the surge in natural gas prices. In H1 2021, the economic recovery was somewhat weaker than expected. This was driven by a number of factors, in particular by quarantine restrictions. In contrast, high-frequency indicators of economic activity point to an economic revival in H2. A record harvest of early grain crops spurred growth in agriculture. Robust consumer demand supported retail trading and passenger turnovers. A pickup in investment activity, together with a favorable external price environment, contributed to a recovery in construction and industrial production. However, factoring in the results of H1, high energy prices, and the worsening of the pandemic, the NBU has revised downward its economic growth forecast for 2021, from 3.8% to 3.1%. Unfavorable conditions on the energy market and the impact of global logistic problems will continue to limit Ukraine's industrial output and curb economic recovery next year. Therefore, the NBU has downgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2022, from 4% to 3.8%. The economy will grow by 4% in 2023. The main drivers of economic growth over the forecast horizon will be the continued global economic recovery and an increase in domestic demand, including investment demand. The terms of trade will also remain favorable for Ukrainian exporters. The progress in vaccinations will have a positive effect as well, as it will prevent the imposition of lockdowns or other restrictions on economic activity. In particular, this will let the services sector recover and will help bring the labor force participation rate to its pre-pandemic levels. The current account deficit will be small in 2021 on the back of a bumper harvest and high export prices. However, it will widen markedly in the coming years. In 2021, the current account deficit will hit about 1% of GDP. In the coming years, the deficit will gradually widen to 3% to 4% of GDP. The deficit will be driven by some worsening in the terms of trade and more robust consumer and investment demand resulting from economic recovery. The current account deficit will be fully offset by inflows of capital  both debt and foreign direct investment inflows  in Ukraine. The main assumption made by the NBU Board is that Ukraine will continue to cooperate with the IMF. Ukraine has reached staff level agreement (SLA) with the IMF. This has opened the way for the first revision of the Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) by the IMF Executive Board, and for consideration of the request for the program to be continued. The implementation of the existing Stand-by Arrangement will ensure the receipt of official financing in 20212022, provide better terms of external borrowing, while also supporting foreign investors' interest in hryvnia assets. Cooperation with the IMF will help speed up economic growth, stabilize inflation at its target level, and maintain international reserves at USD 30 to USD 31 billion in the coming years. As set forth in the baseline scenario, with a view to bringing inflation back to its 5% target, the NBU will keep its key policy rate no lower than 8.5% at least until Q3 2022 rather than until Q2, as was expected in July. The key policy rate will be cut more gradually in 2022 than forecast before. The key policy rate is also expected to stand at 7.5% in late 2022, as opposed to 6.5%, as predicted in the previous forecast. The key risks to the economy are the imposition of stricter quarantine measures in Ukraine and globally, and a longer and more pronounced than expected surge in global inflation. Higher morbidity due to the low vaccination coverage in Ukraine could lead to a stricter lockdown and a more significant slowdown in economic activity. However, in contrast to the quarantine imposed last year, this time supply will be more affected than demand, which could increase pro-inflationary pressures. What is more, there are stronger risks of a more protracted global price surge than envisaged in the baseline scenario, which will put pressure on domestic prices. This, among things, refers to high energy prices persisting for a long time and disrupted supply chains amid strong aggregate demand. These factors could cause global stagflation. Other pro-inflationary risks also remain important, such as a sharp deterioration in terms of trade, capital outflows from emerging markets, and an escalation of the military conflict with Russia. In view of the above, the NBU assesses the balance of risks for its baseline scenario of inflation and the key policy rate as having shifted upwards, especially in the medium term. If the said or any other pro-inflationary risks materialize, the NBU stands ready to raise its key policy rate and deploy other monetary tools. It could decide to do so even during the December meeting. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 8.5% was approved by NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No. 517, dated 21 October 2021. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the central bank's Inflation Report on 28 October 2021. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 1 November 2021. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 9 December 2021, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
Russia,2021-10-22,"On 22 October 2021, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to increase the key rate by 75 b.p. to 7.50% per annum. Inflation is developing substantially above the Bank of Russia's forecast and is expected to be within the range of 7.47.9% at the end of 2021. The contribution of persistent factors to inflation remains considerable on the back of faster growth in demand relative to output expansion capacity. In this environment, given that inflation expectations are up again, the balance of risks for inflation is markedly tilted to the upside. This may bring about a more sustained deviation of inflation from the target. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy stance is aimed to limit this risk and return inflation to 4%. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate rises at its upcoming meetings. Key rate decisions will take into account actual and expected inflation movements relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Based on the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will edge down to 4.04.5% in 2022 and will remain close to 4% further on. Inflation movements. Inflation is developing above the Bank of Russia's July forecast. In September, the paces of monthly seasonally adjusted growth in consumer prices were up markedly. Annual inflation rose to 7.4% (from 6.7% in August). According to an estimate as of 18 October, it went up to 7.8%. Inflation is expected to be within the range of 7.47.9% as of the end of 2021. The acceleration in annual inflation since the second half of August comes in many ways as a result of rising fruit and vegetable prices. However, indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements appreciably exceed 4% (annualised). Bank of Russia estimates show. This largely reflects the fact that steady growth in domestic demand exceeds production expansion capacity in a wide range of sectors. In this context, businesses find it easier to pass higher costs, including on the back of rising global prices, on to consumers. At the same time, the impact of one-off supply-side drivers of inflation translates into growing prices for a wider range of goods and services as inflation expectations of households and businesses remain high and unanchored. In October, households' inflation expectations were up again to a fresh five-year high. Recent data suggest a rise in price expectations of businesses, which are invariably close to multiyear highs. Analysts' medium-term expectations are anchored close to 4%. The dominating influence of inflationary factors could lead to a more substantial and prolonged upward deviation of inflation from the target. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy stance is aimed to limit this risk and return annual inflation to 4%. Under the baseline scenario, annual inflation will edge down to 4.04.5% in 2022 and will remain close to 4% further on. Monetary conditions have not seen any significant changes since the previous meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors. Rising market rates following the increase in the key rate have so far had a limited effect on lending in the context of high inflation expectations. Yields of short-term OFZs have risen, reflecting expectations for the Bank of Russia to raise the key rate. Yields of medium- and long term OFZs are also up somewhat under the influence of trends in global financial markets. Lending and deposit rates sustain their growth driven by the key rate rises between March and September. Signs have emerged of small inflows of funds into fixed-term ruble deposits. Corporate lending is continuing to grow at rates close to recent years' highs. Disbursements of mortgage and unsecured consumer loans are still high. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy stance will help solidify a trend towards growing appeal of household deposits, protect the purchasing power of savings and ensure balanced expansion in lending. Economic activity. High-frequency indicators suggest that the economy continued to grow in Q3 albeit at a somewhat slower pace. Based on Bank of Russia estimates, this is largely associated with the return of the Russian economy to a balanced growth path. At the same time, a number of sectors are under increased pressure from supply-side constraints. Their restraining effect on business activity may strengthen against the background of tightened anti-pandemic measures. Rapid growth in lending, one-off budget payments, rising real wages and households' low propensity to save, driven by high inflation expectations, support expansion in consumer activity, especially in non-food markets. Growing domestic and external demand and high corporate profits shore up investment activity. A recovery in the services sector is held back by the challenging epidemic situation. Moderate inflationary pressure from the labour market persists. Demand for the labour force is growing in many industries. At the same time, many sectors show labour shortages, including due to remaining restrictions on the inflow of foreign labour. The unemployment rate is close to its record lows, with the number of vacancies at its record highs. The state of the labour market suggests that a further increase in steady growth rates of the Russian economy will primarily be conditional on the growth paces of labour productivity. Taking into account domestic and global economic developments as well as the nature of supply-side constraints, the Bank of Russia expects GDP to grow 4.04.5% in 2021. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, in 20222024, the Russian economy will grow 2.03.0% per annum. Inflation risks. The balance of risks is markedly tilted to the upside. The effect of inflationary factors may be intensified by elevated inflation expectations and accompanying secondary effects. Further inflationary pressure may come from remaining disruptions in production and logistics chains, staff shortages, as well as structural changes in the labour market as a result of the pandemic. An increase in structural staff shortages may cause labour productivity growth to considerably lag behind wage growth. Inflationary risks remain to be generated by price movements in global markets. Further changes in food prices will largely depend on the volume and quality of this year's crops and post-harvest quality preservation both in Russia and abroad. Short-term inflationary risks are also associated with intensified volatility in global markets caused by, among other factors, a range of geopolitical events, which may affect exchange rate and inflation expectations. Should inflation pressures in the global economy strengthen further, central banks in advanced economies may attempt an earlier normalisation of their monetary policies. This may become an additional source of higher volatility in global financial markets. Disinflationary risks for the baseline scenario remain moderate. Opening up the borders concurrently with a gradual lifting of restrictions may lead to a recovery in the consumption of foreign services and weaken supply-side constraints, including in the labour market owing to an inflow of foreign labour force. Medium-term inflation is largely influenced by fiscal policy. In its baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia proceeds from the fiscal policy normalisation path stipulated by the Guidelines for Fiscal. Tax and Customs and Tariff Policy, which assumes a return to fiscal rule parameters in 2022. The Bank of Russia's forecast also takes into account decisions made by the Russian Federation Government to invest the liquid part of the National Wealth Fund. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate rises at its upcoming meetings. Key rate decisions will take into account actual and expected inflation movements relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting of 22 October 2021 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 17 December 2021. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. Statement by Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina in follow-up to Board of Directors meeting on 22 October 2021.

Kazakhstan,2021-10-25,"Press-Release 20 The base rate raised to 9.75% October 25, 2021 Nur-Sultan The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to set the base rate at 9.75% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1.00 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities set on 10.75% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 8.75%. The decision was taken due to the continuing pro-inflationary pressure in the economy, resulted in inflation forming above the forecast range of 7.5-8.5% in 2021, rising prices in world markets, accelerating inflation in trading partner countries and high inflationary expectations within the country. The external inflationary background remains unfavorable. It is stipulated by high world food prices, disruptions in supply chains, rising costs for transportation, raw materials and energy, as well as by the recovery of domestic demand. The FAO Food Price Index in September 2021 increased by 32.8% year-on-year as a result of prices increase for all subgroups of food products. Inflation in the main trading partner countries remains at an elevated level. In China, as a result of higher prices for coal and products of energy-intensive industries, the producer price index rose to 10.7%. Annual inflation in the EU in September this year accelerated to 3.6%, in Russia  to 7.4% and continues to accelerate, as evidenced by weekly inflation in October, which amounted to 7.8% in annual terms. In Kazakhstan, in September 2021 annual inflation was 8.9%. Acceleration is observed across all the components. The main contribution to the acceleration of annual inflation continues to be made by the increase in food prices (4.5 percentage points out of 8.9%). Food inflation in September 2021 continued to accelerate, despite the seasonal decline in prices for fruit and vegetable products and amounted to 11.5% in annual terms. The main drivers of the acceleration of food inflation are the annual increase in prices for meat (10.3%), bakery (8.7%) and dairy products (8%) as a result of the increase in the producers' cost due to the increase in prices for fodder crops, diesel fuel, electricity and wheat. Additional inflationary pressure is exerted by the growth of world prices. In September 2021, the FAO index for meat increased to 26.3% in annual terms, for dairy products - 15.2%, and the increase in world prices for wheat was 41%. Non-food inflation at the end of September 2021 amounted to 7.5% in annual terms. The main contribution to this acceleration is the annual increase in prices for household items, clothing and footwear, fuel and solid fuels. Prices for clothing and footwear are rising due to higher prices for imported goods, the recovery of consumer demand and the growth of real money incomes of the population. In turn, the prices of fuels and lubricants and solid fuels increased due to the growth in costs and due to the recovery of economic activity. The inflation of paid services accelerated in September 2021 to 6.8%. The dynamics is resulted from an increase in prices for regulated services by 5.6%, education services - by 8.4% and rental housing - by 18.6%. Among regulated services, an increase in the price of electricity by 8.3% and liquefied transported gas by 6.4% was noted in September. Inflation expectations remain at an elevated level. At the same time, there is a gradual decrease from the maximum values recorded in July-August 2021. In September 2021, the quantitative assessment of inflation for the year ahead increased and amounted to 9.0%. The share of respondents expecting the accelerating and remaining current rate of inflation decreased to 59% (in August  61.5%). In the estimates of price dynamics in the past month, the share of respondents who noted a very high price increase also decreased from the maximum in July and amounted to 52% (in July  65.7%). The dynamics of the real sector development coincides with the expectations of the National Bank. According to the results of 9 months of 2021. GDP growth amounted to 3.4%, following the optimistic scenario of the National Bank. The economic recovery continued amid the rising world prices on commodity markets and the easing of quarantine restrictions. Manufacturing, trade, construction, information and communications, and the public sector demonstrate high growth rates. In addition, for the first time since March 2020, there is a positive growth rate in transport. According to the optimistic scenario, economic growth this year will be 3.7-4.0%. Consumer activity continues to recover confidently amid the improvement in the epidemiological situation. After a slight slowdown in July-August 2021, retail turnover recovered its growth rates and in September 2021 amounted to 5.6% in annual terms. In the structure of retail turnover, there was a more active dynamics of food trade with simultaneous entry into the growth zone of non-food goods turnover. The dynamic recovery of domestic demand is supported by the growth of nominal and real incomes. For 8 months, nominal income growth was 12.9%, real growth was 4.9%. High demand is reflected in the acceleration of consumer goods' imports. In 8 months of 2021, consumer imports increased by 23.9% to $7.7 billion. The current situation on the world oil market is generally assessed positively. World prices for Brent crude oil have risen to $86 per barrel for the first time since October 2018 amid a decline in global oil reserves due to increased demand, rising prices for additional energy sources (gas, coal), as well as more restrained oil supply from OPEC+ countries. Thus, from the beginning of the year to October 22, the price of Brent crude oil rose by 63%, and averaged $69.3 per barrel. According to EIA estimates, the growth rate of global oil demand will outpace its production until mid-2022, supporting the shortage of oil on the market. Starting from the second half of 2022, due to the expected increase in oil production in OPEC+ and non-OPEC countries, an excess of it may appear on the market, which may put pressure on oil prices. Thus, the optimistic scenario of the forecast round ""August-September 2021"" is being implemented, which assumes that the trajectory of oil prices is at the level of $70 per barrel on the forecast horizon. Following the developing countries, some central banks of developed countries are beginning to enter a cycle of tightening monetary conditions. Since the beginning of 2021, 31 central bank raised key rates, including developed countries as Norway and South Korea. The Central Bank of Russia is actively continuing the cycle of tightening monetary policy, raising the key rate at the last meeting by 0.75 percentage points to 7.5%. This decision is justified by a significant deviation of the actual inflation from the forecast values. By the end of 2021, inflation in Russia is expected to be in the range of 7.47.9%. The regulator also notes that inflationary processes are becoming stable due to the fact that the expansion of domestic demand significantly outstrips the possibility of increasing production. In these conditions, manufacturers transfer increased costs to prices. In turn, in this regard the inflation expectations of the population have increased, which have reached a five-year high. External institutions do not expect a rapid decline in inflation. According to IMF forecasts, developed countries are expected maximum inflation values to be reached by the end of the year, followed by a return to pre-pandemic values by mid-2022. In developing countries, inflationary pressures will continue due to higher prices for food, oil and imported goods as a result of the exchange rates weakening. Ahead of the upcoming meeting, the US Federal Reserve notes that high pressure on prices would continue as the economy opens. According to the regulator, inflation will remain at an elevated level for longer than previously expected, before it starts to decline. In this regard, the inflation forecasts for 2021 have been adjusted upwards. Under increased external and internal inflationary background, the National Bank continues to normalize monetary policy in order to enter the 4-6% corridor in 2022. The achievement of this goal also depends on the effective implementation by the Government and local executive bodies of an Anti-Inflationary Response Package. The National Bank will continue to pursue a deflationary monetary policy, including on the basis of an analysis of the taken anti-inflationary measures effectiveness. The next planned decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on December 6, 2021 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time.

Georgia,2021-10-26,"26.10.2021 THE NATIONAL BANK OF GEORGIA KEEPS ITS MONETARY POLICY RATE UNCHANGED AT 11.0 PERCENT On October 26, 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) decided to keep the monetary policy rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged. The monetary policy rate stands at 11.0 percent. Inflationary pressure is still high in most of the world, to which the leading central banks are responding with tightened financial conditions. This worsens global economic growth outlook and creates stagflation risks. Inflation in Georgia has retreated from its peak, however it still remains at a high level, amounting to 11.5 percent in September. Recently, positive trends are being observed on the international commodity markets, with commodity prices and international shipping costs declining. At the same time, although remaining at a high level, the international food price index according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been falling for 6 consecutive months. It is expected that in line with the appreciated exchange rate, these trends will gradually be transmitted to the local market, reducing inflation. However, given the current geopolitical circumstances, uncertainty still remains high. Inflation has long been deviating from its target level, with this deviation further amplifying risks around declining trend of inflation. Economic activity is still strong. The Russia-Ukraine war and the accompanying sanctions imposed on Russia have significantly increased migration flows into Georgia, boosting demand. The average real GDP growth in the first eight months of 2022 stood at 10.3 percent. Accordingly, the forecast for the economic growth in 2022 has been revised upward to 10 percent. The average annual level of economic activity in 2022 is expected to exceed its potential level. As a result, demand-driven inflationary risks have increased, although this is partly offset by the strengthening of the GEL exchange rate as a result of foreign exchange inflows. As a result of tight monetary policy and the recently implemented macroprudential instruments, the credit growth has begun to slow down. It is expected that this effect will be strengthened in the future. Along with remuneration on reserve requirements on funds borrowed in the US dollar and Euro fixed at 0 percent, monetary policy tightening from the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve will have an additional policy tightening impact of foreign currency loans in Georgia. Fiscal deficit is also shrinking. The combination of these factors will help to neutralize demand-side inflationary pressure, which will help inflation decline. Other things equal, inflation will remain high until the end of the year, but will continue to gradually decline and will approach the target level in the second half of 2023. Taking into account the existing inflationary risks, tight monetary policy will be maintained and its normalization will gradually begin only after a clear trend of decreasing inflation will be observed. On the other hand, if inflation expectations rise and/or additional demand-side price pressures emerge, further tightening of policy or maintaining the current tight stance for a longer time period might be necessary. If needed, the National Bank of Georgia will also use additional instruments to avoid inflationary pressure arising from the demand side. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on December 21, 2022."
Brazil,2021-10-27,"In its 242nd meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate to 7.75% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, a possible reversion, even if partial, of the recent increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency would produce a lower-than-projected inflation in the baseline scenario. On the other hand, further extensions of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that increase aggregate demand and deteriorate the fiscal path may pressure the country's risk premium. In spite of the more positive public accounts data, the Committee assesses that recent questioning regarding the fiscal framework increased the risk of deanchoring inflation expectations, raising the upward asymmetry in the balance of risks. This implies a higher probability of inflation paths above the one projected under the baseline scenario. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 1.50 p.p. to 7.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2022 and 2023. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment. The Committee considers that, given the deterioration of the balance of risks and the increase in its inflation projections, this pace is the most appropriate to guarantee inflation convergence to the targets at the relevant horizon. At this moment, the Copom's baseline scenario and balance of risks indicate as appropriate to advance the process of monetary tightening even further into the restrictive territory. For the next meeting, the Committee foresees another adjustment of the same magnitude. The Copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the achievement of the inflation target and will depend on the evolution of economic activity, on the balance of risks, and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary policy. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Georgia,2021-10-27,"27.10.2021 The National Bank of Georgia keeps its monetary policy rate unchanged at 10.0 percent. On October 27, 2021, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged. The monetary policy rate is 10.0 percent. The world economy has faced many challenges due to the pandemic. One of the important factors in this regard is the accelerated pace of price increases, which remains a recent concern in both developed and developing countries. Increased inflation is also a challenge for Georgia. Annual inflation stood at 12.3 percent in September. High inflation is mainly due to one-off factors, which became evident globally in 2020-2021. According to preliminary estimates, the contribution of these exogenous factors to headline inflation is about 8 percentage points. In this regard, a significant increases in USD prices of food items and a rise in oil prices, that accelerated even further recently, on the international markets are particularly noteworthy. The rapid growth of international transportation costs is also adding up to the pressure. As for aggregate demand, according to the updated forecast, real GDP growth of 10 percent is expected in 2021, which is mainly due to still sizeable fiscal stimulus, pent-up demand and a high growth rate of lending. In the increased crediting the higher contribution of foreign currency loans is particularly noteworthy, against the backdrop of increased funding costs of lari. Strong credit activity is a boost to current economic activity, however, at the same time, it hinders the reduction of inflation. Inflation will remain high for the rest of the year. In December 2021 and January-February 2022, the base effect of the utility fee subsidy program will have an additional upward impact on the annual inflation. According to the current forecast, other things equal, inflation will decline starting from spring 2022. Along with the fading-out of temporary factors, this will be facilitated by tight monetary policy and fiscal consolidation. Given that the contribution of temporary factors to inflation will continue to be a driving force and, at the same time, monetary policy stance is tight, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate at the current level. Nevertheless, in the face of strong supply shocks, the threat of inflation expectations accelerating is still relevant. In addition, inflationary risks persist and the materialization may warrant further tightening of monetary policy. A gradual re-opening of the economy had a positive effect on Georgia's foreign trade turnover as well. According to the preliminary data, exports of goods in January-September increased by 24 percent annualy and is about 9 percent higher compared to the same period in 2019. Revenues from international travelers increased by 73 percent year-on-year in the first nine months, though the decline is 66 percent compared to the same period in 2019. Imports also increased, against the backdrop of higher domestic demand, and in January-September it grew by 22 percent, whereas compared to 2019 the growth is about 3 percent. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the MPC will be held on December 8, 2021."
Euroarea,2021-10-28,"Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. The euro area economy continues to recover strongly, although momentum has moderated to some extent. Consumers continue to be confident and their spending remains strong. But shortages of materials, equipment and labour are holding back production in some sectors. Inflation is rising, primarily because of the surge in energy prices but also as the recovery in demand is outpacing constrained supply. We foresee inflation rising further in the near term, but then declining in the course of next year. Market interest rates have increased since our last meeting in early September. However, overall financing conditions currently remain favourable for firms, households and the public sector. Favourable financing conditions are essential for the economy to continue its recovery and to counter the negative impact of the pandemic on the inflation path. We continue to judge that favourable financing conditions can be maintained with a moderately lower pace of net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) than in the second and third quarters of this year. We also confirmed our other measures, namely the level of the key ECB interest rates, our forward guidance on their likely future evolution, our purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), our reinvestment policies and our longer-term refinancing operations, as detailed in the press release published at 13:45 today. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilises at our two per cent target over the medium term. I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then talk about our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. The economy continued to grow strongly in the third quarter, even though momentum moderated to some extent. We still expect output to exceed its pre-pandemic level by the end of the year. The grip of the pandemic on the economy has visibly weakened, with restrictions being lifted as a result of successful health measures and large numbers of people now vaccinated. This is supporting consumer spending, especially on entertainment, dining, travel and transportation. But higher energy prices may reduce purchasing power in the months to come. The recovery in domestic and global demand is also supporting production and business investment. That said, shortages of materials, equipment and labour are holding back the manufacturing sector. Delivery times have lengthened considerably, and transport costs and energy prices have surged. These constraints are clouding the outlook for the coming quarters. Unemployment has fallen and the number of people in job retention schemes is down significantly from the peak last year. This supports the prospect of higher incomes and increased spending. But, both the number of people in the labour force and the hours worked in the economy remain below their pre-pandemic levels. To sustain the recovery, targeted and coordinated fiscal support should continue to complement monetary policy. This support will also help the economy adjust to the structural changes that are under way. An effective implementation of the Next Generation EU programme and the âFit for 55â package will contribute to a stronger, greener and more even recovery across euro area countries. But while the current phase of higher inflation will last longer than originally expected, we expect inflation to decline in the course of next year. The upswing in inflation largely reflects a combination of three factors. First, energy prices  especially for oil, gas and electricity  have risen sharply. In September, energy inflation accounted for about half of overall inflation. Second, prices are also going up because recovering demand related to the reopening of the economy is outpacing supply. These dynamics are especially visible in the prices of consumer services, as well as the prices of goods affected most strongly by supply shortages. And finally, base effects related to the end of the VAT cut in Germany are still contributing to higher inflation. We expect the influence of all three factors to ease in the course of 2022 or to fall out of the year-on-year inflation calculation. As the recovery continues, the gradual return of the economy to full capacity will underpin a rise in wages over time. Market and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have moved closer to two per cent. These factors will support underlying inflation and the return of inflation to our target over the medium term. The recovery continues to depend on the course of the pandemic and further progress with vaccinations. In the near term, supply bottlenecks and rising energy prices are the main risks to the pace of recovery and the outlook for inflation. If supply shortages and higher energy prices last longer, these could slow down the recovery. At the same time, if persistent bottlenecks feed through into higher than anticipated wage rises or the economy returns more quickly to full capacity, price pressures could become stronger. However, economic activity could outperform our expectations if consumers become more confident and save less than currently expected. Growth and medium-term inflation dynamics still depend on favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy. Nevertheless, financing conditions for the economy remain favourable, not least because bank lending rates for firms and households remain at historically low levels. While there was a pick-up in September, lending to firms remains moderate. This continues to reflect the fact that firms generally need less external funding, since these have high cash holdings and are increasingly retaining their earnings. Lending to households remains strong, driven by demand for mortgages. Our most recent bank lending survey shows that credit conditions for firms stabilised and were supported  for the first time since 2018  by a reduction in banks' risk perceptions. By contrast, banks are taking a slightly more cautious approach to housing loans and have tightened their lending standards for these loans accordingly. Bank balance sheets continue to be supported by favourable funding conditions and remain solid. Summing up, the euro area economy continues to recover strongly, although at a more moderate pace. Rising energy prices, the recovery in demand and supply bottlenecks are currently pushing up inflation. While inflation will take longer to decline than previously expected, we expect these factors to ease in the course of next year. We continue to foresee inflation in the medium term remaining below our two per cent target. Our policy measures, including our revised forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, are crucial to helping the economy shift to a sustained recovery and, ultimately, to bringing inflation over the medium term to our target."
Egypt,2021-10-28,"Press Release October 28th, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 825 percent, 925 percent, and 875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 875 percen. Annual headline urban inflation increased to 66 percent in September 2021 from 57 percent in August 202. In addition, annual core inflation increased to record 48 percent in September 2021 from 45 percent in August 202. Annual headline inflation rates were affected by unfavorable base effects during September 2021 as expected as well as strong monthly dynamics mainly related to higher tomato price. Accordingly the acceleration in September 2021 was mainly driven by higher annual contribution of food item. Annual food inflation increased for the fifth consecutive month to 106 percent in September 2021 from 66 percent in August 202. Meanwhile partially offsetting this acceleration, is the decline in annual nonfood inflation to 49 percent in September 2021 from 53 percent in August 2021, which is the lowest recorded level since December 201. GDP growth recorded 77 percent in 2021 Q2 compared to 29 percent during the preceding quarte. Economic growth in 2021 Q2 was driven by the strong positive contributions of gross domestic investments as well as that of consumptio. On a sectoral level, tourism, non- petroleum manufacturing and natural gas extractions contributed most towards growth in economic activity with private sector activity remaining the main contributor towards overall GDP growt. Meanwhile the unemployment rate registered 73 percent in 2021 Q2 compared to 74 percent during the preceding quarte. Along the near outlook horizon, economic activity is expected to record robust growth figures, driven by domestic demand, which will also be impacted by favorable base-effect. Global economic activity continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, but has shown some signs of slowdown due to global supply chain disruption. Additionally prospects of global economic recovery remain contingent on the efficacy of vaccines and the ability of countries to contain the spread of the virus, in light of the emergence of newer variant. Global financial conditions are expected to remain accommodative and supportive of economic activity over the medium-ter. International prices for oil have continued to increase driven by both supply and demand factor. In the meantime, international prices for commodities such as food and select minerals have continued to increase but at a slower rat. Against this background, the MPC decided that keeping policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 7 percent (Â±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandat.

Colombia,2021-10-29,"Press Release (Only in Spanish). The board voted 5-2 to raise the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 2.5%; the two dissenting board members voted for a 25-basis point increase. This decision was based on the following considerations. Economic activity continued to recover at a greater pace than previously expected, a reflection of strengthening domestic demand that has benefited largely from monetary, fiscal, and regulatory policies implemented since the start of the pandemic. As a result. GDP growth projections have been revised upward to 9.8% for 2021 and 4.7% for 2022. Annual inflation at the end of September was above expectations at 4.51%, in large part due to the price behavior of foods and regulated items. Banco de la Republica's technical staff has revised its year-end inflation projections upward to 4.9% for 2021 and 3.6% for 2022. Recent labor market trends have been positive, as significant increases in employment levels have allowed for a continued decline in national and urban unemployment rates. While these figures remain above historical averages, the recovery in economic activity suggests that favorable labor market trends should continue in the coming months. The current account deficit is expected to expand to 5.3% of GDP in 2021, reflecting significant growth in domestic demand. This deterioration in the balance of payments comes amid a tightening of international conditions.. Fecha de publicacion."
Malaysia,2021-11-03,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 1.75 percent. The global economy remains on a recovery path, driven by expansion in manufacturing and services activity. Amid continued strength in global demand, supply chain disruptions, higher commodity prices and labour shortages, inflation has also risen. Nevertheless, global growth prospects will be supported by further progress in vaccination coverage and relaxation of containment measures. In several major economies, sizeable fiscal and monetary policies will continue to support the recovery momentum. Overall, the balance of risks to the global growth outlook remains tilted to the downside. This is attributed mainly to uncertainty surrounding the emergence of variants of concern, the risk of more prolonged global supply chain disruptions, and potential risk of heightened financial market volatility amid adjustments in monetary policy in major economies. For Malaysia, economic activity weakened in the third quarter, amid the imposition of nation-wide containment measures to curb the resurgence in COVID-19 cases. However, in line with the relaxation of restrictions, latest high frequency indicators show that economic activity has recovered from the trough in July. Going into 2022, the growth momentum is expected to improve, supported by expansion in global demand, higher private sector expenditure in line with the resumption of economic activity and continued policy support. Risks to the growth outlook, however, remain tilted to the downside due to external and domestic factors. These include a weaker-than-expected global growth, a worsening in supply chain disruptions, and the re-imposition of containment measures due to the impact of new COVID-19 variants of concern. In line with earlier assessments, headline inflation is likely to average within the projected range of between 2.0% and 3.0% for 2021, having averaged 2.3% year-to-date. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to average below 1.0% for the year. Moving into 2022, headline inflation is projected to remain moderate. As economic activity normalises, core inflation is expected to edge upwards but remain benign given the continued spare capacity in the economy and slack in the labour market. The outlook, however, continues to be subject to global commodity price developments and some risk from prolonged supply-related disruptions. The MPC considers the stance of monetary policy to be appropriate and accommodative. In addition, fiscal and financial measures will continue to cushion the economic impact on businesses and households and provide support to economic activity. Given the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the stance of monetary policy will continue to be determined by new data and information and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth. The Bank remains committed to utilise its policy levers as appropriate to foster enabling conditions for a sustainable economic recovery. The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2022. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times during the year. The meetings will be held over two days, with the Monetary Policy Statement released at 3 p.m. on the second day of the MPC meeting. Schedule of Monetary Policy Committee Meetings for 2022. 19 and 20 January 2022 (Wednesday and Thursday). 2 and 3 March 2022 (Wednesday and Thursday). 10 and 11 May 2022 (Tuesday and Wednesday). 5 and 6 July 2022 (Tuesday and Wednesday). 7 and 8 September 2022 (Wednesday and Thursday). 2 and 3 November 2022 (Wednesday and Thursday).

Poland,2021-11-03,"Warsaw, 3 November 2021 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 3 November 2021 The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.75 percentage points, i.e. to 1.25%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: âª lombard rate at 1.75%; âª deposit rate at 0.75%; âª rediscount rate at 1.30%; âª discount rate at 1.35%. The activity in global economy continues to recover, yet a difficult pandemic situation persisting in many countries together with supply-side constraints in some markets and a strong increase in commodity prices, have a negative impact on economic situation in some countries. Still, latest forecasts indicate a further increase in global GDP next year. At the same time a markedly higher than a year ago commodity prices  in particular prices of natural gas, but also of oil and coal, as well as of some agricultural commodities  together with continued global supply chain disruptions and significant increase in international shipping costs, contribute to a marked rise in inflation in many economies and an upward shift in its forecasts for the next year. In many economies, including in the USA and euro area, inflation significantly exceeds the central banks targets, staying at the highest levels in many years. Major central banks are keeping interest rates low while continuing asset purchases, although some of them signal the reduction in the monetary accommodation scale. At the same time central banks in the Central-Eastern Europe region have been increasing interest rates. In Poland, economic activity continues to recover. The situation in the labour market is still improving, as indicated by decreasing unemployment and a marked increase in average wage in the enterprise sector. In the coming quarters, economic conditions are expected to remain favourable. However there are significant risk factors related to the impact of autumn wave of the epidemic on the economy, as well as to the effects of supply- side constraints and high energy commodity prices on the global economic conditions. 1/2 Inflation in Poland, according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate for October 2021, increased to 6.8% in annual terms, and in monthly terms it amounted to 1.0%. The elevated inflation resulted, to a great extent, from external factors beyond the control of domestic monetary policy, such as higher than a year ago global prices of energy and agricultural commodities, earlier increase in electricity prices and in waste disposal charges, as well as disruptions in global supply chains and international transport. The ongoing economic recovery, including demand driven by rising household income, has also added to the price growth. The Council became acquainted with the results of the November projection of inflation and GDP based on the NECMOD model. In line with the projection prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 21 October 2021 there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of 4.84.9% in 2021 (against 3.84.4% in the July 2021 projection), 5.1-6.5% in 2022 (compared to 2.5-4.1%) and 2.74.6% in 2023 (compared to 2.44.3%). At the same time, the annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 4.95.8% in 2021 (against 4.15.8% in the July 2021 projection), 3.8-5.9% in 2022 (compared to 4.2-6.5%) and 3.86.1% in 2023 (compared to 4.16.5%). The rise in global prices of both energy and agricultural commodities observed this year as well as continued global supply chain disruptions have led to an increase of inflation forecasts for the coming quarters both globally and in Poland. Amidst expected further economic recovery and favourable labour market conditions, it would generate a risk of inflation remaining elevated in the monetary policy transmission horizon. In order to reduce this risk, i.e. striving to decrease inflation to the NBP target in the medium term, the Council decided to increase NBP interest rates. NBP may still intervene in the foreign exchange market and use other instruments envisaged in the Monetary Policy Guidelines. The timing and scale of the measures taken by NBP will depend on the market conditions. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  November 2021 as well as the Opinion on the 2022 Draft Budget Act."
United States,2021-11-03,"EDT November 3, 2021 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the summer's rise in COVID-19 cases has slowed their recovery. Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks to the economic outlook remain. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to - maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT November 3, 2021at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee's goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. Beginning later this month, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $70 billion per month and of agency mortgage backed securities by at least $35 billion per month. Beginning in December, the Committee - will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $60 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $30 billion per month. The Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, but it is prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook. The Federal Reserve's ongoing purchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
Czech Republic,2021-11-04,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank increased the two-week repo rate by 125 basis points to 2.75%. At the same time, it increased the discount rate to 1.75% and the Lombard rate to 3.75%. Five members voted in favour of this decision and two members voted for leaving rates unchanged.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. Consistent with the forecast is a sharp rise in market interest rates at the end of this year and the start of 2022. This is in response to the current exceptionally strong price pressures in the domestic and foreign economies. The rise in rates will limit the pass-through of these pressures into prices in the longer term, ensuring the return of inflation towards the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon. The Czech National Bank's response will also help anchor inflation expectations at its target. The global economy continues to face the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. Economic growth in the Czech Republic's main trading partner countries, which was buoyant during the summer, will slow in the rest of this year. This will be due mainly to persisting overloading of global production and supply chains and related problems with supplies of materials and components. Strong demand in the euro area is coming up against these constraints. This is greatly increasing the price pressures, especially in industry. Those pressures are being exacerbated by rising prices of oil and other energy commodities. Together with high growth in producer prices, this is being reflected in accelerating consumer price inflation. At its recent meeting, the European Central Bank announced it would reduce asset purchases under its pandemic programme as from 2021 Q4. Nevertheless, the outlook for foreign interest rates remains negative over the entire horizon. The overloading of global production chains can be expected to abate around mid-2022. This will be reflected in rising economic growth and falling price pressures. Compared with the previous forecast, the Brent crude oil price outlook has shifted distinctly higher due to reduced oil production and strong growth in demand for oil. The increase in oil prices is expected to peak at the start of next year. The euro-dollar exchange rate is little changed from the previous forecast and is expected to appreciate only slightly. In the summer months, the Czech economy continued on the path of recovery that started in the spring, as the favourable pandemic situation allowed trade and services to operate almost without constraints. According to the assumptions of the forecast, the currently observed partial tightening of anti-epidemic measures will have no tangible economic impacts. Renewed economic growth will continue to be fostered by increasing household consumption, benefiting among other things from spending of forced savings and swift wage growth on the labour market, which is overheating again. Solid external demand and labour shortages will boost firms' investment activity. Government investment will also rise. However, the performance of the Czech economy will be slowed until mid-2022 by a negative contribution of net exports. The latter will be hit by continued overloading of global production and supply chains, on which the export- and industry-oriented Czech economy is strongly dependent. GDP will grow by around 2% overall this year and gain pace considerably over the next two years. Domestic economic activity will return to the pre-pandemic level at the end of 2022. Headline inflation will rise significantly further at the close of this year and approach 7% during the winter, with all its components contributing to the increase. The faster price growth will be driven by a further increase in core inflation, reflecting significant domestic price pressures and strong producer price inflation at home and abroad. This will be accompanied by rising food prices on the back of growth in agricultural commodity prices on world markets. Fuel price inflation will also remain high. Administered prices will rise significantly at the start of 2022 owing to growth in prices of electricity and natural gas for households. The strengthening domestic inflation pressures will reflect faster wage growth in the next few quarters. However, the overall inflation pressures will start to ease in the course of next year, especially as growth in import prices fades. This will be supported by an appreciating koruna. Inflation will gradually fall in the course of next year, aided by a prior significant increase in interest rates, and will decline close to the Czech National Bank's 2% target over the monetary policy horizon. The koruna will strengthen to CZK 25 to the euro on average in Q4. This will mainly reflect a rapidly widening positive interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area. The koruna will continue to firm gradually next year due to renewed export growth, which will reflect the fade-out of the previous problems in domestic industry and the completion and export of previously unfinished products. A gradual tightening of the European Central Bank's monetary policy will have a modest opposite effect. In 2023, the koruna will be close to CZK 24 to the euro. Consistent with the autumn forecast is a sharp rise in market interest rates at the end of this year and the start of 2022. Monetary policy reacts to the exceptionally strong price pressures from the domestic economy and abroad. The continued forceful increase in rates limits the pass-through of these pressures to prices in the longer term, reinforcing the confidence of Czech economic agents in long-term price stability in our country. By comparison with the previous forecast, the inflation outlook is markedly higher for this year and especially next year. By contrast, economic growth has been revised downwards for this year and the next, and relatively significantly upwards for 2023. The outlook for domestic interest rates is higher for all three years, while the koruna exchange rate is firmer in 2022 and 2023. The Bank Board assessed the uncertainties and risks to the new forecast as being significant but not calling into question the message of the forecast overall. The duration of the global production and supply chains disruptions is the main inflationary risk to the forecast. Lengthier disruptions could generate additional price pressures in the global and domestic economies, with a weaker koruna also having an inflationary effect. The exchange rate may in itself be an additional upside risk to inflation given its recent developments. Increased inflation expectations could pose a risk in the same direction. A sharper-than-expected increase in energy prices and imputed rent is also an upside risk to inflation. By contrast, a more substantial consolidation of public budgets by the new government is a slight anti-inflationary risk."
Romania,2021-11-09,"The Board of the National Bank of Romania, having convened for the meeting of 9 November 2021, decided:. The annual inflation rate continued to rise above the upper bound of the variation band of the target in September 2021, climbing to 6.29 percent, i.e. significantly above the forecast, from 5.25 percent in August and 3.94 percent in June 2021. Its faster increase during Q3 was triggered especially by exogenous CPI components, much the same as in the first part of the year. This time round, the main contributor was the significant hike in natural gas and electricity prices in July, alongside influences from the further rise in fuel prices and the notable pick-up in vegetable prices in September. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate followed a higher upward path in Q3 to reach 3.6 percent in September from 2.9 percent in June. The evolution illustrates the effects of the rising prices of agri-food items and higher energy and transport costs, as well as the influences stemming from the persistent bottlenecks in production and supply chains, fuelled domestically by the stronger demand for goods and services after the easing of mobility restrictions and the upward movement of short-term inflation expectations, coupled with the impact of costlier compulsory motor third-party liability insurance policies in September. Average annual CPI inflation rate and average annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices climbed to 3.6 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, in September, from 2.9 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively, in June 2021. The new statistical data indicate that the economy grew by 1.9 percent in 2021 Q2  a relatively slower quarterly pace versus Q1, but somewhat brisker than previously anticipated , showing also a stronger increase in its annual dynamics to 13.9 percent, from -0.2 percent in Q1, amid the base effect associated with the sharp economic contraction in the same year-earlier period. This implies that GDP exceeded more obviously its pre-pandemic level during this period, as well as that excess aggregate demand stood slightly higher than expected. All major aggregate demand components contributed to the pick-up in annual GDP dynamics, albeit to considerably different and slightly modified extents compared to previous estimates. Thus, private consumption made almost the prevailing contribution, followed closely by the change in inventories, whereas gross fixed capital formation and general government consumption had modest contributions. Furthermore, the negative contribution of net exports to annual GDP dynamics decreased in Q2, albeit to a somewhat lower extent than previously anticipated, given that the particularly sharp increase in the annual change in exports of goods and services outpaced that in imports thereof. The trade deficit recorded, however, a faster widening in annual terms, while the annual dynamics of the current account deficit slowed down considerably versus Q1, under the impact of a relative improvement in income balances, remaining nevertheless above the average values recorded in 2019 and 2020. The latest developments and analyses indicate a more pronounced slowing of GDP growth, excluding agriculture, in the second half of 2021 compared to prior forecasts, which makes it likely for excess aggregate demand to narrow during this period, contrary to the slight increase anticipated in August. The economy as a whole is expected however to see a renewed acceleration in growth in Q3, due to the very good performance of agriculture, while its annual dynamics are anticipated to see a relatively more moderate deceleration, remaining particularly high from a historical perspective. It is worth mentioning that the annual dynamics of retail trade, the motor vehicles and motorcycles segment and market services to households stayed at an elevated level in July-August, yet considerably lower than in Q2. The annual growth rate of industrial output and that of new orders in manufacturing declined, however, considerably from the very high values recorded in Q2, while the construction activity contracted in annual terms. At the same time, turning to exports of goods and services, their annual change declined significantly in July-August, much more swiftly than that of imports, which triggered a fast acceleration in the annual increase in trade deficit. The current account deficit witnessed, however, a considerable deceleration in its annual growth rate during this period owing to income balances, but, in the first eight months of 2021 as a whole, it continued to exceed by more than 55 percent the level seen in the same period of the previous year. Labour market developments remained relatively favourable in the first two months of Q3, yet amid rising supply issues and higher energy prices, as well as increased uncertainties about the epidemiological situation. All these affected hiring in different economic sectors, as well as the ILO unemployment rate, which saw a halt in its downward trend during this period, increasing slightly against June, while returning to 5.0 percent in September. Looking at the financial market, key interbank money market rates saw a faster pick-up in October, hitting 17-month highs, prompted by the policy rate hike, as well as amid the tightening of liquidity conditions and the expectations on a further increase in the reference rate. In turn, yields on government securities followed a considerably steeper upward path across the entire maturity spectrum, inter alia in the context of the persistence of domestic political tensions and the uptrend in long-term government bond yields in developed economies and regionally. Against this background, the EUR/RON exchange rate quasi-stabilised at the high readings reached in mid-September, reflecting also the influences from the abatement of volatility on the international financial market. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector climbed further in the two-digit range in September, reaching 13.4 percent from 12.8 percent in August, due to the intense lending in local currency, supported, inter alia, by government programmes. Hence, in September, the leu-denominated component saw its pace of increase accelerate to 18.4 percent  the highest reading since May 2016  from 17.5 percent in August, its share in total private sector credit widening to 71.6 percent. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the November 2021 Inflation Report, which incorporates the latest available data and information. The updated forecast shows a significant additional worsening of the inflation outlook almost throughout the projection horizon, under the strong impact of supply-side shocks, as the forecasted path of the annual inflation dynamics has been again revised considerably upwards, especially over the short term. Specifically, the annual inflation rate is expected to remain on a steep uptrend until towards mid-2022, hence to climb further above the variation band of the target and above the previously forecasted levels, mainly as a result of the sizeable hikes anticipated for energy prices in 2021 Q4 and 2022 Q1, amid the abrupt rise in international prices. Afterwards, it will witness, however, a relatively swift downward adjustment, returning in 2023 Q3 inside the variation band of the target, in the context of ample base effects, as well as of the probably much slower increase in the excess aggregate demand, on a markedly lower trajectory than that projected in August. The measures designed to compensate and cap price increases for electricity and natural gas for households, presumed to be applied temporarily during this winter, entail fluctuations in the forecasted path of the annual inflation rate over the short time horizon  pick-up in October 2021, followed by a decline in November and then by another rise in April 2022, once prices return to the levels stipulated in the contracts. The way in which their impact will be included in the CPI calculation is still uncertain. Moreover, uncertainties and risks continue to stem from developments in commodity prices, particularly of energy and agri-food, as well as from bottlenecks in production and supply chains, likely to accelerate global inflation. Major sources of uncertainties and risks are further associated with the fiscal policy stance and the absorption of European funds, especially those under the Next Generation EU programme, also in the context of the political crisis, given inter alia: the unknowns about this year's second budget revision and the coordinates of the 2022 draft budget that would certify the prospective step-up in fiscal consolidation, in line with the commitments under the excessive deficit procedure; the legal and technical procedures due for completion for the disbursement of a pre-financing under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, alongside the milestones and targets to be reached for further disbursements. The fourth pandemic wave and the related containment measures also continue to generate high uncertainties and risks to the forecasts, at least in the near run, amid the serious public health crisis on the domestic front and the potential implications for economic activity and labour market, but also owing to the spread of the fourth wave in other European countries, badly hit by the energy crisis and by the persistence of bottlenecks in production and supply chains as well. In the meeting held today, 9 November 2021, based on the assessments and data currently available, and in light of the elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 1.75 percent per annum, from 1.50 percent per annum, as of 10 November 2021 and to maintain firm control over money market liquidity. Moreover, the NBR Board decided to extend the symmetric corridor of interest rates on standing facilities around the policy rate to Â±0.75 percentage points from Â±0.50 percentage points, implying that the lending (Lombard) facility rate will be raised to 2.50 percent per annum from 2 percent per annum, while the deposit facility rate will be kept at 1.00 percent per annum. These decisions are circumscribed to the process of gradual normalisation of the monetary policy conduct that the NBR is carrying out, amid high uncertainties, the same as other central banks in the region. At the same time, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to bring back and maintain the annual inflation rate in line with the 2.5 percent Â±1 percentage point flat inflation target, inter alia via the anchoring of inflation expectations over the longer time horizon, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth in the context of the fiscal consolidation process, while safeguarding financial stability. The NBR closely monitors developments in the domestic and international environment and stands ready to use the tools at its disposal to achieve the fundamental objective of price stability in the medium term. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be released on 11 November 2021 at 10:00 a.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 19 November 2021 at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 10 January 2022."
Thailand,2021-11-10,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 7/2021 Mr. Piti Disyatat. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 10 November 2021 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent. The Committee assessed that the Thai economy had bottomed out in the third quarter of 2021 and entered the recovery phase following the relaxation of containment measures and the re-opening of the country. Meanwhile downside risks to the economic projection decreased on account of the accelerated vaccination progress. However the fragile recovery would remain subject to uncertainties. Headline inflation increased temporarily mainly due to the global energy prices. The Committee viewed that the continued accommodative monetary policy would help support overall economic growth, and thus voted to maintain the policy rate. In addition, the ongoing financial and fiscal measures, with the focus on rebuilding and enhancing potential growth would play an important part in bolstering the robust recovery of income. The Thai economy would expand at a pace close to the previous projection for 2021 and 2022 on the back of domestic spending that gradually recovered following the relaxation of containment measures, partially offsetting the adverse impact of higher global energy prices. Looking ahead, fiscal support would decline following the substantial stimulus earlier. Merchandise exports would decelerate in tandem with growth in trading partner economies, while foreign tourist figures were expected to recover slowly. Meanwhile the labor market improved from higher income of workers in the services sector and the self-employed in line with economic activities. Headline inflation would increase temporarily owing to supply-side factors, particularly the energy prices which would likely decline by early next year. Nevertheless headline inflation would remain within the target, with upside risks including the elevated global energy prices persisting longer than expected and global supply constraints becoming more prolonged. However the slow recovery of income and purchasing power would lead to subdued demand-side inflationary pressures. Meanwhile medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target. The fragile economic recovery outlook would still be subject to uncertainties. Thus there remained a need to monitor the outbreak situation following the re-opening of the country, the momentum of fiscal support, and the pass-through of global energy prices, as these factors would affect the economic recovery going forward. Overall liquidity remained ample but credit risks remained a challenge to liquidity distribution, particularly to SMEs and households. The special loan facility for businesses helped in part alleviate the problem. Government bond yields increased in tandem with those of developed markets. On exchange rates, the baht relative to the US dollar exhibited more volatile movements owing to monetary policy in advanced economies and uncertainties in the Thai 2 economic recovery outlook. The Committee would closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets, and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem, particularly through supporting SMEs in hedging against risks from exchange rate volatility. The Committee viewed that the government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery. Public health measures should strike a balance between containing the outbreak and supporting the recovery of economic activities particularly after the re-opening of the country. Fiscal measures should be more targeted in facilitating the economic recovery by focusing on generating income and expediting measures to rebuild and enhance potential growth. Monetary policy should contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions overall. Financial and credit measures should be expedited to distribute liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner and help reduce debt burden. These measures included the special loan facility, asset warehousing scheme, and other measures by specialized financial institutions (SFIs). In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring in a sustainable manner through the scheme launched on September 3, 2021 to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers' long-term debt serviceability. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery. In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook, namely the outbreak situation following the re-opening of the country, the adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures, and the global energy price pass-through. The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary."
Mexico,2021-11-11,"World economic activity continued to recover during the third quarter, although at a slower pace and heterogeneously across countries, associated with the evolution of the pandemic and with spending programs. Global inflation continued increasing due to pressures originated by bottlenecks in production, stimulus spending and its reallocation towards merchandise, the rise in food and energy prices, and the reopening of certain services. In the United States, the Federal Reserve announced the reduction in its asset-purchase program, and the central banks of other advanced economies are expected to begin withdrawing the monetary stimulus, while a large number of emerging market economies continue reducing it. Among key global risks are those associated with the pandemic, inflationary pressures, and adjustments in monetary and financial conditions. In domestic financial markets, the peso exchange rate exhibited volatility and depreciated slightly, short- term interest rates increased, and long-term ones were influenced by external conditions. Preliminary information indicates that the Mexican economy contracted during the third quarter, although it is expected to resume its recovery starting in the fourth quarter. An environment of uncertainty persists and slack conditions are anticipated, with significant differences across sectors. Global and domestic inflationary pressures continue affecting annual headline and core inflation, which in October registered 6.24% and 5.19%, respectively. Headline and core inflation expectations for 2021, for the next 12 months, and for 2022, increased again, while those for longer terms have remained stable at levels above the target. Headline and core inflation forecasts were revised upwards, especially shorter-term ones (see table). Their annual variations are expected to decrease, particularly for one year and beyond, and converge to the 3% target by the end of the forecast horizon. These projections are subject to risks. On the upside: external inflationary pressures; cost-related pressures; core inflation persistence; exchange rate depreciation; and increases in agricultural and livestock product prices and in energy prices. On the downside: a widening of the negative output gap; social distancing measures; and exchange rate appreciation. The balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon deteriorated and remains biased to the upside. The shocks that have increased inflation are largely considered to be transitory. Nevertheless, the horizon in which they could affect it is unknown, and they have involved a wide range of products, while being of considerable magnitude. This poses greater risks to the price formation process and to inflation expectations. For this reason, it was deemed necessary to continue reinforcing the monetary policy stance, adjusting it to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast 1 horizon. The Governing Board decided to increase the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 5%. For the next monetary policy decisions, the Governing Board will assess thoroughly the behavior of inflationary pressures as well as of all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen trajectory for inflation and its expectations. The latter, in order to adopt a policy rate that is consistent at all times with the trajectory needed to facilitate the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets. Voting in favor of the decision were Alejandro DÃ­az de LeÃ³n. Galia Borja. Irene Espinosa, and Jonathan Heath. Voting in favor of leaving the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 4.75% was Gerardo Esquivel. 2 / F o re c a s t a s o f S e p te m b e r 2 0 2 1.

Peru,2021-11-11,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT NOVEMBER 2021 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 2.0% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 50 bps to 2.0 percent. Monetary policy is still expansionary and the current decision does not necessarily imply a cycle of successive increases in the reference rate. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation increased from 5.23 percent in September to 5.83 percent in October, temporarily above the target range due mainly to a surge in international food and fuel prices, as well as exchange rate depreciation. Year-on-year core inflation was 2.79 percent in October. Inflation is expected to return to the target range in the second half of next year, as transitory pressures (exchange rate and international fuel and grain prices) recede, with economic activity below potential. One-year-ahead expected inflation remained at 3.6 percent in October and is forecast at 3.3 percent for 2022, slightly above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most indicators of expectations for economic activity improved in October, although a few remain in pessimistic territory. The current improvement in global economic activity, although at a slower pace, is expected to continue into the next quarters, as the vaccination rollout continues around the world and significant stimulus packages are implemented in developed countries. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation expectations and economic activity, with an aim to consider, if necessary, changes in the monetary stance. Based on the available information, the Board sees the convenience of maintaining an expansionary stance for an extended period through a gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows. In a context of uncertainty, financial volatility persists, with BCRP policies aiming at mitigating it. The Board also decided to raise the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 1.85 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 2.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on December 9, 2021."
Hungary,2021-11-16,"At its meeting on 16 November 2021, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 17 November 2021:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. The global economic recovery has continued at a slowing pace in recent months, while the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic has led to a renewed increase in risks surrounding the recovery. Inflation rose to decade highs in several countries, which was further aggravated by disruptions in supply in a growing number of markets, in addition to persistent rises in commodity and energy prices. Global investor sentiment has deteriorated since the Council's previous policy decision and the probability of tensions in financial markets has increased. The spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus, difficulties becoming more common in supply and the persistent energy crisis also had an adverse effect on investor sentiment. In commodity markets, a significant wave of price increases has occurred. In the case of energy sources, the rise in prices was extraordinarily high; the prices of natural gas and electricity have multiplied since the beginning of the year. The world market price of crude oil remained above USD 80. Overall, the US dollar appreciated against the euro and most emerging market currencies. The policy stances of the world's leading central banks became tighter. At their November policy meeting, the decision-makers of the Federal Reserve decided to start phasing out the asset purchase programme. The European Central Bank slowed the pace of purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Programme (PEPP) in September, and based on the ECB's communication, a decision will be taken in December on the further use of the asset purchase programme. In the CEE region, the Polish and Czech central banks sped up the pace of interest rate hikes, and the Romanian central bank continued to raise its policy rate at a constant rate in November. Hungarian economic growth has continued, but its dynamics has slowed. According to the release of preliminary data. GDP grew by 6.1 percent in annual terms in the third quarter of 2021, leaving it 0.7 percent above its pre-crisis level. A wide range of sectors contributed to growth, but there were differences. In September industrial output declined and construction output increased. The volume of retail sales continued to rise in September, approaching pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate remained low in international comparison. Looking ahead, based on high frequency data economic growth is expected to continue in the fourth quarter, but at a slower pace than before. Hungary's GDP is expected to grow by between 6.5 and 7 percent in 2021 and by between 5 and 6 percent in 2022. Over the short term, the impact of declining industrial production due to weakening external demand and supply disruptions will be dampened by further increases in investment and consumption. Domestic demand has been supported by budgetary measures stimulating economic growth, favourable labour market conditions and higher wage growth resulting from the increase in the minimum wage from 2022. The investment rate is likely to rise further from its current high level. Hungarian export performance is expected to rise again as the fourth wave of the pandemic fades, which will be supported by new export capacities built in previous years. In October 2021, annual inflation was 6.5 percent, and core inflation stood at 4.7 percent. Headline inflation rose by 1.0 percentage point and core inflation by 0.7 percentage points compared to the previous month. The rise in inflation was primarily driven by increases in fuel, industrial goods and food prices. The global pick-up in commodity prices is appearing in consumer prices of a growing range of products. Inflation is expected to rise above 7 percent in November. Higher-than-expected and sustained increases in commodity prices are rapidly being incorporated into consumer prices in a buoyant domestic demand environment, leading to rising inflation in general. In addition to the lasting effects of supply, the pick-up in wage growth next year due to the increase in the minimum wage and strong economic growth, the consumer price index is expected to decline only slowly from the end of this year. As a result, inflation is expected to be substantially higher in 2022 as a whole than projected in the September Inflation Report. The extent of the shift in the inflation path will be quantified in the December Inflation Report projection. In the Monetary Council's assessment, inflation is clearly on an upward path along the risk scenarios compared to the September projection. Persistently high commodity and energy prices, rises in international freight costs and increasingly wider supply disruptions continue to point to a higher and more persistent external inflation environment. The tight labour market, coupled with strong wage growth and a higher inflation environment, may lead to increases in inflation expectations and to strengthen second-round inflation risks. The government deficit is expected to fall from this year and the debt-to-GDP ratio to shift to a declining path even taking into account the September issuance of foreign currency denominated bonds. Over the short term, the current account balance is likely to worsen due to deteriorating terms of trade and more subdued export growth, but it is expected to improve again over the forecast horizon as a result of new export capacities and rising net exports. The economy's net lending is likely to stabilise around 3 percent of the GDP, and therefore Hungary's net external debt will continue to fall. In response to the higher inflation path and the risk of increasing second-round effects, the Monetary Council decided to continue tightening monetary conditions at a faster pace. According to today's decision, the central bank base rate rises by 30 basis points to 2.10 percent. The overnight deposit rate was increased to 1.15 percent, while the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates were increased to 3.05 percent. The base rate has risen by 150 basis points since the start of the rate tightening cycle in June. The Monetary Council responds to longer-term internal fundamental changes in the outlook for domestic inflation by applying the interest rate tightening cycle. The Monetary Council considers it a key priority to anchor inflation expectations properly and thereby continuously to mitigate second-round inflation risks. In the persistently changed inflation environment, the Monetary Council intends to shape expectation appropriately by continuing the cycle of base rate hikes. Nevertheless, short-term risks in financial and commodity markets have recently increased, and the Bank must respond to these significant changes quickly and flexibly. The corresponding instrument for this is the one-week central bank deposit. As long as financial and commodity market risks persist, the Bank must be ready to set the interest rate on one-week deposit above the base rate. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at weekly tenders. It remains a key priority for the MNB that short-term rates in every sub-market and at all times should develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. To this end, the MNB will actively use its swap facility providing foreign currency liquidity again at the end of the year, in addition to introducing several new measures. To reduce liquidity in the banking system, the Bank will cease to use the FX swap facility providing forint liquidity. Furthermore, the Bank is also introducing a new, limited, occasional and short-term central bank discount bill that supports the effective sterilisation of liquidity in the financial system. The effectiveness of monetary policy transmission is also facilitated by the modification of the foreign exchange balance ratio (FXBR) regulations by the MNB's Financial Stability Council, which provides more room for banks' activity at the FX swap market. The technical details of the measures will be communicated in a separate press release. In the Council's assessment, a stable liquidity position in the government securities market remains crucial from the perspective of monetary policy transmission. At its September meeting, the Council set the target amount of the MNB's weekly purchases at HUF 40 billion. The MNB continues to use the government securities purchase programme taking a flexible approach to changing the quantity and structure of weekly purchases, to the extent and for the time necessary. The Bank will not sell the stock of government securities on its balance sheet, purchased government securities will be held to maturity. The Monetary Council will set the next target amount of weekly purchases for the following quarter in December. A persistent rise in external inflationary pressures and increasing second-round inflation risks have necessitated more extensive and longer lasting monetary policy tightening. The Council still considers it necessary to continue the interest rate tightening cycle on a monthly basis. The projection of the December Inflation Report will be decisive in determining the further extent of interest rate hikes. The Monetary Council will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes until the outlook for inflation stabilises around the central bank target in a sustainable manner and inflation risks become evenly balanced on the horizon of monetary policy."
Philippines,2021-11-17,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility at 2.0 percent. The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were likewise kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. Latest baseline forecasts are broadly unchanged from the previous assessment round. Average inflation is seen to slightly exceed the upper end of the target band of 2-4 percent in 2021. Meanwhile, inflation is projected to settle close to the midpoint of the target range in 2022 and 2023, as the recent rise in global crude oil prices, the stronger recovery in domestic economic activity, and the slight depreciation of the peso were mostly offset by the lower-than-expected inflation outturns in recent months. Inflation expectations have also remained firmly anchored to the baseline projection path. However, the risks to the inflation outlook have shifted towards the upside for 2022 even as they remain broadly balanced for 2023. Upside risks are mainly linked to the potential impact of weather disturbances on the prices of key food items, petitions for transport fare hikes, and the possibility of a prolonged recovery of domestic pork supply. Strong global demand amid persistent supply-chain bottlenecks could also exert further upward pressures on international commodity prices. The uncertainties in food supply require determined reforms to improve farm productivity and competitiveness. Meanwhile, potential delays in the lifting of domestic containment measures, as well as the emergence of more virulent COVID-19 variants, could dampen prospects for both global and domestic demand and thus temper inflationary pressures. The Monetary Board also observed that economic growth appears to be gaining solid traction, driven by improved mobility and sentiment amid the calibrated relaxation of quarantine protocols and continued progress in the Government's vaccination program. Nevertheless, the Monetary Board noted that sustained measures to safeguard public health and welfare remain crucial to facilitate the recovery in investment and employment. On balance, the sum of new data suggests that there remains scope to hold monetary policy settings steady amid a manageable inflation environment. The Monetary Board maintains that keeping a patient hand on the BSP's policy levers, along with appropriate fiscal and health interventions, will keep the economic recovery more sustainable over the next few quarters. Looking ahead, the BSP will continue to prioritize providing policy support for the economy while keeping an eye on the potential risks to future inflation. The BSP stands ready to respond to potential second-round effects arising from supply-side pressures, in line with its price and financial stability objectives."
Turkiye,2021-11-18,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 16 percent to 15 percent. Despite the recovery in global economic activity in the first half of the year and the increase in the vaccination rate, new variants keep the downside risks to global economic activity alive. Recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. Unfavorable effects of weather conditions in major agricultural commodity exporting countries are observed on global food prices. While the effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation on the back of rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand may last longer than previously anticipated. Accordingly, central banks in advanced economies continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs. Leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of robust external demand. The spread of domestic vaccination throughout the society facilitates the recovery in services, tourism and related sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. While the demand for durable consumer goods slows down, recovery continues in non-durable consumer goods. The improvement in annualized current account is expected to continue in the rest of the year due to the strong upward trend in exports, and the strengthening of this trend is important for the price stability objective. Recent increase in inflation has been driven by supply side factors such as rise in food and import prices, especially in energy, and supply constraints, increase in administered prices and demand developments. The revision in the monetary policy stance began to affect commercial loans positively. In addition, developments in consumer loans are closely monitored. The Committee evaluated the analyses to decompose the impact of demand factors that monetary policy can have an effect, core inflation developments and supply shocks and decided to reduce the policy rate by 100 basis points to 15 percent. The Committee expects that the transitory effects of supply-side factors and other factors beyond monetary policy's control on price increases will persist through the first half of 2022. The Committee will consider to complete the use of the limited room implied by these factors in December. The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2021-11-18,"PRESS STATEMENT 18 November 2021 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Steady advances in vaccination rates have sustained confidence and the global economic recovery this year, even with further waves of the Covid-19 virus expected. Recoveries in emerging market and developing economies will continue to lag those in advanced economies, in large part due to a slower pace of vaccinations. The virus however remains one of a series of current risks to South Africa's economic growth outlook that includes rising inflation, weaker commodity export prices, stagnant investment, and the longer term impact of scarring from the pandemic and the July unrest. The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) forecast for global gross domestic product (GDP) is 5.9% in 2021, slowing to 4.9% in 2022. The SARB's forecast for global growth in 2021 now sits at 6.3% (up from 6.2%), and is unchanged for 2022 and 2023, at MPC Statement 18 November 2021 Page 1. The SARB's forecast for global growth in 2021 now sits at 6.3% (up from 6.2%), and is unchanged for 2022 and 2023, at MPC Statement 18 November 2021 Page 1 4.4%, and 3.3%, respectively.1 GDP growth in our trading partners in 2024 is forecast to be 2.7%. Global economic conditions are now less supportive of emerging and developing economies than in much of this past year. Although policy settings in advanced economies remain accommodative, considerably higher global inflation and rising uncertainty about the normalisation path for interest rates continue to cause financial market turmoil and capital flow volatility. Risk aversion in financial markets has increased. Economies that failed to take advantage of improved global prospects or to reduce large macroeconomic imbalances remain vulnerable. While the domestic economy grew strongly in the first half of 2021, the second half of the year is expected to show mixed results. Overall, we forecast the economy to grow by 5.2% this year (from 5.3%), revised down due to the larger negative effect on output than was previously estimated from the July unrest and other factors. Our revised estimate for third quarter economic growth is -2.5%, compared to the previous -1.2%. For the fourth quarter, we expect a GDP outcome of 2.6%, compared to the previous 1.6%. Despite these quarterly revisions, the annual growth rate in GDP for 2021 reflects a healthy bounceback from the economic effects of the pandemic. In the next two years, economic growth is expected to align with a low rate of potential growth. GDP is expected to grow by 1.7% in 2022 and by 1.8% in 2023, unchanged from the September forecast. GDP growth in 2024 is forecast to be 2.0%. 1 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. The IMF's October World Economic Outlook global forecast for 2022 sits at 4.9%. MPC Statement 18 November 2021 Page 2. MPC Statement 18 November 2021 Page 2 The July unrest, the pandemic and ongoing energy supply constraints are likely to have lasting effects on investor confidence and job creation, impeding recovery in labour-intensive sectors hardest hit by the lockdowns. High export prices are expected to fade, perhaps faster than previously expected. Very weak job creation will moderate household consumption. Investment will remain constrained by the high risk of further loadshedding and ongoing uncertainty. The faster vaccine rollout presents some upside risk to the growth outlook. Overall, and after revisions, the risks to the medium-term domestic growth outlook are assessed to be to the downside. Compared to the September meeting the output gap is broadly unchanged over the forecast period. The current account surplus remains substantial, but is expected to be significantly smaller than our [September] previous projection, at 3.8% of GDP in 2021 (from 4.6%). Prices for important commodity exports such as rhodium, iron ore, coal and platinum have decreased in recent months, some sharply. Oil prices have increased by about 68% year to date compared to the 2020 average price. Alongside higher prices and stronger demand for imported consumer and investment goods, the commodity and oil price movements imply a smaller trade surplus. Whereas a current account surplus of 0.7% of GDP was forecast for next year (2022), we now expect a current account deficit of 0.6% of GDP.2 2 The current account is expected to be in deficit of -1.8% in 2023 (from -0.3%) and -2.5% in 2024. MPC Statement 18 November 2021 Page 3. MPC Statement 18 November 2021 Page 3 Although fiscal risk has eased, financing conditions remain volatile and the yield curve for rand-denominated bonds remains steep. Ten-year bond yields have shown greater sensitivity to global and domestic factors, and sit at about 9.5% at present. For much of the year, generally favourable global financial and economic conditions and strong commodity export prices strengthened the currency above its long-run equilibrium level. In recent months, increased uncertainty about global inflation and policy settings, with a moderation in the terms of trade, have however contributed to a weaker rand exchange rate. Since the September meeting, the rand has depreciated by about 5.9% against the US dollar and now sits below its equilibrium level. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R15.1 to the US dollar, compared with R14.47 at the time of the previous meeting. With ongoing global supply shortages and strong demand, a wide range of prices continues to accelerate, including raw materials, intermediate inputs and food.3 Some of these price increases have passed-through to consumer prices in major economies. Our estimate for inflation in the G3 was revised higher for 2021 to 2.9% (from 2.4%), to 2.4% for 2022 (from 2.0%) and remains unchanged at 1.8% in 2023.4 For 2024. G3 inflation of 1.6% is forecast. Oil prices are revised up for this year, and fuel price inflation is higher at 17.6% (up from 16.1%).5 Local electricity price inflation for 2021 remains at 10.1%, while the 3 World food prices continue to rise. The assumption used for the forecast for world food prices increased from 13.4% in September to 25.4% for the November meeting. 4 The G3 comprises the United States, the Eurozone, and Japan. 5 The forecast for fuel prices in 2022 are revised higher from 3.7% in the September meeting to 4.6% currently. For 2023 and 2024, fuel price inflation is expected to be 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively. Our assumptions are now for oil prices to average $71.5 per barrel in 2021, $73 per barrel in 2022 and $68 per barrel in 2023. An average price of $65 per barrel is expected in 2024. MPC Statement 18 November 2021 Page 4. For 2024, electricity price inflation of 10% is expected. The Bank's forecast reflects higher headline inflation for the 4th quarter, at 5.3% (from 5.0%). For this year and the next two years, headline consumer price inflation is revised slightly higher, to 4.5% for 2021 (from 4.4%), to 4.3% next year (from 4.2%), and to 4.6% in 2023 (from 4.5%). Headline CPI for 2024 is expected to be 4.5%. The forecast for core inflation remains at 3.0% in 2021 and is slightly lower at 3.7% in 2022 (from 3.8%). Core inflation is expected to be slightly higher at 4.4% in 2023 (from 4.3%), and reaches 4.5% in 2024. While the economy continues to expand over the forecast period, core inflation remains subdued by low services price inflation, modest unit labour costs and exchange rates. The risks to the short-term inflation outlook are assessed to the upside. Global producer price and food price inflation continued to surprise higher in recent months and could do so again. Oil prices have increased sharply, with current prices well above our forecasted levels for this year. Electricity prices are higher throughout the forecast and with other administered prices continue to present short- and medium- term risks. Given the moderate medium and long-term inflation projections set out above, a weaker currency, higher domestic import tariffs, and escalating wage demands present additional upside risks to the inflation forecast. MPC Statement 18 November 2021 Page 5. MPC Statement 18 November 2021 Page 5 Average surveyed expectations of future inflation remain at 4.2% for 2021 and 4.4% for 2022. Market-based surveyed expectations for inflation for 2021 are broadly unchanged.6 While the Committee expects inflation to stay close to the mid-point over the forecast period, inflation risks have increased and the level of policy accommodation remains high. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 3.75% per year, with effect from the 19th of November 2021. Three members of the Committee preferred an increase and two members preferred an unchanged stance. The implied policy rate path of the Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) indicates an increase of 25 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2021 and further increases in each quarter of 2022, 2023 and 2024. As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting in response to new data and risks. Given the expected trajectory for headline inflation and upside risks, the Committee believes a gradual rise in the repo rate will be sufficient to keep inflation expectations well anchored and moderate the future path of interest rates. Economic and financial conditions are expected to remain more volatile for the foreseeable future. In this uncertain environment, policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and 6 The (Q3) Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey expectations have not been updated and remain at 4.2%, 4.4% and to 4.5% for the three years. Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) in November expect inflation to be unchanged at 4.5% in 2021, and higher at 4.5% (from 4.4%) in 2022, and unchanged at 4.3% in 2023. Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These now sit at 5.08% for the 5-year (up by 25 bps since the last meeting) and 6.25% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year breakeven inflation sits at 6.54%. MPC Statement 18 November 2021 Page 6. MPC Statement 18 November 2021 Page 6 sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. The MPC will seek to look through temporary price shocks and focus on second round effects. Current repurchase rate levels reflect an accommodative policy stance through the forecast period, keeping financial conditions supportive of credit demand as the economy continues to recover.7 The Bank has ensured adequate liquidity in domestic markets and will continue to closely monitor funding markets for stress. In addition, regulatory relief provided to banks continues to support lending to households and firms. Better anchored expectations of future inflation should keep interest rates lower for longer, and can be realised by achieving a prudent public debt level, increasing the supply of energy, moderating administered price inflation and keeping wage growth in line with productivity gains. Such steps will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy. The real repurchase rate calculation here is based on the 1-quarter ahead inflation forecast.

Pakistan,2021-11-19,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement November 19, 2021. At today's meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the policy rate by 150 basis points to.75 percent. This reflected the MPC's view that since the last meeting, risks related to inflation and the balance of payments have increased while the outlook for growth has continued to improve. The heightened risks related to inflation and balance of payments stem from both global and domestic factors. Across the world, price pressures from Covid-induced disruptions to supply chains and higher energy prices are proving to be larger and longer-lasting than previously anticipated. In response, central banks have generally begun to tighten monetary policy to keep inflation expectations anchored. In Pakistan too, high import prices have contributed to higher-than-expected CPI. SPI, and core inflation outturns. At the same time, there are also emerging signs of demand-side pressures on inflation and inflation expectations of businesses have risen on account of further upside risks from domestic administered prices. With respect to the balance of payments, the current account deficits in September and October have been larger than anticipated, reflecting both rising oil and commodity prices and buoyant domestic demand. The burden of adjusting to these external pressures has largely fallen on the rupee. As result of these developments, the balance of risks has shifted away from growth and toward inflation and the current account faster than expected. Accordingly the MPC was of the view that there is now need to proceed faster to normalize monetary policy to counter inflationary pressures and preserve stability with growth. Today's rate increase is material move in this direction. Looking ahead, the MPC re-iterated that the end goal of mildly positive real interest rates remains unchanged and, given today's move, expects to take measured steps to that end. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Real sector. The economic recovery underway since the start of FY21 continues, as reflected in most high-frequency indicators of domestic demandâincluding automobile sales. POL (petroleum, oil and lubricants) sales, and electricity generationâas well as the strength of imports and tax revenues. Notwithstanding some moderation in September due to high-base effect and some supply chain disruptions. LSM registered broad-based growth of. percent (y/y) in Q1-FY22, led by production of consumer goods (both durable and non- durable), construction-allied, and export industries. In agriculture, production levels of all major Kharif crops except cotton are estimated to have reached all-time highs. Cotton production has also rebounded, with arrivals at ginneries growing by 80 percent as of 1st November compared to the same period last season. Overall the economic recovery appears increasingly durable and self-sustaining, against the backdrop of rapidly falling Covid cases and the government's vigorous vaccination roll-out. Looking ahead, rising input costs and normalization of macroeconomic policies are likely to lead to some moderation in the growth of industrial activity. Nevertheless this could be more than offset by the improved outlook for agriculture, such that risks to the growth forecast of 4-5 percent in FY22 are tilted to the upside. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN External sector. Persistently high international commodity prices and strong domestic activity kept the current account deficit elevated at $3. billion in Q1-FY22. The deficit widened to $1.6 billion in October from $1.13 billion in September due to high energy prices and an uptick in services imports, despite some moderation in non- energy imports. There was also moderate month-on-month decline in exports and remittances. The current account deficit for FY22 is expected to modestly exceed the previous forecast of 2-3 percent of GDP. While the market-based exchange rate has played its due role as shock absorber, it has borne considerable burden in terms of adjusting to the widening current account deficit. The rupee has depreciated by further. percent since the last MPC meeting. The US dollar also appreciated against most emerging market currencies since May as expectations of tapering by the Federal Reserve have been brought forward. However the fall in the value of the rupee since May has been comparatively large. As other adjustment tools normalize, including interest rates and fiscal policy, pressures on the rupee should abate. Fiscal sector. The overall fiscal deficit improved to. percent of GDP in Q1-FY22 from percent in the same period last year. This was driven by above-target growth in FBR tax revenues (38. percent (y/y) despite higher refunds and significant reduction in the sales tax rate on POL. However, non-tax revenue fell by 2. percent (y/y) due to sharp decline in petroleum development levy (PDL) collection. In addition, the primary surplus was 28. percent lower than in Q1-FY21, due to 3 percent (y/y) growth in non-interest spending. Looking ahead, it will be important to achieve the fiscal consolidation planned in the budget to help restrain domestic demand. higher-than-planned primary fiscal deficit would likely worsen the outlook for inflation and the current account, and would undermine the durability of the recovery. Monetary and inflation outlook. Real money supply growth has accelerated in recent months to above trend levels. With the economic recovery on sound footing, there is need to pare back this growth as part of the broader move toward normalizing monetary conditions. The MPC noted that the recent increase in banks' cash reserve requirements would help in this regard. Inflationary pressures have increased considerably since the last MPC meeting, with headline inflation rising from. percent (y/y) in August to percent in September and further to. percent in October, mainly driven by higher energy costs and rise in core inflation. The momentum of inflation has also picked up significantly, with average m/m inflation in the last two months at an elevated percent and all sub- components of the CPI basket showing an acceleration. Core inflation has also picked up in the last two months, rising to. percent (y/y) in both urban and rural areas on the back of house rents, cloth and garments, medicines, footwear, and other components. In addition, inflation expectations of households remain elevated and those of businesses have risen sharply. Looking ahead, global commodity prices and potential further upward adjustments in administered prices of energy pose upside risks to the average inflation forecast of 7-9 percent in FY22. The MPC will continue to carefully monitor developments affecting medium-term prospects for inflation, financial stability and growth and stands ready to respond appropriately. Page."
Israel,2021-11-22,"Israel is continuing to enjoy an expansion of economic activity despite still coping with the COVID-19 virus. However, there is still some uncertainty regarding economic activity in the medium term, particularly regarding the state of the labor market, and in view of the risk of further morbidity cycles in Israel and abroad. The CPI for October increased by 0.1 percent, and inflation over the preceding 12 months declined to 2.3 percent. To date, the only interest rate increases worldwide have been in countries where inflation deviated markedly from their targets, while inflation expectations in Israel are within our target range, and based on forecasts by the Bank of Israel Research Department and by forecasters, the inflation rate is expected to be lower in 12 months from now. Following rapid economic growth in the second quarter, which reflected the process of exiting the crisis, the first estimate of National Accounts data for the third quarter indicates that economic growth slowed, to an annual rate of 2.4 percent. However, growth in the past four quarterswas about 6 percent. During the reviewed period, there was a sharp appreciation of the shekel. The Bank of Israel has completed the $30 billion purchasing program that the Monetary Committee announced at the beginning of the year. However, the Committee emphasizes that this is not an upper boundfor intervention, and that the Bank continues to act taking into account the state of the economy and the continuation of economic activity. Labor market data show that the economy is facing some difficulty returning to the employment and unemployment levels that were typical of the precrisis period. While the broad unemployment rate declinedto about 7 percent in October, the employment rate remained stable. Home prices increased by about 10 percent in the past 12 months, a high rate compared to previous years. The annual rateof increase of rental prices remained relatively moderate. In the global economy, the trend of recovery continues, but there are increasing signs of a slowdown in the growth rate. The global inflation environment remains high and continues to increase, although the central banks and forecasters in the major economies do not expect a significant portion of the increase to persist. Accordingly, monetary tightening around the world is continuing. The Bank of Israel will complete its purchases of government bonds in the markets during December, which will bring to an end the bond market intervention programs that were announced during 2020. The Israeli economy's process of recovery from the crisis continues. However, there are still challenges to economic activity. The Committee will therefore continue to conduct an accommodative monetary policy for a prolonged time, in accordance with the pace of growth, employment, and the path of inflation. This is in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy targets and the recovery of the economy from the crisis, and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, click here. Since the previous interest rate decision, there has been some slowdown in the rate of increase in inflation (Figure 1). The CPI for October increased by 0.1 percent: less than expected: following a 0.2 percent increase in September. Inflation in the past 12 months was 2.3 percent in October (2.1 percent net of energy and fruit and vegetables; Figure 2). The year over year rate of increases in the prices of nontradable components continues its upward trend, while the year over year rate of increase of prices of tradable components declined in October (Figure 3). The upward trend in one-year inflation expectations from all sources continues, with expectations within the target range. However, there is a marked gap between expectations derived from the capital market, which are near the upper bound of the target range, and those of the professional forecasters and the banks, which are lower (Figure 4). Medium- and long-term expectations increased during the reviewed period, and are within the target range (Figure 5). The Monetary Committee continues to closely monitor these developments, and maintains its assessment that there is no concern of an inflationary outbreak. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 4.4 percent against the US dollar, by 5.7 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and by 6.4 percent against the euro (Figure 6). After the rapid expansion of the economy in the second quarter, reflecting the process of exiting the crisis, the first estimate of National Accounts data for the third quarter indicates that economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 2.4 percent (Figure 13). The slowdown in growth was affected by declines in exports and government consumption, and by volatility in vehicle imports. However, growth over the past four quarters was approximately 6 percent (Figure 14). In addition, since the beginning of the year, there has been an accelerated increase in tax revenues. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, the overall net balance of the business sector in October increased, and is now at a level similar to its precrisis level (Figure 15). Goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds, in US dollars) declined slightly in October. However, they remained higher than the prevalent precrisis level. Services exports moderated slightly in August, but are at a high level (Figure 18). Goods imports are continuing their upward trend, and are at high levels in all components (Figure 20). Labor market data show that the economy is facing some difficulty returning to the levels that were typical of the precrisis period. While the broad unemployment rate declined to about 7 percent in October (Figure 21), this was due to a decline in the number of COVID-19 absentees (furlough), while the rate of those unemployed remained stable. At the same time, there was a decline in the number of participants in the labor force (for reasons other than COVID-19), so that there was no increase in the employment rate itself. Following the rapid increase in the first half of the year, the adjusted employment rate (for those aged 15+) has ranged around 59 percent from the second half of July to the end of October, reflecting a gap of about 150,000 employed persons compared with the average employment rate in 2019. Alongside the lack of increase in actual employment, the number of job vacancies continued to increase, to about 143,000 in October (Figure 23). The increase encompasses many industries, notably those hard hit by the crisis (food and hospitality) and those where demand remains high (such as communications). The excess demand for labor has thus far not been reflected in an increased pace of growth in the average wage (Figure 26). Recently there has been increasing certainty regarding wages thanks to the 'package deal' that regulates future wage increases in broad parts of the economy. Home prices increased by about 10 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 10), a high pace compared to previous years. The volume of mortgages taken out in October was lower than the peak figures ofthe previous months, but it remains high, further to the high mortgage volumes since the beginning of the year (Figure 11). Alongside these, the annual rate of increase in rental prices remained relatively moderate. In the domestic capitalmarket, equity prices continue to increase, more than recorded in the main equity indices abroad (Figure 35). Government bond yields and corporate bond spreads declined and areat low levels (Figure 9). The credit market continues to function well,with stable and low interest rates. The Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey shows that financing difficulties among businesses of various sizes remain at levels similar to those prior to the crisis (Figure 12). In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the Bank of Israel utilized special policy tools. The economy's recovery from the crisis makes it possible to end the corporate and government bond purchase programs in December. These programs helped with the orderly functioning of the markets, the strengthening of the transmission from monetary policy to the credit market, the reduction of the interest rate at which companies raised credit in the capital market, and the allocation of additional sources to credit for all industries. The global economy continues its trend of recovery. However, the level of global GDP remains lower than that derived from the precrisis forecasted growth path, and there are increasing signs of some slowdown in the growth rate. Various investment houses revised their growth forecasts slight downward for the US and China (Figures 27). The global Purchasing Managers Index continues to indicate economic expansion, particularly in the services sector (Figure 29). The volume of world trade moderated, but remains at relatively high levels of activity (Figure 28). The main equity indices increased sharply and corporate bond spreads remained low. The disruptions in the production and supply chains continue, but oil prices fell and shipping costs declined slightly during the reviewed period, which may signal the start of a change. The global inflation environment continued to increase and remains high. In some countries, the inflation indices are increasing to levels higher than their central bank targets, but the central banks and forecasters in the major economies do not expect a significant portion of the increase to persist (Figure 31). With this, monetary tightening around the world continues. In the US, there was a further increase in inflation, to a year-over-year level of 6.2 percent, third quarter growth was lower than in previous quarters, and the labor market continues to recover gradually. The Federal Reserve left the federal funds rate unchanged, and announced a contraction in its bond purchasing program. In Europe, there was an increase in morbidity, and some countries began imposing restrictions that may slow the growth rate. Inflation continues to increase, and the ECB left its interest rate unchanged. In China, the growth rate was low, and the slowdown in economic activity continued, particularlyin industrial production. There were interest rate increases in a number of countries where inflation markedly deviated from the central bank target (<b>Figure 32). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on December 6, 2021. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. January 3, 2022, followed by a press briefing by the Governor."
Nigeria,2021-11-23,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 139 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON MONDAY 22nd AND TUESDAY 23rd NOVEMBER 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 22nd and 23rd November 2021, in light of the continued recovery of the global economy and improving output growth in the domestic economy. Though the growth outlook for the global economy for the rest of the year and into 2022 remains favourable, the uneven pace of recovery across countries has persisted. This was driven primarily by country and regional disparities in COVID-19 vaccination rate, size of policy support and regional economic conditions. On the domestic front, the continued support by the monetary and fiscal authorities is sustaining the growth recovery, notwithstanding the persistence of security challenges and legacy infrastructural constraints. The Committee appraised the developments in the global economy, international financial environment and the domestic economy, as well as the outlook for the rest of the year and the first quarter of 2022. Ten (10) members of the Committee attended this meeting. Global Economic Developments Global output growth has remained upbeat as economic agents defy the continued threat posed by the sharp rise in infection rates associated with new strains of the COVID-19 virus. Despite the forecast for a robust recovery of the global economy in 2021, the uneven pace of vaccination across the globe and the continued rise in infection rates by the more fatal and mutating strains of the COVID-19 virus, suggest that the current two-speed recovery of the global economy may persist longer than anticipated. This may, however, be remedied if governments across the globe rally to improve coordination in the distribution of vaccines to aid the early attainment of global herd immunity. The Committee noted that the downside risks to the recovery may persist if the spread of these new variants is not addressed urgently. In light of the above dynamics and associated headwinds, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded its 2021 growth forecast for the global economy from 60 per cent to 59 per cent. It also revised the projection for the Advanced Economies downwards from 56 per cent to 52 per cent. The downgrade was, however, offset by an upgrade of the growth forecast for Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) in 2021. Thus the forecast for the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies was revised upwards to 64 per cent from 63 per cent. Inflation across several Advanced Economies is expected to continue its upward trend into 2022, contrary to earlier expectations of transiency, as commodity prices continue to recover and feeding into energy and goods prices. This is on the backdrop of rising demand, associated with the sustained rebound in global output growth, amid lingering supply constraints. In response to the persistence of price development, the US Federal Reserve Bank has announced its intention to commence tapering its monthly bond-buying programme by the end of November 2021. Other advanced economy central banks have also indicated the likelihood of following suit in the short to medium term. In key Emerging Market and Developing Economies, inflation remained relatively high compared with the Advanced Economies. This is mostly due to supply-side constraints associated with the Pandemic; exchange rate pressures; and other legacy structural problems. The severity of inflationary pressures in this group of economies, however, varies across countries in relation to the specific structure and dynamics of the individual economies. In the global financial markets, equity prices largely maintained a strong post- lockdown recovery, while investors continued to maintain a sizeable hedge in gold, possibly to ease the impact of a rebound of the Pandemic as infection rates continue to rise. The financial markets remained moderately bullish, an indication that investors remain cautious in view of the unabating Pandemic. This is reflected by the price of Gold, which has remained well above pre- Pandemic levels. Domestic Economic Developments According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 403 per cent (year-on -year) in the third quarter of 2021, compared with 501 and -362 per cent in Q2 2021 and Q3 2020, respectively. The growth trajectory has thus, been positive in the last four quarters following the exit from the recession in 2020. Quarter-on-quarter real GDP grew by 1107 per cent in Q3 2021 compared with -079 per cent in the preceding quarter. This improvement in real GDP was driven by growth in both the oil and non-oil sectors by 1205 and 1099 per cent, respectively. The Committee also noted the continued improvement in the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which though, remained below the 50-index point benchmark, rose to 473 index points in October 2021 from 466 index points in September 2021. This improvement indicated a gradual recovery of output growth, driven largely by the increase in new orders associated with rising aggregate demand and upswing in business activities. The Non-Manufacturing PMI, however, declined to 475 index points in October 2021 from 478 index points in September 2021 as uncertainties persisted around the poor security situation. The Committee noted the continued moderation in headline inflation (year-on- year) to 1599 per cent in October 2021 from 1663 per cent in the previous month, the seventh consecutive month of decline. The decrease was attributed to a marginal decline in both the food and core components to 1834 and 1334 per cent in October 2021 from 1957 and 1374 per cent, respectively in September 2021. Inflation however, remained above the Bank's implicit tolerance corridor of 6  9 per cent and above its benchmark policy rate of 115 per cent despite its progressive decline. Observing developments in monetary aggregates, the Committee noted that broad money supply (M3) grew by 710 per cent in October 2021, compared with 472 per cent in September 2021. This was driven by growth in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) by 912 per cent in October 2021, compared with 1071 per cent recorded in September 2021. Net Foreign Assets (NFA), on the other hand, contracted moderately by -150 per cent in October, compared with -2085 per cent in the preceding month. The continued growth in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) was largely driven by increased claims on the Federal Government and other public nonfinancial corporations, private sector and state and local governments. In the financial markets, money market rates oscillated within the standing facilities corridor, reflecting the prevailing liquidity conditions in the banking system. The monthly weighted average Open Buyback (OBB) rate increased to 1218 per cent in October 2021 from 1111 per cent in September 2021, while the monthly weighted average Inter-bank Call rate decreased from 1321 per cent in September 2021, to 1000 per cent in October 2021. The increase in the Open Buyback (OBB) rate reflected the tight liquidity condition in the banking system. The MPC noted the positive performance of the equities market in the review period, with the All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalization(MC) increasing to 43,,19927 and â¦2255 trillion on November 19, 2021, from 39,,21961 and â¦2043 trillion on August 31, 2021. This depicts improved investor sentiment, following impressive corporate earnings of listed companies on the Exchange. This has led to a new bargain hunting drive by investors. The MPC noted that the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and Liquidity Ratio (LR) both remained above their prudential limits at 152 and 412 per cent, respectively. The Non-Performing Loan ratio (NPL) at 53 per cent in October 2021, reflected progressive improvement, compared with 57 per cent in October 2020. The Committee, however, urged the Bank to sustain its tight prudential regime to bring the Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio below the 50 per cent prudential benchmark. The gross external reserves stood at US$4141 billion as at November 18, 2021, compared with US$4134 billion in October 2021, a moderate increase of 017 per cent. Outlook The overall outlook for both the global and domestic economies remain upbeat but for the significant downside risks clouding the path to full recovery. The key risks remain the unabating COVID-19 pandemic and uneven progress in vaccination. As the US Federal Reserve Bank commences scaling down of its monthly bond-buying programme, there is increased likelihood that other advanced economy central banks will follow in the same direction. With this impending development, external financial conditions will likely tighten for most EMDEs, in view of huge capital flow reversals to the Advanced Economies as yields rise. This will no doubt deepen the growth divergence between these two groups of economies. Forecasts for key macroeconomic variables for the Nigerian economy, indicate continuing rebound in growth recovery for the rest of the year. This is expected on the back of continued support by both monetary and fiscal policy, sustained high crude oil prices and most importantly, availability of COVID-19 vaccines as well as high turnout for vaccination in Nigeria. Accordingly the Nigerian economy is forecast to grow in 2021 by 310 per cent (CBN), 30 per cent (FGN) and 26 per cent (IMF). Inflation is expected to continue its downward trajectory as the harvest season sets in and the government works on improving the security situation to ease the bottlenecks constraining food supply. The Committee's Considerations The Committee commended the continued recovery in output growth following a positive outcome in the third quarter of 2021. Based on the current outlook for price development and growth. Members carefully reviewed the options confronting the Committee in the short to medium term, taking into consideration, key downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation. Members reiterated the need to remain cautious and urged both the monetary and fiscal authorities to sustain their support for the recovery, as the Pandemic was yet to be over. The Committee, however, noted that with the sustained intervention by the Bank, economic activities will normalize in the short to medium term, leading to improved output growth and lower inflationary pressure. The MPC also urged the fiscal authorities to sustain the current effort to revamp the economy through continued support to the critical sectors of the economy. The continued security challenge across the country remained a major source of concern for Members, noting its impact on business confidence, foreign investment inflows and overall economic activities. The persistence of insecurity in major food producing areas, remained a key downside risk to the recovery. The Committee called on security agencies in the country to increase their presence in order to boost public confidence and facilitate the movement of people, goods and services across the country. With improved security, especially in these food producing areas. Members expressed optimism that food inflation will drop significantly following successful harvests and distribution. The Committee also commended the gradual diversification of the economy with the increased contribution of the non-oil sector to Government revenues and called for more support to increase non-oil exports as a source of foreign exchange earnings into the economy. Members also reiterated the impact of poor infrastructure on rising domestic price levels, urging the Federal Government to prioritize investment in public utilities to improve the business environment. These include transportation networks, power supply, education and health. Following the President's recent international call to investors to channel investments to Nigeria. Members were of the view that funding for such projects could be sourced through equitable partnerships with foreign investors and Nigerians in diaspora. The Committee noted that the equities market remained in a strong position, signposting continued investor confidence in the Nigerian economy. Members thus urged the monetary and fiscal authorities to build on this sustained confidence to attract more Foreign Direct Investment into Nigeria. The MPC welcomed the continued resilience of the banking system in the face of severe shocks to both the domestic and global economies, commending the Bank's Management for maintaining overall stability in the banking system. The Committee thus, called on the Bank to continue to push for increased intermediation as the way forward to reduce unemployment, enhance production, create wealth, and improve aggregate demand to strengthen the recovery. On this note. Members applauded the success achieved by the Bank's various intervention schemes, which have contributed to both the demand and supply sides of the economy. The Committee reviewed the performance of the Bank's various interventions aimed at sustaining recovery of output growth and addressing the downside risks to other external and domestic shocks to the economy. Interventions continued largely in manufacturing/industries, agriculture, energy/infrastructure, healthcare and Micro. Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Under the Targeted Credit Facility, the Bank has disbursed a total of â¦36349 billion to 766,,719 beneficiaries, comprising 638,,070 households and 128, 649 small businesses. Under its Agribusiness Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme (AgSMEIS), the Bank has released â¦13463 billion to 37,,571 entrepreneurs. Between September and October 2021, under the Anchor Borrowers' Programme (ABP), the Bank disbursed â¦4319 billion to support the cultivation of over 250,,000 hectares of maize, sorghum, soya beans and rice during the 2021 dry season; and â¦588 billion to finance six large-scale agricultural projects under the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme (CACS). Cumulatively the Bank has disbursed the total sum of â¦864 billion to 41 million farmers, cultivating 502 million hectares. The bank also disbursed the sum of â¦412 billion for the commencement of the brown revolution, a large-scale wheat program to wean us off imports by 35 per cent in the first year. In addition, the Bank disbursed the sum of â¦26192 billion for 42 additional projects under the â¦1 trillion manufacturing intervention. Cumulatively the bank has disbursed the sum of N108 trillion under this Scheme. As part of its effort to support the resilience of the healthcare sector, the Bank disbursed â¦539 billion to Nine healthcare projects under the Healthcare Sector Intervention Facility (HSIF). The Bank has also cumulatively disbursed the sum of â¦10865 billion to hospitals and pharmaceutical industry. 54 of the 117 projects funded are for hospital services. Committee was gratified that the funding under Health sector has resulted in establishment of two new Cancer Centers, over 59 MRI and more than 42 CT Scan Centers in Nigeria, within the last 18 months To further promote entrepreneurship development among Nigerian youth, the Bank recently approved the implementation of the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES). The Scheme is designed to create a paradigm shift among undergraduates and graduates of tertiary institutions in Nigeria, from white-collar jobs towards entrepreneurship development. The guidelines for the implementation of the Scheme was recently published, as Bank of Industry (BOI) is presently partnering with the Bank for the pilot implementation phase. Under the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP), â¦869 billion was disbursed to four Distribution Companies (DisCos) under the scheme's Phase-0. The sum of â¦4766 billion has been disbursed so far for the acquisition of 858,,026 meters. Also in furtherance of its intervention in the energy sector, the Bank released â¦2703 billion to power sector players under the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Payment Assurance Facility (NBET-PAF). This is in addition to the â¦3769 billion disbursed to eight Distribution Companies (DisCos) recently, under the Nigeria Electricity Market Stabilisation Facility (NEMSF-2). The Bank has disbursed the sum of â¦392bn under the Nigerian gas expansion program to promote the migration to compressed natural gas (CNG) as the preferred fuel for transportation and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as the preferred cooking fuel. Furthermore the Bank recently introduced the 100 for 100 Policy on Production and Productivity (PPP), designed to create the flow of finance and investments to enterprises with potential to kick-start a sustainable economic growth trajectory, accelerate structural transformation, promote diversification, and improve productivity in the country. It is geared to support private sector companies with the aim of reducing certain imports, increasing non-oil exports and improving the FX-generating capacity of the economy. The Bank will select and finance 100 of such companies at 100 day intervals, in line with detailed selection criteria as contained in the guidelines, and roll this over for another 100 companies for the next 100 days. The Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) was particularly highlighted by the Committee for its contribution to alleviating poverty at the grassroot. The Committee thus urged the Bank to continue its support through the TCF to ensure that more people benefit from this programme. With the announcement to commence monetary policy normalization by the US Fed and impending interest rate liftoff by central banks in some advanced economies, the MPC called on the Federal Government to intensify its drive towards a counter-cyclical fiscal policy in view of the imminent tightening of external financial conditions. Committee members, therefore, noted with concern that the gradual normalization of monetary policy by this group of economies would dampen the recovery of several Emerging Market and Developing Economies in the short to medium term due to the sharp reversal of capital flows. The Committee also evaluated the developments in China relating to the re- occurring Pandemic, power outages and crisis in the property market, noting the likely impact these could have on Nigeria as a major trading partner. Members thus called on the Bank to ensure that the necessary buffers are put in place to shield the economy from the downside risks associated with these developments. In general. Members expressed confidence in the ongoing policies of both the monetary and fiscal authorities which in their view was the hallmark of the current recovery and restoration of macroeconomic stability in Nigeria. They therefore, called on both authorities to look beyond the current position and plan towards attracting sustainable investment flows to Nigeria. The Committee's Decision At this meeting. MPC was gratified that its policy actions in the past had started to yield positive results given the remarkable improvement in GDP which stood at 403 per cent during Q3 of 2021 and the 6th consecutive month moderation in inflation to 1599 per cent in October 2021. Given the level of its conviction about the efficacy of its actions on macroeconomic variables. MPC felt that whereas tightening would further help to rein in inflation aggressively, it nevertheless feels that tightening will increase cost of funds and constrain output growth. On the other hand, whereas loosening will lower policy rates, ease liquidity pressures, and stimulate additional credit creation which will boost output growth. MPC also thinks that loosening will further widen the negative real interest rate gap and compound the price distortions in the money markets which could fuel inflationary pressures. As for whether to hold its existing stance. MPC believes that the existing monetary policy stance has supported the growth recovery and should be allowed to continue for a little longer for consolidation to achieve the MPC mandate of price stability that is conducive for sustainable growth. The Committee also feels that a hold stance will enable it to carefully appraise the implications of the unfolding global development around policy tapering and normalization by advanced economies. Based on the foregoing, the Committee decided to hold all policy parameters constant to support the enabling environment for sustained recovery. The Committee thus, decided by a unanimous vote to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 115 per cent. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Retain the MPR at 115 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 275 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 23rd November 2021."
South Korea,2021-11-25,"The bank of korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 0.75% to 1.00%. Currently available information suggests that the global economy has continued to recover despite the spread of COVID-19 variants, supported by accelerated vaccinations and the relaxation of restrictions on economic activity in major countries. In global financial markets, the volatility of government bond yields has increased and the US dollar has strengthened, affected by concerns over the prospect of prolonged global inflation and changes in expectations about monetary policy in major countries. Stock prices, especially in advanced economies, have risen, mainly driven by favorable corporate performances. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by global inflation movements and monetary policy changes in major countries. The Korean economy has continued its sound recovery. Although facilities investment has somewhat slowed due to global supply constraints, exports have sustained their buoyancy and private consumption has shown rapid improvement supported by accelerated vaccinations and the easing of domestic COVID-19 restrictions. Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with a sustained year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed. Going forward, the improvement of private consumption is likely to strengthen, while exports and investment are expected to sustain favorable movements. GDP growth is projected to be around 4% in 2021 and around 3% in 2022, consistent with the forecast in August. Consumer price inflation has risen to the lower-3% level due to the accelerating increase in the prices of petroleum products and the base effect from the decline in the prices of public services last year. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has risen to the mid-2% level. The inflation expectations of the general public have increased to the upper-2% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will run considerably above 2%, exceeding the path projected in August, and then decline gradually, running at around 2% for 2022 as a whole. Core inflation is forecast to increase to the upper-1% level. In domestic financial markets, the Korean Treasury bond yield has increased, especially the 3-year yield, due to heightened expectations for monetary policy normalization at home and abroad. Stock prices have risen slightly, affected by stock price movements in major countries, and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fallen. The amount of increase in household loans has lessened somewhat, and housing prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to sustain the recovery of economic growth and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board will appropriately adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation as the Korean economy is expected to continue its sound growth and inflation to run above the target level for a considerable time, despite underlying uncertainties over the virus. In this process the Board will judge when to further adjust the degree of accommodation while thoroughly assessing developments related to COVID-19, changes in the pace of growth and inflation, the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, and monetary policy changes in major countries."
Kazakhstan,2021-12-06,"Press-Release  30 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.75% December 6, 2021 Nur-Sultan The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to set the base rate at 9.75% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1.00 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities set on 10.75% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 8.75%. The decision was taken due to the observed signs of a slowdown in overall inflation, as well as increased uncertainty about the new strain of coronavirus  omicron and its impact on inflationary processes, external and domestic demand. As a result of the outpacing growth of demand over supply opportunities, the trend towards accelerating inflation in many countries persists, despite the measures taken to curb price growth. In the main trading partner countries, with the exception of China, inflation is formed at historical highs. Price growth in Kazakhstan is also at high levels. A slight slowdown in food inflation and the inflation of paid services was offset by an acceleration in prices for non-food products. The increased inflationary expectations of the population strengthen the existing inflationary background. The domestic economy continues to recover actively given relatively high prices on commodity markets and the easing of quarantine restrictions. Pro-inflationary processes in the world economy are increasing. This is due to the rapid recovery of global consumer demand, which is stimulated by the weakening of quarantine measures, high accumulated savings, as well as the realization of pent-up demand. Supply growth is still lagging behind rapidly growing demand due to supply constraints and material shortages. Among the external factors, rising energy prices and disruption of global supply chains should be highlighted, which, despite some improvement in the situation in seaports, are still far from pre- covid levels. In November 2021, the Baltic Dry Index declined from its peak level in October. However, it is still 6 times higher than the level of May 2020. An additional contribution to the acceleration of global inflation is also made by rising food prices, which is associated with a decrease in supply, worsening weather conditions in exporting countries, as well as increased freight prices. The FAO food price index in November increased by 1.2% on a monthly basis, reaching the highest level since June 2011. All these factors lead to a further acceleration of inflation in the world, including Kazakhstan's trading partners. Inflation in the EU and Russia is at historically maximum levels, amounting to 4.4% and 8.1%, respectively, in October 2021. Pro-inflationary pressure from the external sector is reflected in the growth of domestic prices. According to the results of November 2021, annual inflation in Kazakhstan slowed down slightly and amounted to 8.7% compared to 8.9% in October this year. This dynamics was due to a slowdown in the growth of prices for food products from 11.3% to 10.9% and paid services from 6.9% to 6.4%. A significant contribution to the current slowdown in the growth of the food component was made by disinflation for oils and fats, sugar and eggs in the conditions of stabilization of monthly dynamics and a high base of the previous year. At the same time, in November 2021, prices for bakery products and cereals, meat products continued to rise, which is associated with increased costs of producers, a decrease in the gross harvest of grain crops. In November 2021, annual non-food inflation accelerated from 7.8% to 8.3% as a result of the continued growth of prices for fuels and lubricants, solid fuels. The annual growth of consumer prices for fuel and lubricants amounted to 22.3% (monthly growth - 4.3%): the cost of gasoline increased by 18.4% (2.4%), diesel fuel - by 46.6% (14.6%). The increase in the cost of fuel occurs due to the rising producer prices. The annual growth rate of prices for paid services in November 2021 slowed to 6.4%. This is due to a slowdown in the growth of prices for regulated utilities, catering services, hairdressers and personal service establishments. At the same time, the growth of rental rates has accelerated. According to the National Bank's estimates, the seasonally adjusted annualized consumer price growth in recent months has shown a slowdown from the peak in June, amounting to 5.6% in November 2021 (in October  7.1%). Monthly estimates of annualized core inflation indicate the formation of inflationary processes for the second month in a row within the target range of 4-6%. It is important how the dynamics of sustainable components will be fixed in the target corridor in December 2021 and in 2022. In this regard, there is high uncertainty about the stability of this dynamics with unstable and high inflation expectations. Inflation expectations of the population have increased, putting additional pressure on prices. The quantitative assessment of inflation for the year ahead in November 2021 reached 10.8%. 35% of respondents expect an acceleration in price growth in the next 12 months, which was the maximum value during observations. The perception of inflation in recent months has also remained at a high level. The dynamics of economic activity is developing according to the optimistic scenario of the previous forecast round, rapidly recovering. This is happening due to high world prices on commodity markets and the easing of quarantine restrictions. GDP growth in Kazakhstan in January-October 2021 amounted to 3.5% at an oil price of 69.3 US dollars per barrel for the same period. Mining and manufacturing, trade, construction, information and communications, transport and the public sector made a positive contribution. Agriculture has a restraining effect on economic growth, which showed a reduction in production for the first 10 months of 2021. The main reason for this dynamics was a decrease in the gross harvest of grain crops. Economic activity is supported by the recovery in real household demand. In the second quarter of 2021, household consumption increased by 8.1%, amid the realization of pent-up demand for non-food goods and services. An additional factor in this growth in population demand is the effect of the statistical base of the second quarter of 2020, when demand was limited by strict quarantine measures, and the drop was about 16%. An indicator of the continuing positive dynamics of demand is the current expansion of retail turnover (by 6.1% in 10 months of 2021) and an increase in real incomes of the population (by 5.8% in the third quarter of 2021). At the same time, a full recovery in demand continues to limit periodic spikes in the spread of COVID-19, as was observed in late July and early September 2021. A certain correction is being observed on the world oil market after a long rise in prices. In late November and early December, prices fell to $ 65-66 per barrel due to concerns about the spread of a new strain of coronavirus. Despite the emergence of certain events that affect the growth of volatility in the market, the balance of risks does not shift towards the worsening. At the OPEC+ 2 meeting on December 2 this year, it was decided to maintain the current parameters of the deal, providing for a planned increase in production by 400 thousand barrels per day. The EIA estimates that global oil demand will remain strong until mid-2022. Oil supply will grow at a more moderate pace. The oil deficit will prevail on the market. Starting from the second half of 2022, oil supply growth will begin to outpace demand growth due to a decrease in OPEC + cuts and an increase in production by non-OPEC countries. Nevertheless, according to the estimates of international organizations, the oil market as a whole will be characterized by positive dynamics. This will mainly be driven by the normalization of the growth rate of the global economy as the post- pandemic recovery progresses. Saudi Arabia has increased its selling prices for oil with deliveries in January 2022 for Asia and the United States, which signals the confidence of the world's largest oil producer in the prospects for high demand in the oil market, despite the spread of a new strain of coronavirus. Taking into account the current situation and forecasts of international organizations, the baseline scenario of economic development was increased from $ 60 to $ 70 per barrel, the optimistic one - to $ 80 per barrel, and the pessimistic one - to $ 60 per barrel. According to the updated baseline scenario, the expected GDP growth in Kazakhstan by the end of 2021 remains at the level of 3.7-4.0%. The main contribution is expected from domestic demand and exports. Household consumption will continue to recover further amid growing household incomes and a brisk growth in consumer lending. The growth of gross savings will be associated with the growth of investments of enterprises in the main sectors of the economy. Additional support will be provided by investments in housing construction. At the same time, against the background of growing domestic demand, imports will restrain faster GDP growth. There will be a recovery in exports amid a gradual easing of OPEC + restrictions on daily oil production, as well as an increase in economic activity in trading partner countries. A negative contribution will be observed from the side of government consumption due to a slowdown in government spending on wages and the purchase of goods and services. The GDP growth rate in 2022 has been revised down slightly and is expected to reach 3.9- 4.2%. The revision is associated with a moderate increase in economic activity in the trading partner countries of Kazakhstan and a more negative impact of disruptions in global and local supply chains on the Kazakhstan economy. Economic growth will be facilitated by a gradual improvement in the epidemiological situation and an increase in energy production compared to 2021. The trajectory of the output gap has been revised downwards compared to the previous forecast round. This relates to lower estimates on the growth of the components of aggregate demand and economic activity in general. In the medium term, the output gap will be at near-zero levels. Taking into account the current dynamics of price growth, the National Bank expects that inflation will be in the range of 8.5-8.7% by the end of 2021. With further effective implementation of the Anti-Inflationary Response Package by the Government and local executive bodies, inflation will form close to the lower limit of the forecast range. In the short term, the expected acceleration of inflation of non-food goods and services will be offset by a further slowdown in the growth of food prices. A moderate increase in the cost of paid services is expected, which will be due to the preservation of the current pricing in the market of regulated housing and communal services. The upward pressure on prices will be exerted by the preservation of the external inflationary background, the acceleration of inflationary processes in non-food markets, the recovery of consumer activity, high inflation expectations and the indirect effect of rising fuel prices through an increase in the cost of goods and services. There are also risks 3 of further growth of electricity tariffs against the background of the expected increase in coal prices. The peak of inflation is expected in the first quarter of 2022, after which there will be a gradual slowdown. In the medium term, a higher external inflationary background is expected compared to previous estimates. This is due to the upward revision of inflation in the trading partner countries of Kazakhstan and higher dynamics of external food prices. A more restrained trajectory of the output gap will compensate for the influence of external factors on the medium-term dynamics of inflation. In 2022, inflation is expected to gradually slow down to 6.0-6.5%, taking into account the continued implementation of the Anti-Inflationary Response Package. The decline in inflation will be supported by a high base formed in 2021. At the same time, the realization of pro-inflationary risks associated with imbalances in certain markets for goods and services, interruptions in global and local supply chains and persistence of high inflationary expectations, may lead to the formation of inflation above the forecast value in 2022. The next decision will be taken by the National Bank given the dynamics of inflationary expectations, stable components of inflation, as well as the impact of the epidemiological situation on external and internal demand. With an unstable deceleration of expectations, inflation and its stable components, the National Bank will continue to tighten monetary conditions more decisively. The next planned decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on January 24, 2022 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time.

Brazil,2021-12-08,"In its 243rd meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate to 9.25% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, a possible reversion, even if partial, of the increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency would produce a lower-than-projected inflation in the baseline scenario. On the other hand, further extensions of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that increase aggregate demand and deteriorate the fiscal path may pressure the country's risk premium. In spite of the more positive public accounts data, the Committee assesses that doubts regarding the fiscal framework increase the risk of deanchoring inflation expectations, keeping the upward asymmetry in the balance of risks. This implies a higher probability of inflation paths above the one projected under the baseline scenario. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to increase the Selic rate by 1.50 p.p. to 9.25% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2022 and 2023. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full employment. The Committee considers that, given the increase in its inflation projections and in the risk of a deanchoring of long-term expectations, it is appropriate to advance the process of monetary tightening significantly into the restrictive territory. The Committee will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process and the expectation anchoring around its targets consolidate. For the next meeting, the Committee foresees another adjustment of the same magnitude. The Copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic activity, on the balance of risks, and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fabio Kanczuk. Fernanda Magalhaes Rumenos Guardado. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Georgia,2021-12-08,"08.12.2021 The National Bank of Georgia raises the monetary policy rate by 0.5 percentage points to 10.5 percent On December 8, 2021, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia decided to increase the refinancing rate by 0.5 pp. The monetary policy rate is 10.5 percent. The extraordinary situation caused by the pandemic has created many challenges for the world economy, with high inflationary environment to be particularly concerning. Increased inflation remains one of the main recent issues for Georgia as well. Annual inflation slightly declined to 12.5 percent in November. Even though the recent inflation figure is mainly driven by temporary exogenous factors, it is high nevertheless. According to the preliminary estimates of the NBG, the contribution of such exogenous factors to the headline inflation is about 9 pp in November. A surge in consumer commodity prices on international markets is of particular importance, which is transmitted to the local market through imported raw materials and final goods. Although the exchange rate has appreciated relatively year-on-year, the imported inflation was 18 percent in November. The statistical methodological impact of the utility tax subsidy on current inflation is also noteworthy. As noted in previous committee decisions, it will have a temporary additional contribution to the annual inflation rate in December 2021 and January-February 2022. As for the aggregate demand, since the second quarter of 2021 it has significantly rebounded, which is due to several factors. One of them is the fiscal stimulus: although the budget deficit declined annually, its level is still high, which supports a high level of domestic demand. Moreover, the stronger-than- expected pent-up demand in the second quarter of 2021 speeded up the recovery of economic activity. Moreover, the recent increase in domestic demand has been supported by an accelerated lending growth as well. Strong domestic demand is a positive push for current economic activity, however, at the same time it hinders the aim of reducing inflation. The increased differential between interest rates on lari and foreign currency loans, due to the tightening of monetary policy, contributes to a recent foreign currency lending growth, which is a source of foreign exchange risks in the economy. To prevent the accumulation of such risks, the Financial Stability Committee has taken additional measures, which will also help to improve the efficiency of monetary policy in the medium term. Given strong supply shocks, it is also important to make sure that prolonged high level of inflation does not transmit to long-term inflation expectations. Taking into account these factors, the Committee decided to further tighten monetary policy and increased the policy rate to 10.5 percent. Inflation is expected to increase temporarily in the coming months due to the above-mentioned base effect of the utility bill subsidy, although it will start declining from spring. The gradual reduction of inflation, along with the fading-out of one-off factors, will be facilitated by planned fiscal consolidation and tighter monetary policy. A precondition for the future reduction of the policy rate will be significantly reduced inflation and inflationary expectations. In the wake of the global economic recovery, external demand continues to grow. In January-October exports increased by about 25 percent annually, while the increase compared to the same period in 2019 is 11 percent. Revenues from international travelers have almost doubled annually based on ten months data, although the decline from the 2019 level is still significant (65 percent). Imports have also increased, against the backdrop of higher domestic demand: in January-October it grew by 22 percent year-on-year, whereas compared to 2019 the growth is about 3 percent. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the MPC will be held on February 2, 2022."
India,2021-12-08,"Monetary Policy Statement, 2021-22 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) December 6-8, 2021 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (December 8, 2021) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. The reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Since the MPC's meeting during October 6-8, 2021, surges of infections across geographies, emergence of the Omicron variant, the persistence of supply chain disruptions and elevated energy and commodity prices continue to weigh on global economic activity. Global merchandise trade is slowing after a sharp rebound from the pandemic due to the disruptions in port services and turnaround time, elevated freight rates and the global shortage of semiconductor chips, which could dampen future manufacturing output and trade. The composite global purchasing managers' index (PMI), however, improved to a four-month high in November, with services continuing to perform better than manufacturing for eight consecutive months.2 3. Commodity prices remain elevated across the board, though there has been some softening since late October and further drop towards end-November following uncertainties from the new COVID-19 variant, among others. Headline inflation in several advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) has soared, prompting a number of central banks to continue tightening and others to bring forward policy normalisation. With the US Federal Reserve commencing tapering of its monthly asset purchases and the possibility of faster taper, renewed bouts of volatility and heightened uncertainties have unsettled global financial markets. Bond yields which had risen in most countries, responding to inflation and monetary policy actions, eased from the last week of November. The US dollar has been trading higher in recent weeks against both AE and EME currencies. Domestic Economy 4. On the domestic front, data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on November 30, 2021 showed that real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 8.4 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q2:2021-22, following a growth of 20.1 per cent during Q1:2021-22. With the recovery gaining momentum, all constituents of aggregate demand entered the expansion zone, with exports and imports markedly exceeding their pre-COVID-19 levels. On the supply side, real gross value added (GVA) increased by 8.5 per cent y-o-y during Q2:2021-22. Available data for Q3:2021-22 indicate that the momentum of economic activity is gaining further traction, aided by expanding vaccination coverage, the rapid subsiding of new infections and release of pent-up demand. Rural demand exhibited resilience  tractor sales improved in October over the same month of 2019 (pre- pandemic level), while motorcycle sales are slowly inching towards their pre- pandemic levels. Continued direct transfers under PM Kisan scheme are supporting rural demand. The demand for work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) moderated in November from a year ago, suggesting a pickup in farm labour demand. Supported by favourable soil moisture content and good reservoir storage levels, rabi sowing was 6.1 per cent higher than a year ago as on December 3, 2021. Urban demand and contact-intensive services activities are rebounding on improving consumer optimism, supported by festival demand. High-frequency indicators such as electricity demand, railway freight traffic, port cargo, toll collections, and petroleum consumption registered robust growth in October/November over the corresponding months of 2019. Automobile sales, steel consumption and air passenger traffic still remained below 2019 levels even though they gained momentum in October as supply side shortages eased. Investment activity is exhibiting modest signs of improvement  production of capital goods remained above pre-pandemic levels for the third month in a row during September, while import of capital goods in October rose at double-digit pace over its level two years ago. Prints of manufacturing and services PMIs for November 2021 suggested continued improvement in economic activity. Exports grew in November for the ninth month in a row, along with a surge in non-oil non-gold imports on the back of reviving domestic demand.3 7. Headline CPI inflation, which has been on a downward trajectory since June 2021, edged up to 4.5 per cent in October from 4.3 per cent in September on account of a spike in vegetable prices  due to crop damage from heavy rainfalls in October in several states, and fuel inflation  driven up by international prices of liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene. In fact, fuel inflation at 14.3 per cent in October surged to an all-time high. Core inflation or CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained elevated at 5.9 per cent during September-October with continuing upside pressures stemming from clothing and footwear, health, and transportation and communication sub-groups. Liquidity conditions remained in large surplus, with daily absorptions through the fixed rate reverse repo and the variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) operations under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) averaging â¹8.6 lakh crore in October- November. Reserve money (adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in the cash reserve ratio) expanded by 7.9 per cent (y-o-y) on December 3, 2021. Money supply (M3) and bank credit by commercial banks grew y-o-y by 9.5 per cent and 7.0 per cent respectively, as on November 19, 2021. India's foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 58.9 billion in 2021-22 (up to December 3, 2021) to US$ 635.9 billion. Outlook 9. The inflation trajectory, going forward, will be conditioned by a number of factors. The flare-up in vegetables prices due to heavy rains in October and November is likely to reverse with the winter arrivals. Rabi sowing is progressing well and is set to exceed last year's acreage. Recent pro-active supply side interventions by the Government continue to restrain the pass-through of elevated international edible oil prices to domestic retail inflation. Crude prices have seen a significant correction in recent period. Cost-push pressures from high industrial raw material prices, transportation costs, and global logistics and supply chain bottlenecks continue to impinge on core inflation. The slack in the economy is muting the pass- through of rising input costs to output prices. Taking into consideration all these factors. CPI inflation is projected at 5.3 per cent for 2021-22; 5.1 per cent in Q3; 5.7 per cent in Q4:2021-22, with risks broadly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2022-23 is projected at 5.0 per cent and for Q2 at 5.0 per cent (Chart 1). The recovery in domestic economic activity is turning increasingly broad- based, with the expanding vaccination coverage, slump in fresh COVID-19 cases and rapid normalisation of mobility. Rural demand is expected to remain resilient. The spurt in contact-intensive activities and pent-up demand will continue to bolster urban demand. The government's infrastructure push, the widening of the performance- linked incentive scheme, structural reforms, recovering capacity utilisation and benign liquidity and financial conditions provide conducive conditions for private investment demand. The Reserve Bank's surveys point to improving business outlook and consumer confidence. On the other hand, volatile commodity prices, persisting global supply disruptions, new mutations of the virus and financial market volatility pose downside risks to the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration and assuming no resurgence in COVID-19 infections in India, the projection for real GDP growth is retained at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22 consisting of 6.6 per cent in Q3; and 6.0 per cent in Q4:2021-22. Real GDP growth is projected at 17.2 per cent for Q1:2022- 23 and at 7.8 per cent for Q2 (Chart 2).4 11. The impact of the recent spike in vegetables prices on food inflation prints is expected to dissipate as the usual softening of prices in the winter sets in. The partial roll back of Central excise and State Value Added Taxes (VAT) on petrol and diesel in November have eased retail selling prices and will have second round effects over a period of time. Crude oil has seen some correction but remains volatile. Core inflation will need to be closely monitored and held in check. For a sustained lowering of core inflation, continuing the normalisation of excise duties and VATs alongside measures to address other input cost pressures assume critical importance, more so as demand improves. The domestic recovery is gaining traction, but activity is just about catching up with pre-pandemic levels and will have to be assiduously nurtured by conducive policy settings till it takes root and becomes self- sustaining. In particular, private investment has to lead the revival of the economy, along with the strong impetus being provided by exports. Private consumption, despite strong recovery in Q2:2021-22, remains below its pre-pandemic level and demand for contact-intensive services could potentially face headwinds if authorities take pre-emptive steps to contain the fallout of Omicron. Downside risks remain significant rendering the outlook highly uncertain, especially on account of global spillovers, the potential resurgence in COVID-19 infections with new mutations, persisting shortages and bottlenecks and the widening divergences in policy actions and stances across the world as inflationary pressures persist. A tightening of global financial conditions poses risks to global economic activity and to India's prospects as well. Against this backdrop, the MPC has judged that the ongoing domestic recovery needs sustained policy support to make it more broad-based. Considering it appropriate to wait for growth signals to become solidly entrenched while remaining watchful on inflation dynamics, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and to continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.5 12. All members of the MPC  Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma. Dr.Mridul K. Saggar. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das  unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent. All members, namely. Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Dr.Mridul K. Saggar. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das, except Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published on December 22, 2021. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during February 7-9, 2022. (Yogesh Dayal) Press Release: 2021-2022/1322 Chief General Manager."
Poland,2021-12-08,"Warsaw, 8 December 2021 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 8 December 2021 The Council decided to increase the NBP reference rate by 0.50 percentage points, i.e. to 1.75%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: âª lombard rate at 2.25%; âª deposit rate at 1.25%; âª rediscount rate at 1.80%; âª discount rate at 1.85%. The activity in global economy continues to recover, yet economic conditions are under a negative impact of supply-side constraints in some markets, high commodity prices and re-escalation of the pandemic in certain countries, including the euro area. Latest forecasts indicate that GDP growth in 2022 will remain relatively robust, although lower than in 2021. The emergence of a new variant of coronavirus contributed to higher uncertainty regarding further course of the global epidemic and economic developments, and hence to some deterioration of sentiment in the global financial markets and an increase in risk aversion. Commodity prices  in particular prices of natural gas, oil, coal, as well as of some agricultural commodities  remain markedly higher than a year ago. Together with continued global supply chain disruptions and still high international shipping costs, and amid recovery in demand, this contributes to a marked rise in inflation globally, which in many countries has reached highest levels in decades. Moreover, also inflation forecasts for the coming quarters have been revised up, which points to the risk of longer than previously judged impact of pandemic shock on inflationary processes. Against this background some central banks are withdrawing monetary accommodation, however, decisions of monetary authorities are not homogenous and take into account conditions for conducting monetary policy in particular economies. Central banks in the Central-Eastern Europe region have been increasing interest rates. The ECB, despite inflation being the highest in the euro area history, keeps negative interest rates and continues big scale asset purchases. In turn, the US Federal Reserve keeps interest rates close to zero, but at the same time signals the possibility of a more rapid deceleration of 1/3 asset purchases, which together with an increase in risk aversion leads to an appreciation pressures on the US dollar in global markets. In Poland, economic activity continues to recover, despite another wave of increase in infections. Robust economic conditions are reflected in preliminary estimate of GDP, according to which annual GDP growth in 2021 Q3 stood at 5.3%, accompanied by a significant acceleration in investment. Data on industrial production, retail sales and construction and assembly output for October 2021 point to a solid increase in economic activity also in 2021 Q4. The situation in the labour market likewise continues to improve, as indicated by decreasing unemployment and a marked increase in average wage. In the coming quarters economic conditions are expected to remain favourable. However, there are uncertainty factors related to the impact of the pandemic on global and domestic economic conditions, as well as to the effects of supply-side constraints and high energy commodity prices on the economy. Inflation in Poland, according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate for November 2021, increased to 7.7% in annual terms, and in monthly terms it amounted to 1.0%. The elevated inflation resulted, to a great extent, from external factors beyond the control of domestic monetary policy, such as higher than a year ago global prices of energy and agricultural commodities, earlier increase in electricity prices and in waste disposal charges, as well as rising prices of goods, whose supply has been constrained by global pandemic disruptions. The ongoing economic recovery, including demand driven by rising household income, has also added to the price growth. The rise in global prices of both energy and agricultural commodities observed this year, record high increase in prices of CO2 emission allowances, as well as continued global supply chain disruptions have led to significant rise in inflation in Poland, which is going to remain at an elevated level also in the coming period. The so-called Anti-inflationary Shield announced by the government will have a curbing impact on inflation. In a longer perspective, inflation will decrease, which will be supported by expected fading of some global shocks currently boosting price growth, as well as by an increase in the NBP interest rates. At the same time, amidst further economic recovery and expected continuation of favourable labour market conditions, as well as probably more lasting impact of external shocks on price dynamics, there persists a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. In order to reduce this risk, i.e. striving to decrease inflation to the NBP target in the medium term, 2/3 the Council decided to increase NBP interest rates again. The increase of the NBP interest rates will also curb inflation expectations. Decisions of the Council in the coming months will continue to be aimed at reducing inflation to a level consistent with the NBP inflation target in the medium term, while taking into account economic conditions, so as to ensure medium-term price stability and at the same time support sustainable economic growth after the global pandemic shock. The Council's assessment regarding the total scale of monetary tightening necessary for achieving these goals will consider incoming information on perspectives for inflation and economic growth, including situation in the labour market. NBP may still intervene in the foreign exchange market and use other instruments envisaged in the Monetary Policy Guidelines. The timing and scale of the measures taken by NBP will depend on the market conditions."
Peru,2021-12-09,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT DECEMBER 2021 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 2.5% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 50 bps to 2.50 percent. Monetary policy is still expansionary and the current decision does not necessarily imply a cycle of successive increases in the reference rate. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation decreased from 5.83 percent in October to 5.66 percent in November, temporarily above the target range due mainly to a surge in international food and fuel prices, as well as exchange rate depreciation. Year-on-year core inflation was 2.91 percent in November. Inflation is expected to return to the target range in the second half of next year, as transitory pressures (exchange rate and international fuel and grain prices) recede, with economic activity below potential. One-year-ahead expected inflation increased from 3.6 percent in October to 3.7 percent in November and is forecast at 3.5 percent for 2022, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most indicators of expectations for economic activity deteriorated in November, and a few are located in pessimistic territory. Global economic activity is improving, although at a slower pace due to new COVID-19 outbreaks, the emergence of new variants, and bottlenecks in global supply of goods and services. This recovery is expected to continue into the next quarters, as the vaccination rollout continues around the world and significant stimulus packages are implemented in developed countries. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation expectations and economic activity, with an aim to consider, if necessary, changes in the monetary stance. Based on the available information, the Board sees the convenience of maintaining an expansionary stance for an extended period through a gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows. In a context of uncertainty, financial volatility persists, with BCRP policies aiming at mitigating it. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 1.85 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 3.0 percent per year. The schedule of monetary policy meetings for the next twelve months is the following: January 6 February 10 March 10 April 7 May 12 June 9 July 7 August 11 September 8 October 6 November 10 December 7."
Ukraine,2021-12-09,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to raise the key policy rate to 9% per annum. The decision is aimed at neutralizing the impact of additional pro-inflationary risks, improving inflation expectations, and ensuring steady disinflation toward the target of 5%. The inflation surge has passed its peak, but inflation is declining slower than expected. The growth in consumer prices decelerated to 10.9% yoy in October. The NBU estimates inflation continued to slow in November. This was supported by the vanished effect of the last year's low comparison base, better harvests gathered this year, administrative decisions on public utility rates, and the impact of previous decisions to tighten the monetary policy. Effects of the current weakening of the hryvnia against the U.S. dollar are partially offset by the hryvnia's strengthening against the currencies of Ukraine's other major trading partners. However, disinflation is slow due to a number of factors. In particular, second-round effects from rises in food and energy prices put higher pressures on prices of an increasingly wider list of consumer-basket goods and services. Inflation is also fueled by businesses' higher expenses on logistics and wages. In addition, domestic consumer demand remains robust despite a slight deterioration in consumer confidence and quarantine restrictions. As a result, the current inflation trajectory remains higher than expected in the October macroeconomic forecast of the NBU. Additional pro-inflationary risks are also materializing. Rising geopolitical tensions are affecting prices of Ukrainian assets and FX market conditions. Considering the current situation, global natural gas and food prices are likely going to be higher than expected. Global inflation continues to accelerate, prompting leading central banks to step up their monetary policy tightening. In turn, this lowers investor interest in assets of emerging markets. Inflation will continue to decline gradually at the end of this year and throughout the entire 2022. Food inflation will decelerate due to both large harvests gathered this year and a correction of global prices in 2022. Natural gas prices in Europe are also expected to go down in spring, after the heating season is over. The underlying pressure will also ease gradually in view of the expected slower growth in wages next year and the sustained effect of monetary policy tightening by the NBU. Progress achieved in cooperation with the IMF is a key factor for reducing uncertainty. In late November, the IMF Executive Board made a decision to give Ukraine a second tranche of about USD 700 million (in the equivalent) under the current stand-by arrangement, while also extending the arrangement. Continued cooperation with the IMF and other official lenders will help the government carry out key reforms and facilitate the rapid recovery of the Ukrainian economy from the coronavirus crisis. Key risks to the economy are posed by an escalation of the military conflict with Russia and a longer global price surge than expected earlier. Considerable uncertainty over whether or not the military conflict will escalate could worsen expectations, in particular inflation expectations, and cause investors to put off their investment decisions, which would dampen economic recovery. A related geopolitical risk arises from high gas prices persisting longer than envisaged in the forecast. The risk of a further increase in global food prices also remains important. Through second-round effects, these factors could push up prices for an increasingly larger number of goods and services. Prolonged and higher global inflation, especially a surge in inflation in central and eastern Europe, could also put pressures on domestic prices in Ukraine. A faster-than-expected monetary response by leading central banks poses the risk of there being capital outflows from emerging markets. The economic repercussions arising from the spread of new coronavirus variants are creating a lot of uncertainty. However, these repercussions could increase the risk of global stagflation on the back of logistic and production problems. The NBU continues to assess the balance of risks for its baseline scenario of inflation and the key policy rate as having tilted to the upside. With a view to offsetting the impact of several pro-inflationary factors that have materialized since the last monetary policy meeting and that could prevent inflation from decelerating to its target, the NBU Board decided to raise the key policy rate to 9% per annum. If pro-inflationary factors continue to materialize, the NBU stands ready to raise its key policy rate at the next Board meetings on monetary policy issues. The decision to raise the key policy rate, to 9% was approved by NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No. 608, dated 9 December 2021. A summary of the discussion between Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 20 December 2021. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 20 January 2022, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
Thailand,2021-12-13,"Outcome of the Joint Meeting between the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 8 December 2021 The Bank of Thailand (BOT) announced the outcome of the joint meeting between the MPC and the FIPC on 8 December 2021, to assess risks to Thailand's financial stability. Key discussion points were as follows. The committees concluded that Thailand's financial stability remained resilient overall. Commercial banks held ample level of capital, loan loss provision and liquidity buffers, and would be capable of accommodating loan demand to support the economic recovery going forward. Financial positions of insurance companies remained robust, with the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic limited to a few insurance firms offering COVID-19 insurance coverage and measures already been put in place to contain the adverse impact toward financial stability. Financial markets remained sound and continued to function normally. In recent months, regulatory authorities had enacted several measures to safeguard financial stability and provide support to households and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic continuously. Examples of the measures enacted by the BOT include measures to facilitate long-term sustainable debt restructuring, measures to support consolidation of mortgages and other retail debt held at different banks, measures to relax maximum credit line restriction debt installment period and ( minimum debt payment rate, rehabilitation loan, and an asset warehousing program. Meanwhile the Office of Insurance Commission (OIC) announced measures to mitigate the adverse impact on the COVID-19 insurance policyholders and ease capital and liquidity regulations to provide flexibility for insurance companies, with an aim to reduce regulatory burden stemming from the COVID-19 insurance claims and give firms more options to find other sources of funding and replenish liquidity. In addition, the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released measures to provide pandemic-hit businesses with alternative funding channels, such as issuing regulations to facilitate setting up of high-yield bond funds, stressed bond funds, and REIT buy-back trust fund. However amidst the uncertainties over the new COVID-19 viral mutation and the potential impact on the economic recovery, the committees viewed that there remained the need to ensure that these measures achieved their objectives together with the need to assess their adequacy against the backdrop of the economic recovery. Looking ahead, key risk factors warranted monitoring would include the severity of the Omicron variant, the efficacy of vaccines and pandemic containment measures, and the possibility of re- introducing lockdown measures under severe scenarios. Under this environment, apart from supporting the continuity of economic recovery, the committees agreed that preparing measures and policy instruments to address risks potentially emerging in the medium term (2-3 years) would be essential. Such preparation would necessitate effective policy coordination among regulatory authorities. The committees highlighted the importance of limiting risks to financial stability in two priority areas as follows. Addressing the issue of elevated household debt level, which could affect credit quality of financial institutions and hinder economic recovery in the periods ahead. Assistance measures for highly indebted retail borrowers, particularly measures aiming to incentivize financial institutions to accelerate debt restructuring for viable retail borrowers with high debt burden in a sustainable manner, should be expedited. In addition, preparation of measures aiming to slow down new debt creation by ensuring that the same supervision standards across all types of financial service providers must be achieved and addressing debt problem along with supporting household income and promoting borrowers' financial literacy must be warranted in order to improve the situation of household debt and that household sector could escape the debt trap eventually. Containing spillover of risks across sectors in the financial system. One such risk was the volatility in the corporate bond market which could affect investors, savings co-operatives, or mutual funds, and funding costs of corporates. Synchronous collaboration between regulators and related government agencies to prepare policy instruments and enhance supervisory standards, in order to limit the potential transmission of risks and build up resilience of the financial system to withstand any changes and uncertainties that could arise in the future, would be essential. This would include imposing measures to mitigate risks of large conglomerates, both in the banking sector and the capital markets through bond issuance activities, in tandem with introducing measures to reduce investment concentration of savings co-operatives and more stringent liquidity regulations of mutual funds. The BOT, the SEC and the OIC would continue to collaborate closely in assessing risks, especially the impact of new viral variant outbreak which could interrupt the recovery of Thai economic activities, monitoring the adequacy and effectiveness of measures undertaken, and preparing measures and policy instruments, particularly those which required policy coordination between regulators and relevant government agencies, to deal with risks potentially materializing in the medium term."
Armenia,2021-12-14,"PRESS RELEASE 14.12.2021 At December 14, 2021 meeting, the CBA Board decided to raise refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage points, setting it at 7.75%. Inflation in November 2021 totaled 1.7%, compared to 1.3% in the same month of the previous year, as a result of which the 12-month inflation grew to 9.6%. After stable performance in recent months, the 12-month core inflation increased in November,, reaching 8.4%. Strong recovery of economic activity and aggregate demand in the main partner countries of Armenia continues. In such a situation, amid remaining supply bottlenecks, a significant expansion of the inflationary environment is observed in international commodity and food markets. The latter is further reflected in the substantial acceleration of domestic inflation in partner countries as compared to previous projections. In order to mitigate high inflation expectations and to achieve the inflation target. Central Banks of partner countries continue to tighten monetary conditions. Altogether, it is expected an increase in inflationary impact from the external sector on the Armenian economy. Thecurrent economic activity in Armenia is estimated to be lower than expected, mainly because of the slowdown of growth in agriculture and industry. Still, positive demand developments carry on, which is currently supported by external demand due to higher-than-expected growth rates of tourism. Against the background of inflationary effects from the external sector and positive demand conditions, certain acceleration of quarterly core inflation and inflation expectations is estimated. In view of the upsurge of inflationary impacts from the external sector, as well as the estimated developments in inflation expectations, the Board judges appropriate to increase the refinancing rate. The 12-month inflation is projected to gradually decrease, approaching the target of 4% in the medium-term forecast horizon, and stabilize around it. The CBA Board assesses that amid the still uncertain economic outlook, the risks of inflation deviating from the projected medium-term path are mainly upward, and should they materialize, the Board stands ready to respond accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective. Detailed information on the interest rate decision will be available in the Inflation Report to be published by December 28, 2021 (Monetary Policy Program for QIV, 2021).

Chile,2021-12-14,"NoPtrae sdse R eplereasnes*a Tuesday, 14 December 2021 Monetary Policy Meeting  December 2021 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 125 basis points to 4.0%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of its members. On the external front, the outlook for global activity has moderated, especially for emerging economies. The persistence of global supply restrictions has continued to impact the performance of certain sectors, in a context where pandemicârelated risks are still present. Inflation has continued to rise, reaching high levels and showing signs of further persistence in several countries. As a result, more central banks have joined in the removal of the substantial monetary stimuli applied during the crisis, changing their view of current inflation as transitory. In this context, there has been an appreciation of the dollar and a mixed performance in the stock markets. The price of a barrel of oil has fallen by around 10% with respect to the last meeting, while copper remains at around US$4.3 per pound. The performance of the Chilean financial market continues to be closely linked to idiosyncratic elements. In the fixedâincome market, shortâterm interest rates have risen in line with the monetary policy stance. Although 10âyear rates have fallen by around 130bp since the last meeting, they are still well above their earlyâyear levels and have accumulated a much higher increase than in comparable economies. With ups and downs, the peso depreciated again from its levels at the time of the previous meeting. The dynamics of bank credit continue to show a limited performance of loans in the different portfolios, combining weaker demand and supply. The tightening of lending conditions is especially visible for mortgage credit and other longerâterm loans. At the same time, interest rates have continued to rise in all segments. In line with forecasts of the September MP Report, activity showed significant dynamism in the third quarter, posting annual expansion of 17.2% and an annualized quarterly expansion rate that climbed to 21% in seasonally adjusted terms. Domestic demand grew more than expected, driven by strong private consumption. Investment in machinery and equipment also showed good performance, while construction and works was able to recover its preâpandemic levels. In October, the Imacec once again recorded high annual growth rates (15%), although its seasonallyâadjusted monthly growth rate slowed down with respect to previous months. In this context, private expectations have revised the expected growth for this year upwards, from 11% in October to 11.9% in December. The labor market continues to recover gradually, which has been held back by the reduced supply of workers, especially visible in some sectors and segments of the population. Household and business expectations have recently declined, marked in part by greater concerns about inflation. Annual inflation rose further in recent months, to 6.7% as of November. Worth noting is the rise in volatile prices (10.5% annually in November), especially for fuels, foodstuffs, and services that picked up after the pandemic. Core CPI's annual variationâi.e., the CPI minus volatile pricesâ was 4.7% in November, in line with the projections in the September MP Report. Various expected inflation measures have increased in recent months and, while some moderation is foreseen towards 2023, in the 24âmonth horizon they place it above 3%. Nota de prensa The Board foresees that the MPR will be further increased in the short term, to exceed its nominal neutral level âi.e., the one that is consistent with the 3% inflation targetâ during much of the monetary policy horizon. This will help the economy to resolve its cumulative imbalances, which have contributed to the fast increase in inflation. This will result in the gradual closing of the activity gap, helping to prevent the recent inflationary dynamics from having a persistent impact on the price formation process. The Monetary Policy Report to be published tomorrow morning contains the details of the central scenario, its surrounding sensitivities and risks, and its implications for the evolution of the monetary policy rate. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Report will be released at 8:30 hours of Wednesday 29 December 2021. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will be held on Tuesday 25 and Wednesday 26 January 2022 and the statement thereof will be published at 18 hours of the second meeting day.

Hungary,2021-12-14,"At its meeting on 14 December 2021, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 15 December 2021:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. The global economic recovery has slowed in recent months, while the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic and the emergence of the new variant of the virus led to a renewed increase in risks surrounding the recovery. Inflation rose to levels not seen for several decades in a number of countries, which was further aggravated by disruptions in supply across a growing range of markets, in addition to persistent rises in commodity and energy prices. Global investor sentiment has deteriorated since the Council's previous policy decision. Risk appetite has been driven by rising inflation, the related monetary policy messages, and the spread of the Delta and Omicron variants of coronavirus. In commodity markets, a significant wave of price increases occurred in the autumn months. In the case of energy sources, the rise in prices was extraordinarily high; the prices of natural gas and electricity have multiplied since the beginning of the year. The global market price of crude oil fell, but it is significantly above its level a year earlier. Movements in the US dollar have been mixed against developed market currencies, while it tended to strengthen against emerging market currencies. At the same time, a withdrawal of capital began from emerging markets. The policy stances of the world's leading central banks have become tighter. In line with its November decision, the Federal Reserve started phasing out its asset purchase programme. Based on the Bank's communication at the end of November, the phasing out of asset purchases might proceed at a faster pace than earlier announced, which is expected to be discussed at the December policy meeting. According to its communication, the European Central Bank will take a decision in December on the future use of the asset purchase programme. In the CEE region, the Polish central bank continued to raise its policy rate in December. Hungarian economic growth has continued, but its dynamics has slowed. GDP grew by 6.1 percent in annual terms in the third quarter of 2021, thus exceeding its pre-crisis level by 0.7 percent. A wide range of sectors contributed to growth, but there were differences in dynamics across sectors. In October, industrial output continued to decline, reflecting subdued production due to the global shortage of semiconductors. Construction output continued to grow, supported by government investment activity and the strong housing market. The volume of retail sales continued to rise in October, slightly exceeding its pre-pandemic level. The unemployment rate remains steadily low even in international comparison. The Hungarian economy has a strong ability to recover. Economic growth is expected to continue at a slower pace, while the structure of growth shows a dichotomy. Disruptions in international production chains, as well as rising commodity and energy prices, lead to a slowdown in the economic recovery, while the further strengthening in domestic demand cushions the effects of external factors. Household consumption growth continues, supported by the increase in the minimum wage next year and the government measures aimed at boosting household income. In addition to the increase in the minimum wage, the tight labour market also helps to maintain rapid wage growth. Higher commodity and energy prices, and weaker external demand are likely to hold back corporate investment activity in 2022. However, the investment rate is expected to stabilise at a high level even compared to the EU. As a result of the temporary slowdown in exports, reflecting the effects of external factors, and stronger domestic demand, net exports are likely to have a nearly neutral impact on GDP growth in 2022. In the second half of next year, exports are expected to rebound quickly as external markets and supply chains recover, which will also be supported by new export capacities. Hungarian GDP is expected to grow by 6.36.5 percent in 2021 and by 4.05.0 percent in 2022. In November 2021, annual inflation was 7.4 percent, and core inflation stood at 5.3 percent. Headline inflation rose by 0.9 percentage points and core inflation by 0.6 percentage points on the previous month. The rise in inflation affected a wide range of goods and services. The global pick-up in commodity prices is appearing in consumer prices for a growing range of goods. Consumer prices are expected to rise by 5.1 percent in 2021 as a whole. Inflation reached its peak in November, and it is expected to fall gradually from December. Short-term developments in inflation are determined by the fading impact of base and tax effects, the introduction of a cap on fuel prices and the extent of repricing at the beginning of the year. Core inflation will rise in the coming months and will be close to 6 percent by mid-2022, reflecting the rise in commodity and energy prices, increases in freight costs, and increasingly wider supply disruptions. Over the medium term, anchoring inflation expectations at a level consistent with the inflation target will play a crucial role in the achievement of price stability. Core inflation excluding the effects of tax changes is expected to follow a downward path from the second half of next year as a result of the Bank's proactive measures and as the effects of the pandemic and the external inflation environment fade gradually. Inflation is expected to return to the central bank tolerance band in the fourth quarter of 2022, before reaching the 3 percent central bank target in the first half of 2023. The consumer price index is projected to be 4.75.1 percent in 2022 and to be consistent with the inflation target from 2023. The government deficit and the government debt-to-GDP ratio are expected to shift to a declining path from this year. The current account balance is likely to worsen due to the temporary effects of the pandemic, but to increase as external markets and supply chains recover, which will be supported by new export capacities built up in recent years. As a result, the current account balance is expected to show a deficit of three percent of GDP this year and next, and then to improve gradually toward the end of the forecast horizon. At the same time, the economy's net lending is likely to increase following a temporary decline in 2021 and 2022, and will be around 1 percent of GDP at the end of the forecast horizon. In order to avoid second-round inflationary effects and to properly anchor expectations, the Monetary Council continues the tightening of monetary conditions. According to today's decision, the central bank base rate rises by 30 basis points to 2.40 percent. The overnight deposit rate was increased by 80 basis points to 2.40 percent which is equal to the base rate, while the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates were increased by 30 basis points to 4.40 percent. The Monetary Council considers it a key priority to anchor inflation expectations properly and thereby continuously to mitigate second-round inflation risks. In the persistently changed inflation environment, the Monetary Council intends to drive expectations appropriately by continuing the cycle of base rate hikes at a monthly frequency and in a predictable manner. Rising yields as a result of the interest rate hikes and the expected gradual fall in inflation are expected to lead to an increase in real interest rates in the coming months. The Bank continues to intend to respond to the increase in short-term risks in financial and commodity markets quickly, flexibly and to the extent necessary. The interest rate on the one-week central bank deposit has risen above the level of the base rate in recent weeks. The Monetary Council has increased the Bank's room for manoeuvre by making the interest rate corridor asymmetrical. As long as financial and commodity market risks persist, the Bank will be ready to set the one-week deposit rate persistently above the base rate. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at weekly tenders. In the Monetary Council's assessment, raising the interest rate on the one-week central bank deposit at least by as much as the base rate is raised is warranted. It remains a key priority for the MNB that short-term rates in every sub-market and at all times should develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. To this end, the MNB will actively use its swap facility providing foreign currency liquidity again, without a quantitative limit. In this context, the Bank will conduct a total of four tenders in December 2021. In addition, auctions of short-term discount bills will further contribute to the efficient sterilisation of financial system liquidity. The Monetary Council also supports the stability of swap market rates by raising the interest rate on the O/N central bank deposit to the same level as the base rate. The Monetary Council attaches great importance to ensuring that all elements of the Bank's monetary policy toolkit support the return to price stability as soon as possible. In line with this, at its December meeting the Monetary Council decided to close the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme. Following the realisation of negotiations with issuers currently underway up to the maximum amount allocated under the programme, the Bank will not purchase additional corporate bonds. Ample liquidity and strong capital position of the banking sector, as well as the improvement in bond market conditions in recent years and the effects of market development, make it possible to satisfy the corporate sector's funding needs on a market basis. The Monetary Council also took a decision on closing the government securities purchase programme. Accordingly, the Bank will stop purchasing bonds. In the Monetary Council's view, the stable liquidity position of the government securities market is crucial for the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission looking ahead. The MNB will continue to closely monitor liquidity developments in the government securities market, and it will be ready to intervene in order to maintain the stability of the government securities market with occasional and targeted government securities purchases if necessary. Occasional government securities purchases will not indicate a change in the stance of monetary policy. The Bank will hold securities purchased until maturity. In the Council's assessment, the risks to inflation continue to be on the upside. Inflation expectations have risen in recent months. Persistently high commodity and energy prices, the increase in international freight costs and increasingly wider supply disruptions continue to point to more sustained external inflationary pressures. At the same time, the tight labour market, coupled with rising wage growth and a higher inflation environment, may lead to a further rise in inflation expectations and an increase in second-round inflation risks. Mitigating second-round inflation risks and driving expectations appropriately have necessitated longer lasting, predictable monetary policy tightening. The Council still considers it necessary to continue the base rate tightening cycle on a monthly basis. Changes to the one-week central bank deposit rate will feed into the MNB's tightening cycle for a sustained period. By raising the one-week deposit rate, the MNB continues to stand ready to respond to short-term risks in financial and commodity markets quickly and flexibly. The Monetary Council will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes until the outlook for inflation stabilises around the central bank target in a sustainable manner and inflation risks become evenly balanced on the horizon of monetary policy."
Pakistan,2021-12-14,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement December 14, 2021. At today's meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the policy rate by 100 basis points to.75 percent. The goal of this decision is to counter inflationary pressures and ensure that growth remains sustainable. Since the last meeting on 19th November 2021, indicators of activity have remained robust while inflation and the trade deficit have risen further due to both high global prices and domestic economic growth. In November, headline inflation increased to 1. percent (y/y). Core inflation in urban and rural areas also rose to. and. percent, respectively, reflecting domestic demand growth. On the external side, despite record exports, high global commodity prices contributed to significant increase in the import bill. As result, the November trade deficit rose to $5 billion based on PBS data. The MPC noted that recent data releases confirm that the emphasis of monetary policy on moderating inflation and the current account deficit remains appropriate. Following today's rate increase and given the current outlook for the economy, and in particular for inflation and the current account, the MPC felt that the end goal of mildly positive real interest rates on forward-looking basis was now close to being achieved. Looking ahead, the MPC expects monetary policy settings to remain broadly unchanged in the near-term. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Real sector. High-frequency indicators of domestic demand released since the last meeting, including electricity generation, cement dispatches, and sales of fast-moving consumer goods and petroleum products, and continued strength in imports and tax revenues suggest that economic growth remains robust. The outlook for agriculture continues to be strong, supported by better seed availability and an expected increase in the area under wheat cultivation. Meanwhile robust growth in sales tax on services also suggests that the tertiary sector is recovering well. While some activity indicators are moderating on sequential basis, partly as result of recent policy actions to restrain domestic demand, growth this fiscal year is expected to be close to the upper end of the forecast range of 4-5 percent. This projection factors in the expected impact of today's interest rate decision. The emergence of the new Coronavirus variant. Omicron, poses some concerns, but at this stage there is limited information about its severity. The MPC noted that Pakistan had successfully coped with multiple waves of the virus, which supported positive outlook for the economy. External sector. Despite strong exports and remittances, the current account deficit has increased sharply this year due to rise in imports, and recent outturns have been higher than earlier expected. Based on PBS data, imports rose to $32. billion during July-November FY22, compared to $19. billion during the same period last year. Around 70 percent of this increase in imports stems from the sharp rise in global commodity prices, while the rest is attributable to stronger domestic demand. Due to the higher recent outturns, the current account Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN deficit is projected at around percent of GDP, somewhat higher than earlier projected. While in the near term monthly current account and trade deficit figures are likely to remain high, they are expected to gradually moderate in the second half of FY22 as global prices normalize with the easing of supply disruptions and tightening of monetary policy by major central banks. In addition, recent policy actions to moderate domestic demandâincluding policy rate hikes and curbs on consumer financeâand proposed fiscal measures, should help moderate growth in import volumes through the rest of the year. In this context, the MPC emphasized that the monetary policy response to arrest the deterioration in the current account deficit has been timely. Together with the natural moderating influence of the flexible and market-determined exchange rate, the MPC felt that this response would help achieve the goal of sustainable current account deficit this fiscal year. Moreover the MPC noted that the current account deficit is expected to be fully financed from external inflows. As result, foreign exchange reserves should remain at adequate levels through the rest of the fiscal year and resume their growth trajectory as global commodity prices ease and import demand moderates. Fiscal sector. During July-November FY22, fiscal revenue growth has been strong, driven by broad-based and above- target increase in FBR tax collections (36. percent (y/y). However lower petroleum development levy (PDL) collection led to decline in non-tax revenues (22. percent (y/y) in Q1 FY22). On the expenditure side, development spending and subsidies and grants have increased significantly during this period. The government intends to introduce legislation to increase revenues through elimination of certain tax exemptions and reduce current and development expenditures. These measures would help moderate domestic demand, improve the current account outlook, and complement recent monetary policy actions. Monetary and inflation outlook. Since the last meeting, despite moderation in consumer loans, overall credit growth has remained supportive of growth. Meanwhile across all tenors, secondary market yields, benchmark rates and cut-off rates in the government's auctions have risen significantly. The MPC noted that this increase appeared unwarranted. The momentum in inflation has continued since the last MPC meeting, as reflected in significant increase in both headline and core inflation in November. Due to recent higher than expected outturns. SBP expects inflation to average 1 percent this fiscal year. The pick-up in inflation has been broad-based, with electricity charges, motor fuel, house rent, milk and vegetable ghee among the largest contributors. On sequential basis, inflation rose percent (m/m) in November. Looking ahead, based on this momentum and the expected path of energy tariffs, inflation is likely to remain within the revised forecast range for the remainder of the fiscal year. Subsequently as global commodity prices retrench, administered price increases dissipate, and the impact of demand-moderating policies materializes, inflation is expected to decline toward the medium-term target range of 5-7 percent during FY23. The MPC will continue to carefully monitor developments affecting medium-term prospects for inflation, financial stability and growth. Page."
Philippines,2021-12-15,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility at 2.0 percent. The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were likewise kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. The latest baseline forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are slightly higher from the previous assessment round owing to the higher-than-anticipated inflation outturn in November. Nevertheless, the projected inflation path remains within the inflation target band of 2-4 percent over the policy horizon. Average inflation is seen to settle close to the midpoint of the target range in 2023. Inflation expectations also continue to be anchored to the target level. The risks to the inflation outlook also continue to lean towards the upside for 2022 while remaining broadly balanced for 2023. Upside risks are linked mainly to the potential impact of continuing constraints on the supply of key food items and petitions for transport fare hikes. Strong global demand amid lingering supply-chain bottlenecks could also exert further upward pressures on international commodity prices. The effective implementation of non-monetary interventions to ensure adequate domestic food supply must be sustained in order to mitigate potential supply-side pressures on inflation. Meanwhile, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants continues to pose downside risks to the outlook for growth and inflation. Nonetheless, the Monetary Board observed that economic growth now appears to be on firmer ground, supported by the Government's accelerated vaccination program and calibrated relaxation of quarantine protocols. In particular, credit activity has gradually recovered in recent months, reflecting improved business activity and market sentiment. On balance, the Monetary Board sees enough scope to keep a patient hand on the BSP's policy levers owing to a manageable inflation environment. At the same time, downside risks to the economic recovery emanate from the emergence of new COVID-19 variants as well as the potential tightening of global financial conditions. Hence, preserving ongoing monetary policy support at this juncture shall help sustain the economy's momentum over the next few quarters. Looking ahead, the BSP affirms its support for the economy while keeping an eye on the potential risks to future inflation. The BSP stands ready to respond to potential second-round effects arising from supply-side pressures, in line with its price and financial stability objectives."
United States,2021-12-15,"EST December 15, 2021 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months but continue to be affected by COVID-19. Job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks to the economic outlook remain, including from new variants of the virus. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. With inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some time, the Committee expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment. In light of inflation developments and the further improvement in the labor market, the (more) For release at 2 p.m. EST December 15, 2021Committee decided to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. Beginning in January, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $40 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $20 billion per month. The Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, but it is prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook. The Federal Reserve's ongoing purchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C. Williams.

Euroarea,2021-12-16,"The first paragraph of the last question was updated on 17 December 2021 at 14:40 to correct a transcription error. Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. The euro area economy continues to recover and the labour market is improving, helped by ample policy support. Growth is moderating but we expect activity to pick up again strongly in the course of next year. The latest pandemic wave and the Omicron variant have prompted some countries to re-introduce tighter restrictions. And in some industries, there are shortages of materials, equipment and labour. These factors are restraining economic activity and are a headwind for the near-term outlook. However, although the public health crisis is still ongoing, many people have been vaccinated and booster campaigns have accelerated. Overall, society has become better at coping with the pandemic waves and resulting constraints. Inflation has risen sharply owing to the surge in energy prices, and also because demand is outpacing constrained supply in some sectors. Inflation is expected to remain elevated in the near term, but should ease in the course of next year. The inflation outlook has been revised up, but inflation is still projected to settle below our two per cent target over the projection horizon. We judge that the progress on economic recovery and towards our medium-term inflation target permits a step-by-step reduction in the pace of our asset purchases over the coming quarters. But monetary accommodation is still needed for inflation to stabilise at our two per cent inflation target over the medium term. In view of the current uncertainty, we need to maintain flexibility and optionality in the conduct of monetary policy. With this is mind, the Governing Council took the following decisions:. First, in the first quarter of 2022, we expect to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) at a lower pace than in the previous quarter. We will discontinue net asset purchases under the PEPP at the end of March 2022. Second, the Governing Council decided to extend the reinvestment horizon for the PEPP. It now intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. Third, the pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of our monetary policy and made our efforts to achieve our goal more effective. Within our mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability. In particular, in the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic. PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time. This could include purchasing bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the Greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout of the pandemic. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic. Fourth, in line with a step-by-step reduction in asset purchases and to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with inflation stabilising at our target over the medium term, we decided on a monthly net purchase pace of â¬40 billion in the second quarter and â¬30 billion in the third quarter under the asset purchase programme (APP). From October 2022 onwards, we will maintain net asset purchases under the APP at a monthly pace of â¬20 billion for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates. We expect net purchases to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. We also confirmed the level of the key ECB interest rates and our forward guidance on the future path of policy rates. This is crucial for maintaining the appropriate degree of accommodation to stabilise inflation at our two per cent inflation target over the medium term. We will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of TLTRO III operations does not hamper the smooth transmission of our monetary policy. We will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to our monetary policy stance. As announced, we expect the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III to end in June next year. We will also assess the appropriate calibration of our two-tier system for reserve remuneration so that the negative interest rate policy does not limit banks' intermediation capacity in an environment of ample excess liquidity. The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate and in either direction, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its two per cent target over the medium term. I will now outline in more detail how we see developments in the economy and inflation. I will then outline our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. We expect the economic recovery to continue, driven by robust domestic demand. The labour market is improving, with more people having jobs and fewer in job retention schemes. This supports the prospect of rising household income and consumption. The savings built up during the pandemic will also support consumption. The current fiscal and monetary policy support, together with a continued global recovery, should support growth. Economic activity has been moderating over the final quarter of the year and this slower growth is likely to extend into the early part of next year. We now expect output to exceed its pre-pandemic level in the first quarter of 2022. To cope with the current pandemic wave, some euro area countries have reintroduced tighter containment measures. This could delay the recovery, especially in travel, tourism, hospitality and entertainment. The pandemic is weighing on consumer and business confidence and the spread of new virus variants is creating extra uncertainty. In addition, rising energy costs are a headwind for consumption. Shortages of equipment, materials and labour in some sectors are hampering production of manufactured goods, causing delays in construction and slowing down the recovery in some parts of the service sector. These bottlenecks will still be with us for some time, but they should ease during 2022. Looking ahead, we expect growth to rebound strongly over the course of 2022. Our new Eurosystem staff projections foresee annual real GDP growth at 5.1 per cent in 2021, 4.2 per cent in 2022, 2.9 per cent in 2023 and 1.6 per cent in 2024. Compared with our September staff projections, the outlook has been revised down for 2022 and up for 2023. Targeted and growth-friendly fiscal measures should continue to complement monetary policy. This support will also help the economy adjust to the structural changes that are under way. An effective implementation of the Next Generation EU programme and the âFit for 55â package will contribute to a stronger, greener and more even recovery across euro area countries. Inflation is expected to remain elevated in the near term, but we expect it to decline in the course of next year. The upswing in inflation primarily reflects a sharp rise in prices for fuel, gas and electricity. In November, energy inflation accounted for more than half of headline inflation. Demand also continues to outpace constrained supply in certain sectors. The consequences are especially visible in the prices of durable goods and those consumer services that have recently reopened. Base effects related to the end of the VAT cut in Germany are still contributing to higher inflation, but only until the end of the year. There is uncertainty as to how long it will take for these issues to resolve. But, in the course of 2022, we expect energy prices to stabilise, consumption patterns to normalise, and price pressures stemming from global supply bottlenecks to subside. Over time, the gradual return of the economy to full capacity and further improvements in the labour market should support faster growth in wages. Market and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained broadly stable since our last monetary policy meeting in October. But overall, these have moved closer to two per cent in recent months. These factors will help underlying inflation to move up and bring headline inflation up to our target over the medium term. Our new staff projections foresee annual inflation at 2.6 per cent in 2021, 3.2 per cent in 2022, 1.8 per cent in 2023, and 1.8 per cent in 2024 â significantly higher than in the previous projections in September. Inflation excluding food and energy is projected to average 1.4 per cent in 2021, 1.9 per cent in 2022, 1.7 per cent in 2023, and 1.8 per cent in 2024, also higher than in the September projections. Economic activity could outperform our expectations if consumers become more confident and save less than expected. By contrast, the recent worsening of the pandemic, including the spread of new variants, could be a more persistent drag on growth. The future path of energy prices and the pace at which supply bottlenecks are resolved are risks to the recovery and to the outlook for inflation. If price pressures feed through into higher than anticipated wage rises or the economy returns more quickly to full capacity, inflation could turn out to be higher. Market interest rates have remained broadly stable since the October Governing Council meeting. Bank lending rates for firms and households remain at historically low levels. Overall, financing conditions for the economy remain favourable. Lending to firms is partly driven by short-term funding needs stemming from supply bottlenecks that increase their expenses for inventory and working capital. At the same time, corporate demand for loans remains moderate because of retained earnings and generous cash holdings, as well as high debt. Lending to households remains robust â driven by demand for mortgages. Euro area banks have further strengthened their balance sheets thanks to higher capital ratios and fewer non-performing loans. In line with our new monetary policy strategy, twice a year the Governing Council assesses in-depth the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability. An accommodative monetary policy underpins growth, which supports the balance sheets of companies and financial institutions, as well as preventing risks of market fragmentation. At the same time, the impact of accommodative monetary policy on property markets and financial markets warrants close monitoring as a number of medium-term vulnerabilities have intensified. Still, macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence in preserving financial stability and addressing medium-term vulnerabilities. Summing up, the euro area economy continues to recover, despite a slowdown in the near term. The sharp increase in energy prices and demand outpacing constrained supply in some sectors are pushing up inflation. Inflation will remain above our target for most of 2022, but is likely to ease in the course of next year. At the same time, given the progress on economic recovery and towards our medium-term inflation target, we can discontinue net purchases under the PEPP in March. But monetary accommodation is still needed â including net purchases under the APP and our forward guidance on interest rates â for inflation to stabilise at our two per cent inflation target over the medium term."
Egypt,2021-12-16,"Press Release December 16th, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 825 percent, 925 percent, and 875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 875 percen. Annual headline urban inflation declined in October and November 2021, to record 63 percent and 56 percent from 66 percent in September 2021, respectivel. The decline came supported by favorable base effects in November 2021 stemming from the transitory supply shock witnessed in tomato prices during November 202. Hence the deceleration in November 2021 was driven by the lower annual contribution of food items, which more than offset the higher annual contribution of non-food item. Annual food inflation declined in November 2021 for the first time since April 2021, to record 81 percent in November 2021 from 116 percent in October 2021, due to the decline in the annual contribution of volatile food items, despite higher annual contribution of core and regulated food item. On the other hand, annual non-food inflation increased to 45 percent in November 2021 from 40 percent in October 2021, mainly reflecting higher annual contribution of rental values as well as higher prices of cafes and restaurant. Meanwhile annual core inflation continued to increase, for the third consecutive month, to record 52 and 58 percent in October and November 2021, respectively, from 48 percent in September 2021 partially affected by unfavorable base effect. Real GDP growth recorded a preliminary figure of 98 percent in 2021 Q3 compared to 77 percent in 2021 Q2. The aforementioned development reflects the sustained pick-up of domestic economic activity, as well as the partial impact of a positive base effec. Additionally leading indicators point towards a continued expansion across most economic sector. Meanwhile the unemployment rate stabilized at 75 percent in 2021 Q3, compared to 73 percent during the preceding quarte. Along the near outlook horizon, domestic economic activity is expected to be mainly driven by domestic demand, and in specific, gross domestic investment. Furthermore real GDP growth is expected to continue being partially impacted by a positive base effect up until 2021 Q. Global economic activity continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, but has shown some signs of slowdown due to global supply chain disruption. Additionally prospects of global economic recovery remain contingent on the efficacy of vaccines and the ability of countries to contain the spread of the virus, in light of the emergence of newer variant. Global financial conditions are expected to remain accommodative and supportive of economic activity over the medium-ter. International prices for oil have increased at a slower pace, driven by both supply and demand factor. In the meantime, international prices for select mineral commodities have begun to decreas. Against this background, the MPC decided that keeping policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 7 percent (Â±2 percentage points) on average in 2022 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandat.

Mongolia,2021-12-16,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged and setting the refinancing amount No: 2021/04 Date: December 16, 2021 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia held scheduled meetings on December 15-16th, 2021. Taking into consideration current state of the economy and financial markets as well as outlook and risks to the domestic and foreign economic environments, the MPC decided to: 1. Keep the policy rate unchanged at 6 percent; 2. Provide up to MNT 250 billion under the Bank of Mongolia's long-term repo financing instrument in the first quarter of 2022; 3. Set repo financing rate at policy rate + 0.5 percent; 4. Increase the reserve requirement on liabilities in foreign currency by 3 percentage points to 18 percent. Annual headline inflation reached 10.5 percent nationwide and 10.0 percent in Ulaanbaatar city as of November 2021. The rise in inflation is mainly attributable to the supply-driven price increases, induced by border constraints, the spread of infectious livestock diseases and rising transportation costs. The headline inflation is expected to rise in the near term as a result of these factors and expected to stabilize around the central bank's target level in the second half of 2022. However, supply chain disruptions, border constraints and hikes in food and fuel prices beyond expectations may lead to the risk of inflation not returning to lower levels at the rates expected. Therefore, the decision for expanding the targeted purpose of long-term repo financing instruments would help to increase the stockpile of fuel and main food products up to the required level. While the global economy has been recovering and the prices of key export goods have remained high, domestic economic growth undermined expectations for the last two quarters. Though policy measures implemented by the government and central bank have been supporting economic activity and contributing to its recovery, growth outlook is revised down from the previous quarter due to household consumption remaining subdued, border constraints leading to disruptions in foreign trade and supply chain and further resulting in weaker activities in transport, manufacturing, and construction sectors. Keeping the policy rate at the current level would have a positive impact on supporting economic recovery and stabilizing growth. In addition, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to increase the reserve requirement on liabilities in foreign currency by 3 percentage points with the purpose of maintaining relative yield of togrog and reducing the dollarization of bank liabilities. The central bank will adjust its monetary policy stance in a timely manner in line with the developments of economic recovery and inflation outlook. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Mexico,2021-12-16,"Available information shows that world economic growth has increased moderately during the fourth quarter, heterogeneously across countries depending on the evolution of the pandemic and the actions implemented by their public health, monetary and fiscal authorities. World inflation continued increasing due to pressures originated by bottlenecks in production, the reallocation of spending towards merchandise, the rise in food and energy prices, and the recovery of certain services. In the United States, the Federal Reserve announced an acceleration of the removal of monetary stimulus, doubling the pace of reduction of its net asset purchases, and outlining projections for the federal funds rate for 2022 and 2023 with higher increases than expected. Many emerging market economies intensified their respective reference rate increases. Among key global risks are those associated with the pandemic, inflationary pressures, and adjustments in monetary and financial conditions. In domestic financial markets, the peso depreciated, while medium- and long-term interest rates increased influenced by external conditions. Information up to October shows a recovery of economic activity, after the contraction observed during the third quarter. An environment of uncertainty continues and slack conditions are anticipated, with significant differences across sectors. Global and domestic inflationary pressures continue affecting annual headline and core inflation, which in November registered 7.37% and 5.67%, respectively. Headline and core inflation expectations for 2021, 2022, and for the next 12 months, increased again, as well as medium-term expectations, while those for longer terms have remained stable at levels above the target. Headline and core inflation forecasts were once again revised upwards, especially for 2022 (see table). Their annual variations are expected to decrease to a larger extent after one year, and converge to the 3% target by the end of the forecast horizon. These projections are subject to risks. On the upside: external inflationary pressures; cost-related pressures; core inflation persistence at high levels; exchange rate depreciation; and increases in agricultural and livestock product prices and in energy prices. On the downside: a widening of the negative output gap; social distancing measures; and exchange rate appreciation. The balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon deteriorated further and remains biased to the upside. The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the shocks that have affected inflation and the factors that determine it, along with the risk of price formation becoming contaminated, and the challenges posed by the ongoing tightening of monetary and financial global conditions. Based on these considerations, on this occasion, the Board decided to increase the target for the overnight interbank 1 interest rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%. With this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon For the next monetary policy decisions, the Board will monitor thoroughly the behavior of inflationary pressures as well as of all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations. The latter, in order to determine a policy rate that is consistent at all times with the trajectory needed to facilitate the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets. Voting in favor of the decision were Alejandro DÃ­az de LeÃ³n. Galia Borja. Irene Espinosa, and Jonathan Heath. Voting in favor of increasing the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.25% was Gerardo Esquivel. 2/ Forecast starting November 2021.

Turkiye,2021-12-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 15 percent to 14 percent. The reintroduction of travel restrictions and lockdowns due to the new variants keeps the downside risks to global economic activity alive and raises the uncertainty. Recovery in global demand, high course of commodity prices, supply constraints in some sectors and rise in transportation costs have led to producer and consumer price increases internationally. While the effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored, central banks in advanced economies assess that the rise in inflation on the back of rising energy prices and imbalances between supply and demand may last longer than previously anticipated. Accordingly, while monetary policy communication of central banks in advanced economies varies with their diverse outlook for economic activity, labor market and inflation expectations, they continue their supportive monetary stances and asset purchase programs. National income data and leading indicators show that domestic economic activity remains strong, with the help of robust external demand. The spread of domestic vaccination throughout the society facilitates the recovery in services, tourism and related sectors, which have been adversely affected by the pandemic, and leads to a more balanced composition in economic activity. Current account balance is expected to post a surplus in 2022 due to the strengthening of the upward trend in exports. Strengthening of the improvement trend in current account balance is important for price stability objective, and in that respect, developments in commercial and consumer loans are closely monitored. Increase in inflation in November has been driven by developments in exchange rates and supply side factors such as the rise in global food and agricultural commodity prices, supply constraints, and demand developments. The Committee decided to complete the use of the limited room implied by transitory effects of supply-side factors and other factors beyond monetary policy's control on price increases and reduced the policy rate by 100 basis points. Cumulative impact of the recent policy decisions will be monitored in the first quarter of 2022 and during this period, all aspects of the policy framework will be reassessed in order to create a foundation for a sustainable price stability. The CBRT will continue to use decisively all available instruments until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Colombia,2021-12-17,"The board voted 4-3 to raise the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 3.0%. The board voted 4-3 to raise the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 3.0%; three board members voted for a 75-basis point increase. The decision was based on the following considerations. Annual inflation in November exceeded expectations, rising 68 basis points from October to 5.26%. Annual core inflation (CPI excluding food and regulated items) rose 52 basis points to 2.54%. These results led to a revision in the inflation forecast to 5.3% in 2021 and 3.7% in 2022. Leading indicators suggest that GDP continued on a significant growth trajectory in the fourth quarter, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. The technical staff reaffirmed its 2021 GDP growth projection at 9.8%. The current account deficit is expected to rise to 5.6% of GDP in 2021, largely explained by growth in domestic demand. The deficit would decrease to 4.9% of GDP in 2022 amid tighter international financial conditions. Inflation expectations rose above the 3% target, even in the medium term, implying a risk of indexation processes at higher inflation rates. The BDBR reiterated its commitment to ensuring that inflation converges to the 3% annual target. Fecha de publicacion."
Russia,2021-12-17,"On 17 December 2021, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to increase the key rate by 100 b.p. to 8.50% per annum. Inflation is developing above the Bank of Russia's October forecast. The contribution of persistent factors to inflation remains considerable on the back of faster growth in demand relative to output expansion capacity. In this environment, given rising inflation expectations, the balance of risks for inflation is markedly tilted to the upside. This may bring about a more substantial and prolonged upward deviation of inflation from the target. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy stance is aimed to limit this risk and return inflation to 4%. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate increase at its upcoming meetings. Key rate decisions will take into account actual and expected inflation movements relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Based on the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will edge down to 4.04.5% by late 2022 and will remain close to 4% further on. Inflation dynamics. Inflation is developing above the Bank of Russia's October forecast. In October and November, seasonally adjusted growth in consumer prices rallied to a six-year high. Annual inflation went up to 8.4% (from 7.4% in September). It is estimated at 8.1% as of 13 December. Indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements still appreciably exceed 4% (annualised). Bank of Russia estimates show. This reflects the fact that steady growth in domestic demand exceeds production expansion capacity in a wide range of sectors. In these conditions, businesses find it easier to pass higher costs, including on the back of rising global prices, on to consumers. The impact of one-off supply-side drivers of inflation is translating into growing prices for a wider range of goods and services as inflation expectations of households and businesses remain high and unanchored. Households' inflation expectations went up again in December to a fresh five-year high. Recent data also indicate that businesses' price expectations are holding close to multi-year highs. Analyst expectations for 2022 have increased slightly, but are anchored close to 4% for the medium term. The dominating influence of inflationary factors could lead to a more substantial and prolonged deviation of inflation upwards from the target. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy stance is aimed to limit this risk and return annual inflation to 4%. Under the baseline scenario, annual inflation will edge down to 4.04.5% by the end of 2022 and will remain close to 4% further on. Monetary conditions, although tightened since the previous Board meeting, are still estimated as neutral. Rising nominal interest rates in the context of elevated inflation expectations have so far made a limited impact on lending and the propensity to save. Yields of short-term OFZs are up, reflecting market expectations for the key rate path. Yields on medium- and long-term OFZs have also increased, including due to heightened geopolitical tensions. Lending and deposit rates sustain their growth driven by the key rate rises between March and October. Funds are gradually flowing into fixed-term ruble deposits. Disbursements of corporate and retail loans are still high. The Bank of Russia's monetary policy stance will help solidify a trend towards the growing appeal of household deposits, protect the purchasing power of savings and ensure balanced expansion in lending. Economic activity is growing across a wide range of industries. However, supply-side constraints remain strong in a number of sectors. Their restraining effect on business activity may strengthen in the context of the spread of new coronavirus strains and the associated tightening of anti-pandemic measures. The rapidly expanding lending, growth in real wages and households' low propensity to save, driven by high inflation expectations, all support rising consumer activity, especially in non-food markets. Consumption of commercial services has approached its pre-pandemic level, despite the challenging epidemiological situation. Growing domestic and external demand and high corporate profits are shoring up investment activity. Inflationary pressure from the labour market has intensified. Demand for the labour force is growing in many industries. At the same time, many sectors show labour shortages, despite the inflow of foreign labour. The unemployment rate has dropped to a record low, while the number of vacancies is at a record high. The state of the labour market suggests that a further increase in steady growth rates of the Russian economy will be conditional primarily on the growth paces of labour productivity. Based on current trends in the Russian and global economy. GDP is projected to grow 4.5% in 2021. Inflation risks. The balance of risks is markedly tilted to the upside. The effect of proinflationary factors may be strengthened by elevated inflation expectations and accompanying secondary effects. Inflation slowdown may be hampered by remaining disruptions in production and logistics chains, labour shortages, as well as structural changes in the labour market caused by the pandemic. An increase in structural labour shortages may cause labour productivity growth to lag behind wage growth. Inflation risks posed by price trends in global commodity markets also remain relevant. Further changes in food prices will largely depend on the harvest volume, quality and preservation both in Russia and abroad. Short-term inflation risks are also associated with intensified volatility in global markets caused by, among other factors, a range of geopolitical events, which may affect exchange rate and inflation expectations. Given further intensification of inflationary pressure in the world economy, the central banks of advanced economies are forced to implement a faster normalisation of monetary policy. This may become an additional driver of higher volatility in global financial markets. Disinflationary risks for the baseline scenario remain moderate, largely linked to the pace and extent at which supply is adjusting to growing demand. The reopening of borders as restrictions are lifted may lead to a recovery in the consumption of foreign services and also alleviate the problem of labour shortages owing to an additional inflow of foreign labour. A faster â relative to the baseline scenario â normalisation of production and logistics chains in the Russian and global economies may become another source of downward pressure on prices. Medium-term inflation is largely influenced by fiscal policy. In its baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia proceeds from the fiscal policy normalisation path stipulated by the Guidelines for Fiscal. Tax and Customs and Tariff Policy, which assumes a return to fiscal rule parameters in 2022. In its forecast, the Bank of Russia also factors in decisions made by the Government of the Russian Federation to invest the liquid part of the National Wealth Fund. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate increase at its upcoming meetings. Key rate decisions will take into account actual and expected inflation movements relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 11 February 2022. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the medium-term forecast are to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Czech Republic,2021-12-22,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank increased the two-week repo rate to 3.75%, i.e. by one percentage point. At the same time, it increased the discount rate and the Lombard rate by the same amount to 2.75% and 4.75% respectively. Five members voted in favour of this decision and two members voted for leaving rates unchanged.. This decision of the Bank Board is underpinned by the autumn macroeconomic forecast and by an assessment of information obtained since it was prepared. Consistent with the autumn forecast is a sharp rise in market interest rates at the end of this year and the start of 2022 in response to the exceptionally strong price pressures from the domestic and foreign economies. Only a part of the forecasted rise in interest rates was delivered by the Bank Board's November decision. At its meeting today, moreover, the Bank Board assessed the risks and uncertainties of the autumn forecast as being markedly inflationary overall and hence requiring faster monetary policy tightening compared with the current forecast. The outlook for foreign industrial producer price inflation this year and the next has been revised markedly upwards. This is due mainly to a sharp rise in prices of energy commodities, i.e. natural gas, coal and electricity, coupled with persisting disruptions to material and component supplies. However, the outlook for higher growth in foreign producer prices is also driven by strong demand. For similar reasons, consumer price inflation in the euro area has been revised slightly upwards as well. Higher expected economic growth in the euro area this year and the next mainly reflects a stronger summer recovery of economies following their reopening. The outlook for industry at the close of this year has also improved. The foreign interest rate projection is almost unchanged. The Brent crude oil price has corrected the rise it recorded in late October. Overall, its outlook has changed only slightly by comparison with the assumptions of the current forecast, having decreased somewhat for next year. The expected euro-dollar exchange rate is marginally weaker over the entire forecast horizon. Domestic inflation has risen further so far in Q4, reaching 6% in November 2021. It is thus well above the upper boundary of the tolerance band around the Czech National Bank's 2% target. In November, annual consumer price inflation was about one percentage point above the forecast. This deviation was due mainly to sharply accelerating core inflation. However, faster growth in administered prices and higher fuel prices also acted in the same direction. Food price inflation went up as well, though more slowly than forecasted. The higher overall domestic consumer price inflation reflected faster growth in foreign industrial producer prices coupled with the exchange rate of the koruna, which was weaker than forecasted. Higher growth in housing-related energy prices and in the cost of owner-occupied housing for Czech households also played a role. The inflation developments up to now suggest unexpectedly strong inflation pressures from the domestic and foreign economies. According to the autumn forecast, headline inflation will rise further from its current high levels in the winter months and will be well above the upper boundary of the tolerance band around the inflation target in the next few quarters. However, inflation will start to ease in the course of next year and will decrease close to the 2% target over the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in late 2022 and early 2023, aided by a continued significant tightening of the monetary conditions. The Czech economy continued to grow in Q3. The recovery was stronger by comparison with the current forecast. This was due mainly to household consumption, which was supported by higher-than-forecasted wage growth. Spending of savings seems to have been stronger as well. Growth in government consumption was also above the forecast. As expected, the economic recovery was also fostered by gross capital formation. However, its double-digit growth primarily reflected an accelerating contribution of change in inventories. By contrast. GDP growth was dampened by a drop in net exports due to worse export performance of the Czech economy, which reflected forced cutbacks in industrial production owing to problems in global production and supply chains. According to the current forecast, the Czech economy will grow by around 2% overall this year and gain pace considerably over the next two years. Economic activity will return to the pre-pandemic level at the end of 2022. At the beginning of the autumn, industry was still being hampered by bottlenecks in global supply chains. In particular, the automotive industry and related sectors were suffering from shortages of material. Industrial production thus recorded a year-on-year decline in September and October. By contrast, retail sales excluding the automotive segment rose at a solid pace in October, signalling a continued recovery in household consumption in 2021 Q4. Growth in construction output increased further in October. The tightness in the labour market is increasing rather more markedly than expected by the autumn forecast. Employment started rising in Q3. The share of unemployed persons has been falling in line with the forecast in recent months, but the decline in the general unemployment rate has been slightly faster than forecasted. Many firms are facing labour shortages. Year-on-year wage growth in the market sector slowed sharply in Q3 due to base effects but was clearly above the forecast. The koruna-euro exchange rate has been weaker than forecasted so far during Q4. After the Czech National Bank increased interest rates in November, the koruna appreciated to CZK 25.20 to the euro. However, it then weakened temporarily due to negative financial market sentiment resulting from a deterioration in the epidemic situation and the emergence of the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus. A sizeable widening of the positive interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area probably dampened the impact of the negative sentiment on the exchange rate. According to the current forecast, the Czech currency will firm gradually to CZK 24 to the euro over the next year. To sum up the materialisation of the autumn forecast, economic growth and average wage growth were roughly one percentage point above expectations in Q3, as was inflation in November. The share of unemployed persons was as forecasted in the autumn months. At the same time, we can already state now that our next (winter) forecast will contain a sizeable increase in the inflation outlook, especially in the short run. The Bank Board assessed the risks and uncertainties of the autumn forecast as being markedly inflationary overall and hence requiring faster monetary policy tightening compared with the current forecast. In particular, the threat of weaker anchoring of inflation expectations in an environment of a long-running marked overshooting of the Czech National Bank's 2% target poses a substantial risk. Possible faster and longer-lasting growth in industrial producer prices abroad is a risk in the same direction. A potential weakening of the response of the exchange rate of the koruna to growth in domestic interest rates is another inflationary risk."
Thailand,2021-12-22,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 8/2021 Mr. Piti Disyatat. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 22 December 2021 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent. The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would continue to recover. Headline inflation increased temporarily mainly due to energy prices, but there remained a need to monitor developments of global inflation and cost pass-through. Meanwhile the spread of the Omicron variant would be a key risk to the economic outlook and therefore warranted close monitoring. The Committee viewed that the continued accommodative monetary policy would help support overall economic growth, and thus voted to maintain the policy rate. In addition, the ongoing financial and fiscal measures, with the focus on rebuilding and enhancing potential growth, would play an important part in bolstering the robust recovery of income. The Committee expected that the Thai economy would grow 09 percent in 2021 and would continue to expand 34 and 47 percent in 2022 and 2023, respectively, driven by domestic spending and a gradual improvement in foreign tourist figures. Meanwhile the recovery in various business sectors was expected to improve in line with economic activities. The Committee assessed that the Omicron outbreak would affect the economy in early 2022. The impact could be more severe and prolonged than expected due to downside risks such as the severity of the outbreak and the strictness of corresponding containment measures. However there remained a need to monitor the labor market recovery, especially with regard to employment and income which were still below pre-pandemic levels. Inflation was expected to remain within the target in the medium term, with headline inflation projection at 12, 17, and 14 percent in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. Headline inflation increased temporarily due to supply-side factors, particularly energy prices, which were expected to subside in the second half of 2022. The likelihood of second-round effects remained low due to limited cost pass-through given the slow economic recovery as well as weak employment and labor income. Nevertheless the Committee assessed that headline inflation would be subject to upside risks given higher global inflation and thus warranted close monitoring. Overall liquidity remained ample, but credit risks continued to pose a challenge to liquidity distribution, particularly to SMEs. Government bond yields were mostly unchanged. On exchange rates, the volatility of the baht relative to the US dollar remained high due to uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 situation which could escalate as well as monetary policy in advanced economies amid high inflationary pressures. The Committee would closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets, and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange 2 ecosystem, particularly through supporting SMEs in hedging against risks from exchange rate volatility. The Committee viewed that the government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery. Public health measures should strike a balance between containing the outbreak and supporting the recovery of economic activities. Fiscal measures should support the economic recovery in a targeted manner, with a focus on generating income and expediting measures to rebuild and enhance potential growth. Monetary policy should contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions overall. Financial and credit measures should be expedited to distribute liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner and help reduce debt burden. These measures included the special loan facility, asset warehousing scheme, and other measures by specialized financial institutions (SFIs). In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt consolidation and debt restructuring in a sustainable manner through the scheme launched on September 3, 2021 to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers' long-term debt serviceability. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery. In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook, namely mutations of COVID-19 virus, adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures, and higher cost pass-through. The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary."
