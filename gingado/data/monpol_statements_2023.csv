Israel,2023-01-02,"The Monetary Committee decides on January 2, 2023 to increase the interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 3.75 percent. Inflation in Israel is 5.3 percent over the past 12 months, and is high in a wide range of CPI components. However, there has been some moderation in some components. Inflation expectations for all ranges are within the target range. Economic activity in Israel remains strong, but the growth rate appears to have slowed relative to the first half of 2022. The labor market remains tight, although in recent months there has been some moderation in employment data. The Research Department has revised its macroeconomic staff forecast. In its assessment. GDP is expected to grow by 2.8 percent in 2023, and by 3.5 percent in 2024. The level of economic activity derived from the strong, particularly by international comparison. Home prices increased in the past 12 months by a significantly high rate. However, the numbers of building starts and permits remain higher than in the past, the number of home purchases continues to decline, and the volume of new mortgages taken out is close to its average precrisis level. Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel weakened by 1.6 percent against the US dollar, by 5.8 percent against the euro, and by 3.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The slowdown in economic activity abroad continued, and the risk of a recession is increasing in many countries. The inflation environment remainshigh, but in the US, the trend of moderation of inflation continues, and there are initial signs of moderation in inflation in the eurozone and in Britain. The Israeli economy is recording strong economic activity, accompanied by a tight labor market and an increase in the inflation environment. The Committee has therefore decided to continue the process of increasing the interest rate. The pace of raising the interest rate will be determined in accordance with activity data and the development of inflation, in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy goals. Economic activity in Israel remains strong, and the labor market remains tight and in a full employment environment, although the most recent data indicate some moderation. Inflation is above the target range, and encompasses a wide range of CPI components. However, there has been some moderation in some of the CPI components, mainly the tradable components. Monetary policy tightening and moderation of activity abroad are expected to lead to some slowdown in economic activity in Israel as well. Since the previous policy decision, the CPI increased by 0.1 percent in November. Inflation in the past 12 months is above the upper bound of the target range, at 5.3 percent (Figure 1). With that, inflation in Israel remains lower than in most of the advanced economies (Figure 34). Net of energy and fruits and vegetables, inflation is 5.3 percent, and with the further neutralization of the effects of taxation and regulation, it is 5.1 percent (Figure 2). The pace of inflation of the nontradable components is 5.3 percent: partly in view of the increase in the housing services component. The annual pace of inflation of the tradable components is also 5.3 percent, after declining slightly relative to the previous month (Figure 3). In recent months, there have been signs of a slowdown in the dynamic of the increase in inflation (Figure 4). For instance, the continuing downward trend in the price of oil, in viewof the decline in global demand, and the easing of the supply chain difficulties are expected to continue working to lower the prices of tradable goods, but with some lag and depending on developments in the exchange rate. One-year inflation expectations and forecasts from all sources are within the target range (Figure 6). Expectations derived from the capital market for the second year and onward are also within the target range (Figure 7). In the Committee's assessment, these trends and the process of monetary tightening in Israel and abroad, as well as the moderation of demand, are working to moderate inflation. However, the extent of fiscal expansion and the development of wages will have an impact on the pace of inflation's convergence to the target range. Economic activity is strong, although the pace of growth seems to have slowed relative to the first half of 2022. The aggregate balance of the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey for declined in November, but continues to reflect businesses' positive assessments of their situation (Figure 18). Credit card purchase data are in line with the long-term trends (Figure 20). Companies in the manufacturing and construction industries continue to report an easing of the equipment and raw materials constraint, in view of the moderation of pressure in the global supply chains, which is partly due to a decline in global demand. However,the equipment and raw materials constraint, mainly in the manufacturing industry, remains higher than it was prior to the COVID-19 crisis (Figure 24). Despite the decline in global demand, companies in Israel reported a slight increase in the intensity of the lack of export orders constraint on their activity. Goods exports (in nominal terms, excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds) declined by 11 percent in November compared with the previous month, but remain higher than before the pandemic, and services exports are very strong even though the most recent figure for Octoberwas slightly low (Figure 21). Goods imports are also high in all components (Figure 22). Credit card purchase data are in line with the long-term trends (Figure 20. The labor market remains tight, but in recent months there has been a slight moderation in employment data. The employment rate among those aged 15 and over (60.6 percent) declined slightly, andis slightly lower than its precrisis level. The employment rate among the prime working ages (25-64) remains high (78.2 percent), but the most recent data show some decline (Figure 25). The unemployment rate for those aged 15+ (3.9 percent) and among the prime working ages (3.5 percent) have been in an upward trend since June 2022 (Figure 26). In parallel, the demand for workers remains high. The number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate declined in November, but remain historically high (Figure 27). According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, the decline in businesses' expectations of expanding their employee numbers continued in November,but there is a high level of variance between industries (Figure 19). The annual pace of increase in nominal wages remains high, influenced by increases in the business sector, mainly in the high-tech industries, alongside wage stability in the public sector. Wages in the high-tech industries are higher than expected based on the precrisis trend, but in the past three months they have not continued to increase. According to Central Bureau of Statistics flash surveys for October, real wages are slightly lower than their long-term trend (Figure 28). The Bank of Israel Research Department revised its macroeconomic forecast.[1] In its assessment. GDP will grow by 2.8 percent in 2023 and 3.5 percent in 2024 (Figure 17). The level of economic activity derived from the forecast remains strong, particularly by international comparison. The unemployment rate among the prime working ages (25-64) is expected to average 4 percent in both 2023 and 2024. The average inflation rate in the fourth quarter of 2023 is expected to be 3 percent 2023, and is expected to decline to 2 percent in 2024. In addition, the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be 62 percent in 2023 and 61 percent in 2024. Home prices increased by 20.3 percent in thepast 12 months (Figure 12), a significantly higher pace than in previous years. Building starts and permits remain higher than in the past. The number of housing transactions continues to decline, and the volume of new mortgages taken out is close to its average precrisis level (Figure 13). Rents increased by 0.5 percent in November. The annual pace of increase in the housing component of the Consumer Price Index continued to rise, to 6.4 percent in November. In the domestic capital market there were declines in the equity indices, and yields on long-term government bonds increased significantly (Figure 9). Since the beginning of the monetary tightening process, there has been some slowdown in credit,mainly to small and medium businesses, alongside an increase in the interest rates on credit. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, the financing constraints reported by small and medium businesses have increased in recent months, but the financing constraint remains low (Figure 16). At this stage, there are no indications of a significant increase in credit risk or in businesses' difficulties in servicing their debts. Since the previous monetary policy decision,the shekel weakened by 1.6 percent against the US dollar, by 5.8 percent against the euro, and by 3.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate (Figure 8). The slowdown in global economic activity continues, and the risk of a recession is increasing in many countries. This is in view of the continuing conflict in Ukraine and the energy crisisin Europe, high inflation and monetary tightening, and the slowdown in China due to the increase in COVID-19 morbidity. In contrast, growth figures recorded thus far for 2022 were higher than expected, and the easing of the supply chain difficulties continues, with a decline in shipping costs. Investment houses revised their global 2023 and 2024 growth forecasts forthe various blocs downward (Figure 29). The global purchasing managers' indices of both advanced economies and emerging markets indicate a further slowdown in the pace of economic activity (Figure 30). The volume of world trade declined in October. There were price declines in the main global equity indices (Figure 38), mainly following the interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Government bond yields increased, particularly in Europe and Japan. Oil prices declined, and there was a sharp decline in natural gas prices in Europe. The global inflation environment remains high. However, in some countries, particularly the US, there is a perceptible downward trend. There are also initial indications of moderation in inflation in the eurozone and in Britain. In contrast, core inflation remains stable. In most countries, the inflation indices are significantly higherthan the central bank targets (Figure 33), and monetary tightening around the world continues. However, the leading central banks are slowing their pace of interest rate increases. In the US, the increase in the CPI declined to 7.1 percent in November, lower than previous forecasts. The Federal Reserve slowed the pace of increase in the federal funds rate, raising the rate by 50 basis points at its last meeting, and noted that it is preferable to move to a more moderate pace of increases in order to bring about a better balance of risks. However, the Fed increased its assessment regarding the interest rate at the end of 2023, and the median assessment is for a rate of 5.1 percent. In the eurozone, inflation moderated to 10.1 percent in November, lower than the previous forecast. The ECB also slowed its pace of interest rate increases, raising the rate by 50 basis points. In addition, the ECB announced a reduction of its balance sheet, and expectation of continued monetary tightening. In response, there was an increase in the interest rate expectation for Europe priced in by the market for 2023. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on January 16. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. February 20, 2023. [1] The full forecast is being published separately, and can be found at {link}. It includes more details on a number of significant sources of uncertainty indicated by the Research Department."
Poland,2023-01-04,"Warsaw, 4 January 2023 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 4 January 2023 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ▪ reference rate at 6.75%; ▪ lombard rate at 7.25%; ▪ deposit rate at 6.25%; ▪ rediscount rate at 6.80%; ▪ discount rate at 6.85%. Incoming information indicate that growth of economic activity in the global economy in 2022 Q4 slowed down. Activity in the global economy and its prospects continue to be negatively affected by the impact of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine, high energy prices, as well as by the tightening of monetary policy around the world. Meanwhile, there persists uncertainty regarding further impact of these shocks on economic conditions, including in particular in the European economy. In the euro area  after a decline in GDP growth in 2022 Q3  business condition indicators signal further weakening of activity in Q4. The effects of epidemic situation in China constitute additional uncertainty factor. Inflation in many economies  despite some fall in recent months  remains at a high level, which is mainly driven by high energy prices, protracted effects of the earlier supply shocks, including shocks at commodity markets, as well as demand factors and increasing labour costs. Under such conditions, core inflation in most countries likewise remains high. However, following a deterioration of global economic conditions in recent months, prices of some commodities have declined. At the same time, supply chain disruptions are visibly mitigated compared to the first half of 2022. As a result, price pressures are diminishing, which translates into lower growth in producer prices in many countries. The Federal Reserve of the United States and the European Central Bank raised again their interest rates in December 2022. In turn, central banks in the Central-Eastern Europe region  after earlier significant interest rate increases  have kept interest rates unchanged. 1/3 In Poland, incoming data indicate a slowdown in economic growth. According to Statistics Poland data. GDP growth in 2022 Q3 slowed down to 3.6% y/y. Monthly data for October and November suggest a further decline in GDP growth in Q4, whereas the economic outlook is subject to significant uncertainty. Despite the decelerating GDP growth, labour market situation remains good, which is reflected i.a. in a low unemployment rate. At the same time, however. LFS data for 2022 Q3 indicate a fall in the Polish LFS total employment. Inflation in Poland in November 2022 decreased to 17.5% y/y. The decrease in CPI in year- on-year terms compared to October was driven by lower growth in prices of energy carriers and fuels. Inflation remains at a high level, which  to a great extent  stems from passing higher costs on to consumer prices. High commodity prices have been reflected in rising food and energy prices, and  together with persistent effects of the earlier disruptions in global value chains  increase operating costs of enterprises, which  given the still relatively strong demand  inclined firms to raise prices of goods, contributing to higher core inflation. In turn, the so-called Anti-inflationary Shield continued to limit CPI inflation. At the same time, in recent months, producer price growth declined which signals diminishing cost pressures on consumer prices. The Council assessed, that the expected weakening of the external economic conditions, together with monetary policy tightening by major central banks, will curb global inflation and commodity prices. The weakening of the global economic conditions will also hamper GDP growth in Poland. Under such circumstances, the hitherto significant monetary policy tightening by NBP will support a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target. At the same time, given strength and persistence of the current shocks that remain beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, in the short term inflation will remain high, and its return to the NBP inflation target will be gradual. A decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council's assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy. Further decisions of the Council will depend on incoming information regarding perspectives for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy. NBP will take all necessary actions in order to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability, including above all to reduce the risk of inflation remaining elevated. NBP may 2/3 intervene in the foreign exchange market, in particular to limit fluctuations of the zloty exchange rate that are inconsistent with the direction of monetary policy."
Armenia,2023-01-08,"PRESS RELEASE 01.08.2023 Refinancing Rate Set at 10.25% At the August 1, 2023 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 0.25 percentage points to 10.25%. In June 2023, the 12-month inflation continued to decrease at a rapid pace, reaching -0.5%. The 12-month core inflation also declined significantly, amounting to 1.5%. In the second quarter of 2023, the rates of economic growth in the world and main partner countries of Armenia remain slow, and the 12-month inflation continues to decrease. However, in all partner countries sticky price inflation remains high amid sustained inflationary pressures coming from labor markets. Consequently, the central banks of partner countries will carry on conducting a contractionary monetary policy. Influenced by tight financial conditions, prices in international commodity markets are falling further. As a result, the inflationary effects on the Armenian economy from the external sector continue weakening. A higher-than-expected economic activity was observable in Armenia in the second quarter of 2023, again driven by strong growth reported in the construction and services sectors. Sustained high external demand and increased income in the domestic economy amid a large influx of capital, labor and tourism contributed to expanding demand. The inflation environment in Armenia continues to mitigate rapidly as a result of the notably weakened inflationary impact from the external sector, the implemented contractionary monetary policy and the appreciation of the dram. However, price inflation of services and some goods is being adjusted more slowly in the light of high demand and inflation expectations. The Board of the Central Bank of Armenia finds it appropriate to reduce the policy rate. The Board will be consistent in taking action to handle demand and stabilize inflation expectations. As outlined in the monetary policy scenario, the 12-month inflation will remain below the target in the near term, then it will gradually increase and stabilize around the 4% target in the medium term. The Board of the Central Bank of Armenia estimates that the risks to inflation deviating from the projected path are mostly balanced; in the event these risks materialize in any direction, the Board stands ready to respond accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective. Detailed information underlying the setting of interest rate can be found in the Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by August 15, 2023."
Romania,2023-01-10,"In its meeting of 10 January 2023, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual inflation rate reached 16.76 percent in November 2022, i.e. above the forecast, after having fallen to 15.32 percent in October from 15.88 percent in September. The increase was driven, during this period too, especially by the hike in food prices, including VFE prices, but also by the stronger advance in the prices of non-food items and market services. Their impact was, however, markedly counterbalanced by the slower fuel price dynamics, amid the downward trend in oil prices, as well as the firewood price cap. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate posted a slightly faster upward movement in the first two months of 2022 Q4, contrary to forecasts, rising from 11.9 percent in September to 14.0 percent in November 2022, as a result of almost across-the-board price increases in the three core inflation segments. The evolution of adjusted CORE2 inflation continues to reflect the effects of large hikes in agri-food commodity prices and energy and transport costs, alongside the influences of bottlenecks in production chains. These were compounded, during this period too, by high short-term inflation expectations and the resilience of demand in certain segments, as well as by the significant share of food items and imported goods in the CPI basket. Annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP  inflation indicator for EU Member States) moved up to 14.6 percent in November from 13.4 percent in September. Furthermore, average annual CPI inflation rate and average HICP inflation rate went up to 13.1 percent and 11.4 percent respectively in November from 11.8 percent and 10.2 percent respectively in September 2022, remaining however below the levels prevailing in the region and the Baltic countries. Economic activity increased in 2022 Q3 by 1.3 percent compared to the previous three months, the same as in Q2, thus significantly exceeding the forecasts, which makes it likely for excess aggregate demand to pick up again over this period, contrary to expectations. By contrast, compared to the same year-earlier period. GDP growth continued to decelerate in 2022 Q3  to 4.0 percent from 5.1 percent in Q2  remaining, however, significant from a historical perspective. The economic growth was supported, this time round, mainly by gross fixed capital formation and only to a secondary extent by household consumption, while the contribution of net exports strongly re-entered negative territory, given that the annual growth rate of imports of goods and services exceeded notably that of exports thereof in terms of volume. Against this background, the growth rate of the trade deficit accelerated considerably versus the same year-earlier period, despite the narrowing of the unfavourable differential between the lower annual change in import prices and that in export prices, whereas the annual dynamics of the current account deficit doubled. The latest data and analyses point to a significant slowdown in economic growth in 2022 Q4 versus Q3, under the impact of the protracted war in Ukraine and the extension of the associated sanctions, implying nevertheless a robust GDP growth compared to the same period of 2021 amid a base effect. Relevant from this perspective is the acceleration seen in October by the annual growth of retail trade and motor vehicles and motorcycles sales, but especially by that of services to households. At the same time, the volume of construction works posted a markedly faster expansion in the first month of 2022 Q4, while industrial production continued to report a lower contraction in annual terms. However, exports recorded a considerable drop in their annual change, much more pronounced than that of imports of goods and services, inter alia in the context of the unfavourable evolution of external prices, which triggered an acceleration in the annual increase in trade and current account deficits. The number of employees in the economy saw further rises in September-October 2022, yet notably lower than in H1, while the ILO unemployment rate advanced very slightly in October-November, after its decrease to 5.4 percent in Q3. Furthermore, the hiring intentions for the near-term horizon declined again in December 2022, after a visible recovery in the previous two months, whereas the labour shortage reported by companies remained stuck in 2022 Q4 to the lower level reached in the previous period. The main interbank money market rates witnessed gradual downward adjustments November through December 2022, amid the easing of liquidity conditions, while yields on government securities declined more steeply, inter alia under the influence of the improvement in global financial market sentiment and in the risk perception towards financial markets in the region. The average lending rate on new business and the average remuneration of new time deposits in the case of households continued, however, to climb in October and November 2022. Against this background, reflecting also an increase in the relative attractiveness of investments in domestic currency, the leu posted an appreciation trend versus the euro during the last two months of 2022 as well. Moreover, the domestic currency strengthened significantly against the US dollar following the developments on international financial markets. The annual dynamics of credit to the private sector saw a sharper decrease in the first two months of 2022 Q4, reaching 13.2 percent in November (16.0 percent in September), amid the slower growth of the leu-denominated component, counterbalanced however slightly by the further uptrend in the high dynamics of foreign currency loans. As a result, the share of leu-denominated loans in credit to the private sector continued to fall slowly, to 69.4 percent in November from 70.6 percent in September. According to current assessments, the annual inflation rate will probably decline in 2023 Q1 in line with the latest medium-term forecast (November 2022), but will fall at a significantly faster pace afterwards, to reach one-digit levels in 2023 Q3 already. This is due to the extension of energy price capping and compensation schemes until 31 March 2025, concurrently with the changes made to these schemes starting 1 January 2023. In the near run, the main drivers behind the decrease in the annual inflation dynamics will however be the disinflationary base effects associated with the sizeable hikes recorded previously by energy and fuel prices, as well as the relatively steeper downtrend of oil prices in recent months. The balance of supply-side risks to the new inflation outlook is in relative equilibrium, given the recent developments in key energy and agri-food commodity prices, as well as those in their major determinants. The war in Ukraine and the related sanctions further generate, however, considerable uncertainties and risks to the outlook for economic activity, hence to medium-term inflation developments, through the possibly stronger effects exerted on consumer purchasing power and confidence, as well as on firms' activity, profits and investment plans, but also by potentially affecting more severely the European/global economy and the risk perception towards economies in the region, with an unfavourable impact on financing costs. Furthermore, the absorption of EU funds, especially those under the Next Generation EU programme, is conditional on fulfilling strict milestones and targets for implementing the projects. However, it is essential for carrying out the necessary structural reforms, energy transition included, as well as for counterbalancing, at least in part, the contractionary impact of supply-side shocks, compounded by the war in Ukraine and by the tightening of economic and financial conditions worldwide. Significant uncertainties and risks are, however, associated with the fiscal policy stance as well, given, on one hand, the public deficit target set for 2023 in order to continue budget consolidation amid the excessive deficit procedure and the hefty increase in financing cost and, on the other hand, the packages of support measures to be implemented or extended this year, in a still challenging economic and social environment domestically and globally, with potential adverse implications for budget parameters. Also relevant are the ECB's and the Fed's prospective monetary policy stances, as well as the behaviour of central banks in the region. In the meeting held today, 10 January 2023, based on the currently available data and assessments, as well as in light of the very elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 7.00 percent per annum from 6.75 percent per annum as of 11 January 2023. Moreover, it decided to raise the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 8.00 percent per annum from 7.75 percent per annum and the deposit facility rate to 6.00 percent per annum from 5.75 percent. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to keep the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to anchor inflation expectations over the medium term, as well as to foster saving through higher bank rates, so as to bring the annual inflation rate back in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat target on a lasting basis, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. At the current juncture, the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms inter alia by using EU funds to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand adverse developments. The NBR closely monitors developments in the domestic and international environment and will continue to use the tools at its disposal to achieve the fundamental objective of price stability in the medium term. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 23 January 2023 at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board will be held on 9 February 2023."
Peru,2023-01-12,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT JANUARY 2023 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE RATE TO 7.75% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to raise the reference interest rate by 25 bps to 7.75 percent, thus continuing to adjust its monetary policy stance. This decision takes into account the following developments: Year-on-year inflation increased from 8.45 percent in November to 8.46 percent in December, due to higher prices for locally produced food, while core inflation decreased from 5.71 percent in November to 5.59 percent in December, both above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The significant increase in international food and fuel prices since the second half of 2021, accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in global inflation in magnitudes not seen in many years and towards levels significantly higher than the inflation targets of central banks, both in advanced and other economies in the region. A downward trend in year-on-year inflation is forecast since March, with a return to the target range in the fourth quarter of this year, due to a moderation of the impact of international food and fuel prices, and to a reduction in inflation expectations. One-year-ahead expected inflation decreased from 4.68 percent in November to 4.30 percent in December, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most leading and expectations indicators for economic activity recovered in December, but remain in pessimistic territory. The outlook for global economic activity has deteriorated due to monetary tightening in advanced economies, the impact of inflation on consumption, and international conflicts. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants, including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, to consider changes in the monetary stance. The Board reaffirms its commitment to adopt the necessary actions to ensure the return of inflation to the target range over the forecast horizon. The Board also decided the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 5.25 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 8.25 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months and the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months. In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates based on the amount of the operations. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on February 9, 2023."
South Korea,2023-01-13,"The bank of korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 3.25% to 3.50%. The Board judges that the additional 25 basis points hike is warranted to ensure price stability, as inflation still remains high and is projected to be above the target level for a considerable time, although the domestic economic growth rate is expected to be below the November forecast. Currently available information suggests that the global economic slowdown has continued, affected by ongoing high inflation and the resultant policy rate hikes in major countries, although inflation is starting to slow due to the decline in global oil prices. In global financial markets, the US dollar has continued to weaken due to the adjustment to the pace of the US Federal Reserve's policy rate hikes and prospects of strengthening monetary tightening, such as at the European Central Bank. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the pace of global inflation slowdown, monetary policy changes in major countries and US dollar trends, developments in the Chinese economy after the easing of its COVID-19 restriction policies, and geopolitical risks. Domestic economic growth has continued to slow with exports decreasing significantly and the recovery in private consumption weakening. Labor market conditions have generally continued to be favorable, but the decline in the increase in the number of persons employed has continued due to the economic slowdown. Going forward, domestic economic growth is expected to weaken, affected by the global economic slowdown and the increase in interest rates, and GDP growth for this year will be below the November forecast of 1.7%. As for the economic outlook, uncertainties regarding the pace of recovery in the Chinese economy and an economic slowdown in major countries are both judged to be high. Consumer price inflation has remained high at 5.0% in December driven by accelerating price increases in processed food products, with the continuing effects of electricity and gas fee hikes, although increases in the price of petroleum products have moderated. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has fallen slightly to within the lower-4% range, and short-term inflation expectations of the general public have slowed to the upper-3% range, but they have continued to stay high. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain around 5% in January and February, but will gradually decrease due to the base effect and weakening pressures from the demand side. Consumer price inflation for this year is expected to be generally consistent with the November forecast of 3.6%. Uncertainty surrounding inflation forecasts is judged to be high, regarding the degree of economic slowdown at home and abroad, the size of the increases in electricity and gas fees and public utility fees, and movements of global oil prices and exchange rates. In financial and foreign exchange markets, unrest has been eased by market stabilization measures and adjustments to the pace of the US Federal Reserve's policy rate hikes. Long-term market interest rates have fallen, spreads on corporate bonds and commercial paper have narrowed, and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has decreased significantly. However, high credit risk aversion is continuing among non-prime bonds and project financing asset-backed commercial paper (PF-ABCP). Household loans have continued to decrease, and the decline in housing prices has widened significantly across all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over the medium-term horizon as it monitors economic growth, while paying attention to financial stability. The Board deems it warranted to maintain the restrictive policy stance with an emphasis on ensuring price stability, as inflation is expected to remain high above the target level, although the domestic economic growth rate has slowed. Meanwhile, the Board will judge whether the Base Rate needs to rise further while thoroughly assessing the economic downside risks and financial stability risks, the effects of the Base Rate raises, the pace of inflation slowdown, and monetary policy changes in major countries. Opening Remarks to the Press Conference. Today, the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) of the Bank of Korea decided to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 3.25% to 3.50%. I will first go over financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and then explain the background to today's Base Rate decision in detail. First, looking at the changes in external conditions since the November MPB meeting, the global economy has continued to slow, affected by ongoing high inflation and the resultant policy rate hikes in major countries, although inflation is starting to slow due to falling global oil prices. Specifically, the U.S, economy has seen slowing growth, mainly in consumption. The euro area now faces a higher chance of negative growth, due to sustained slumps in consumption and investment. In China, domestic demand and exports continue to stagnate amid the virus surge, despite an earlier-than-expected easing of its COVID restriction policies. As for global financial markets, major price variables have generally shown reduced volatility, with the U.S, dollar remaining weak, reflecting the U.S. Federal Reserve's adjustment of its policy rate hike pace at the December FOMC meeting. The Korean economy has continued to slow. Exports dropped sharply due to a slowdown in major trading partners' economies and in the IT business. Consumption has also shown weaker recovery momentum, as the boosted demand during the normalization of economic activities has gradually slowed along with interest rate hikes. With the domestic economy continuing its slowdown, the GDP growth for this year is expected to be below the November forecast of 1.7%. The economy is projected to improve gradually going into the second half of this year, driven by recoveries in the Chinese economy and in the IT business. However, there are still high uncertainties related to the pace of recovery in the Chinese economy as a result of the easing of COVID restriction policies and to the degree of the economic slowdown in major economies. Concerning inflation, consumer price inflation remained high, at 5.0% in December. The pace of the price increases of processed food accelerated, with the continuing effects of electricity and gas fee hikes while the rise in the prices of petroleum products slowed. Core inflation has declined slightly to 4.1% and short-term inflation expectations of the general public decreased to 3.8% in December, but they are still at a high level. Going forward, consumer price inflation is projected to be around 5% in January and February, as the accumulated cost pressure is reflected in public utility fees, including electricity and gas fees, and processed food prices, before gradually going down. The annual consumer price inflation for 2023 is expected to be generally in line with the November forecast of 3.6%. However, concerning the price forecasts, uncertainties remain high in terms of the degree of the economic slowdown at home and abroad, the size of the hikes in electricity and gas fees, and movements of global oil prices and the exchange rate. In the domestic financial and foreign exchange markets, the market unrest seems to have eased thanks to market stabilization measures by the government and the Bank of Korea, and adjustments to the pace of the US Federal Reserve's policy rate hikes. Long-term market interest rates have fallen, corporate bond and CP spreads have declined significantly, and the Korean won to U.S, dollar exchange rate has dropped to the mid-1,200 won range. However, there is still a high level of credit-risk aversion against non-prime bonds and PF-ABCP in the financial markets due to concerns over the sluggish real estate market. Exchange rates also remain highly uncertain, in line with the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions and movements of the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen. Looking at household debt and the housing market, housing prices in both the Seoul metropolitan area and other regions have declined significantly. Household loans have continued to decrease, led by unsecured loans, due to rising borrowing rates and the sluggishness in the housing market. The Board decided today to raise the Base Rate from 3.25% to 3.50%. The Board judged that today's 25 basis-point increase is warranted to achieve price stability, given that inflation, still remaining at a high level, is projected to run above the target level for a considerable time, although the GDP growth rate for this year is expected to be below the November forecast. Two members―Joo Sangyong and Shin Sung Hwan―voted against the decision to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, proposing to maintain the Base Rate at the current level of 3.25%. Looking ahead, the Board deems it warranted to maintain its restrictive policy stance with a focus on price stability going forward, as inflation this year is expected to run above the target level while gradually moderating after March."
Kazakhstan,2023-01-13,"Press Release The base rate remains unchanged at 16.75% January 13, 2023 Astana The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to set the base rate at 16.75% per annum with a corridor of +/- 1 p.p. The decision was made in the context of compliance of actual inflation with the forecasts of the National Bank. The dynamics of internal and external inflation processes, as well as the trajectory of economic growth are formed in accordance with the baseline scenario of the forecast of the National Bank. Monthly inflation gradually slows down, at the same time exceeding its average annual values. The balance of inflation risks remains biased in favor of pro-inflation risks with a high stable part of inflation and accelerated inflation expectations. The negative impact of supply chain restructuring on the economy continues. Remaining risks require keeping the base rate at current levels for an extended period of time. Inflation is formed in accordance with the expectations of the National Bank. Monthly inflation has been slowing for the third month in a row, falling to 1.2% in December 2022 (from 1.8% in September 2022). However, despite the decline, it is still high, significantly exceeding the annual average (the average December rate over the last 5 years was 0.7%). At the end of 2022, the annual inflation rate amounted to 20.3%, falling within the forecasted range of 20-21%. As part of the annual inflation rate, the highest growth continues to be demonstrated by the prices of food and non-food products. Inflation of paid services remained unchanged, with a decrease in the cost of rent for improved housing and suppressed growth in prices for regulated services. At the same time, the persistent part of inflation remains high, indicating the persistence of a pro-inflationary environment. Inflation expectations continue to show acceleration. In December, their value renewed the maximums since the survey, amounting to 21.3%. The growth of inflation expectations of the population is associated with changes in food prices, external events and changes in prices for fuels and lubricants. High and unstable inflation expectations may be a factor in a stronger growth of inflation and its slower decline in the future. External prices are generally formed according to the conditions of the baseline scenario. The external inflationary background is weakening, in line with the rhetoric of the previous decision. With widespread tightening of monetary conditions, the beginning of slowdown of inflation processes in many countries, including in the countries - trading partners is noted. Together with expected smooth decrease of world prices for food it will have downward effect on inflation in Kazakhstan. Oil prices are formed slightly lower than the level of $90 per barrel in the baseline scenario on average in 2023. The trajectory of economic growth is formed close to the upper limit of the estimates of the National Bank. According to a preliminary estimate of the Bureau of National Statistics of the Agency for Strategic Planning and Reforms of the Republic of Kazakhstan in January-December 2022, the GDP growth rate was 3.1%. Consumer imports growth, stable dynamics of retail turnover and a continued increase in consumer lending are observed. Inflationary risks persist. The restructuring of the trade structure with high and unstable inflation expectations, continued high food inflation, postponed inflation for regulated goods and services after the period of administrative regulation, and high uncertainty about the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine are key risks for inflation. At the same time, the situation with external demand amid risks of recession in the world, as well as logistical conditions introduce significant uncertainty about the trajectory of oil prices and economic growth. Given that the actual inflation rate is formed in accordance with the baseline scenario and taking into account the current balance of risks, the National Bank adheres to the previous statement about the proximity of the end of the base rate hike cycle. The potential for further increase in the base rate is limited. At the same time, given the remaining pro-inflationary risks and in order to avoid the anchoring of inflation expectations at high levels, it is necessary to maintain the base rate at current values for an extended period of time The next base rate decision will include an updated forecast from the February 2023 round. The next scheduled decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on February 24, 2023 at 12:00 p.m."
Malaysia,2023-01-19,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 2.75 percent. The global economy continues to be weighed down by elevated cost pressures, higher interest rates, and COVID-19-related disruptions in China. These factors more than offset the support from positive labour market conditions, and the full reopening of economies and international borders. Headline inflation moderated slightly from high levels in recent months. However, core inflation remains above historical averages. Central banks are expected to continue raising interest rates, albeit at a slower pace, to manage inflationary pressures. This will continue to pose headwinds to the global growth outlook. On the other hand, growth in China is expected to improve once the current COVID-19 wave subsides. The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, including an escalation of geopolitical tensions, weaker-than-expected growth outturns in major economies, and a sharp tightening in financial market conditions. For Malaysia, the latest data indicated continued economic expansion in the final quarter of last year on account of resilient domestic demand. As a result, growth for 2022 is expected to exceed the earlier projected range of 6.5% - 7.0%. Coming off a strong performance in 2022, growth in 2023 is expected to moderate amid a slower global economy. Growth will remain supported by domestic demand. Household spending will be underpinned by sustained improvements in employment and income prospects. Tourist arrivals have continued to rise, further lifting the tourism-related sectors. The realisation of multi-year infrastructure projects will support investment activity. Downside risks to the domestic economy continue to stem from a weaker-than-expected global growth, higher risk aversion in global financial markets amid more aggressive monetary policy tightening in major economies, further escalation of geopolitical conflicts, and re-emergence of significant supply chain disruptions. Headline inflation has averaged 3.4% for the period January-November 2022. As projected, headline inflation peaked in 3Q 2022, while underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, has averaged 2.9% up to November 2022. Over the course of 2023, headline and core inflation are expected to moderate but remain at elevated levels amid lingering demand and cost pressures. Existing price controls and fuel subsidies, and the remaining spare capacity in the economy, will continue to partly contain the extent of upward pressures to inflation. The balance of risk to the inflation outlook is tilted to the upside and remains highly subject to any changes to domestic policy on subsidies and price controls, as well as global commodity price developments. Today's decision allows the MPC to assess the impact of the cumulative past OPR adjustments, given the lag effects of monetary policy on the economy. At the current OPR level, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic growth. Further normalisation to the degree of monetary policy accommodation would be informed by the evolving conditions and their implications to the domestic inflation and growth outlook. The MPC will continue to calibrate the monetary policy settings that balance the risks to domestic inflation and sustainable growth. Bank Negara Malaysia 19 January 2023."
Turkiye,2023-01-19,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 9 percent. Although recently released data point to a stronger economic activity than anticipated, recession concerns in developed economies as a result of ongoing geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes continue. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the high level in producer and consumer inflation continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue to increase due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. Additionally, financial markets started to adjust their expectations that the central banks would end the rate hike cycles in the near term on the back of the increasing recession risks. A strong growth was observed in the first three quarters of 2022. Indicators for the last quarter of the year show that a slowdown in growth due to the weakening foreign demand is compensated by the relatively strong course in domestic demand. The effects of foreign demand-based pressures observed in the manufacturing industry on domestic demand and supply capacity currently remain limited. Compared to peer economies, job creation has been stronger. Considering the sectors that contribute to the employment increase, it is observed that the growth dynamics are supported by structural gains. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues throughout the year. On the other hand, domestic consumption demand, high level of energy prices and the likelihood of a recession in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. As announced in the 2023 Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy document, the Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and the entire policy toolset, particularly funding channels, will be aligned with liraization targets. Level and underlying trend of inflation have been improved with the support of the integrated policy approach implemented to strengthen sustainable price stability and financial stability. The effects of slowing foreign demand on aggregate demand conditions and production are closely monitored. It is critically important that financial conditions remain supportive for the sustainability of structural gains in supply and investment capacity by preserving the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment in a period of increasing uncertainties regarding global growth as well as further escalation of geopolitical risks. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The CBRT will implement Liraization Strategy in order to create an institutional basis for permanent and sustainable price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Pakistan,2023-01-23,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement January 23, 2023. At today's meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to increase the policy rate by 100 basis points to 17 percent. The committee noted that inflationary pressures are persisting and continue to be broad-based. If these remain unchecked, they could feed into higher inflation expectations over longer- than-anticipated period. The MPC stressed that it is critical to anchor inflation expectations and achieve the objective of price stability to support sustainable growth in the future. Since the last meeting, the MPC particularly noted three important economic developments. First despite some moderation in November and December, inflation continues to remain elevated. Importantly core inflation has been on rising trend for the past 10 months. Moreover the recent pulse surveys show inching- up of consumers and business inflation expectations. Second near-term challenges for the external sector have increased despite the policy-induced contraction in the current account deficit. The lack of fresh financial inflows and ongoing debt repayments have led to continuous drawdown in official reserves. Third the global economic and financial conditions broadly remain uncertain in the near-to-short term, leading to mixed implications for the domestic economy. The expected slowdown in global demand could negatively impact the outlook of exports and workers' remittances for emerging economies, including Pakistan. This would partly offset the gains from the import contraction. On the flip side, some moderation in the international commodity prices may help reduce inflation, and the improvement in global financial conditions may also provide some relief on the external sector. On balance, the committee reiterated its November 2022 assessment that the short-term costs of bringing down inflation are lower than the long-term costs of allowing it to become entrenched. The MPC also emphasized on the engagements with the multilateral and bilateral partners to overcome domestic uncertainty and to address the near-term external sector challenges. Real sector. The incoming high-frequency data continues to suggest broad-based and sustained moderation in economic activity in response to policy tightening and exogenous shocks, like the 2022 floods. Sale volumes of automobiles. POL, and cement declined significantly in December on y/y and m/m basis. On the production side, the large-scale manufacturing (LSM) output declined by. percent in November 2022. Going forward, production cuts by firms and supply constrains could pull LSM growth further down. Moreover the latest data on cotton arrivals point to lower crop production than anticipated earlier. This could potentially weaken the agriculture sector outlook despite satisfactory reports about sugarcane production and progress on sowing of wheat crop for the current season. Taking stock of these developments, the MPC views that the downside risks to the SBP's baseline growth outlook for this year have increased. External sector. The current account deficit narrowed by around 60 percent to $3. billion in H1-FY23. This substantial reduction was due to sharp contraction in imports, reflecting the impact of policy tightening and administrative measures. The contraction in imports was broad-based, with all major groups, except food and petroleum groups, recording declines. Petroleum imports increased by 17. percent (BOP data), resulting in Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN their share (in total imports) rising to 34. percent in H1-FY23 from 23. percent in H1-FY22. In this backdrop, the MPC noted that effective implementation of energy conservation measures and appropriate pricing of petroleum products is critical for much-needed reduction in energy imports. The benefit of an 18. percent fall in imports was partially offset by declines in export receipts and remittances. Notwithstanding the reduction in the current account deficit, the external sector remains under stress due to delay in realization of official financial inflows, debt repayments and ongoing political uncertainty. In this regard, the MPC views that the completion of the pending 9th review under the IMF's EFF is critical for reducing uncertainty and unlocking multilateral and bilateral inflows. Fiscal sector. The fiscal deficit widened to. percent of GDP in the first four months of FY23 from. percent in the same period last year, while the primary surplus fell to. percent of GDP, as compared to. percent last year. The FBR taxes grew by 17. percent in H1-FY23, slower than the growth envisaged in the budget. The expectation of further slowdown in economic activity and reduction in imports in H2-FY23 poses downside risks to maintaining growth momentum in tax collection. The MPC noted that the current fiscal stance is inconsistent with monetary tightening. Thus given the evolving macroeconomic challenges, it is important for the fiscal policy to achieve the planned consolidation in order to help contain inflation and pave the way for sustainable growth. Monetary and inflation outlook. The broad money growth decelerated in H1-FY23, primarily reflecting the stress on the external account. Domestic credit, on the other hand, expanded owing to seasonal rise in private sector credit along with increased budgetary borrowing because of reduced external financing. The disaggregated analysis of private sector credit shows retirement in consumer finance and moderation in working capital and fixed investment loans. National CPI inflation remained at elevated levels despite some moderation in recent months. Compared to 26. percent y/y in October, the headline inflation slightly eased to 23. percent in November and 24. percent in December 2022. Increase in food inflation remains the major contributor to this persistence in inflation. The core inflation also rose due to increasing core goods prices, especially durables. Downward adjustment in fuel prices and reduction in fuel cost charges slightly muted the energy inflation in recent months. However the uncertainty on their future path and expected near-term adjustments remain the major upside risks to the inflation outlook. Reflecting these concerns, both the consumer and business inflation expectations have drifted upwards over the short and medium term in latest pulse surveys. The MPC views that anchoring of inflation expectations is important to achieve the medium term inflation target of percent by December 2024 and requires coordinated monetary and fiscal policy efforts.

Hungary,2023-01-24,"At its meeting on 24 January 2023, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 25 January 2023:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. Over the recent period, global economic growth has slowed and GDP has already declined in several countries. Looking ahead, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war, the energy crisis in Europe and the generally rising interest rate environment continue to present significant uncertainty. Commodity and energy prices have fallen significantly in the past months but remain high relative to previous years. Inflation has started to moderate slowly in an increasing number of countries. Weakening demand, falling energy and commodity prices, as well as lower international freight costs and the easing of difficulties in production chains, point to a continued fall in global inflation from 2023. Investor sentiment has improved slightly since the last interest rate decision. Risk appetite has been mainly influenced by macroeconomic data releases, the economic outlook and expectations related to the monetary policy of the world's leading central banks. Developments in the Russia-Ukraine war continue to create significant uncertainties. According to both market pricing and decision makers' communications, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are expected to raise interest rates further. In addition, based on its earlier announcement, the ECB would start reducing the portfolio built under its asset purchase programme from March 2023. In the CEE region, the Romanian central bank raised its policy rate by 25 basis points. By contrast, the Czech and the Polish central banks left interest rates unchanged. High frequency data suggest a further slowdown in GDP growth by the end of 2022. In November, the volume of retail sales excluding fuel sales declined. The outlook for production activity improved in the past month; however, confidence indicators remained at low levels. The labour market continues to be tight, and the unemployment rate is low. The pace of growth this year is likely to be slowed by both domestic and external demand factors. The decline in real incomes, rising corporate costs, delayed public investment and the stricter interest rate environment all have a restraining impact on domestic demand. Despite subdued global economic activity. Hungary's foreign market share is expected to increase due to growing domestic export capacities, which is also supported by the dynamic expansion of battery production. According to the December Inflation Report projection. Hungary's GDP increased by 4.55.0 percent in 2022 before rising 0.51.5 percent this year, by 3.54.5 percent in 2024 and by 3.04.0 percent in 2025. In December 2022, annual inflation was 24.5 percent and core inflation stood at 24.8 percent. The increase in inflation was entirely accounted for by a pick-up in fuel prices. The incoming data fell short of expectations, which was attributable in part to subdued energy consumption due to the weather, in addition to the slight decline in unprocessed food price inflation. Inflation expectations continue to be elevated; however, companies' expectations for retail and services prices have remained below their peak levels seen in the summer. The effects causing a turnaround in inflation are expected to strengthen in the coming months. Global energy, commodity and food prices have fallen to the levels seen before the Russia-Ukraine war. In addition, the moderating effect on pricing arising from the fall in domestic demand and, from the spring months, the fading of base effects will support the decline in inflation. Tight monetary conditions contribute to avoiding second-round inflationary effects and anchoring inflation expectations. Domestic inflation is expected to decrease slowly in the first half of 2023, and then more significantly from the middle of the year. The consumer price index will return to the central bank tolerance band in 2024. According to the press release by the Ministry of Finance the deficit target of 6.1 percent was achieved in 2022, with the government debt-to-GDP decreasing to 73.5 percent. A trend reversal in the current account balance has started in recent months, as exports expanded significantly, gas prices moderated, and household consumption adjusted. The higher-than-expected trade deficit in November was mainly due to one-off factors. From 2023, the increasing surplus in items of the current account excluding the energy balance, growing adjustment in the energy market and a decline in gas prices may lead to a rapid improvement. With the normalising global economic environment and terms of trade, as well as with the utilisation of new export capacities built recently, the trade balance will improve significantly, and as a result, the current account deficit is expected to be reduced further. The Monetary Council kept the base rate at 13 percent at its meeting today. The current level of the base rate is adequate to manage fundamental inflation risks. The O/N deposit rate and the O/N collateralised borrowing rate were left unchanged at 12.5 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Using its instruments introduced in the autumn to absorb interbank liquidity on a long-term basis, i.e. the revised reserve requirement system, the one-week discount bill and the long-term deposit tender, the MNB strongly supported the maintenance of the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission over the year-end period. Based on this positive experience, the MNB will use these instruments regularly in the coming period. Accordingly, the Bank will hold its long-term deposit tender on 25 January, and from 1 February discount bill auctions will be held on a weekly basis. In addition to strengthening monetary policy transmission, the Bank will continue to use one-day deposit quick tenders and FX swap transactions to ensure financial market stability, and it will continue to meet foreign currency liquidity needs in the coming months to reach market balance related to the energy account. The Monetary Council is constantly assessing incoming data and developments in the outlook for inflation and is ready to take appropriate actions if risks increase. Looking ahead, maintaining market stability and strengthening monetary policy transmission are also key to achieving price stability. The MNB still focuses on sustained shifts in financial market conditions, and it will maintain the current terms of its instruments introduced in mid-October until a trend improvement in risk perceptions occurs. It is necessary to maintain tight monetary conditions over a prolonged period, which will ensure that inflation expectations are anchored and the inflation target is achieved in a sustainable manner."
Nigeria,2023-01-24,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 146 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON MONDAY 23rd AND TUESDAY 24th JANUARY 2023 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held its first meeting for 2023 on the 23rd and 24th January, 2023, as optimism of a rebound in global output recovery waned considerably, giving room for increased concerns of a likely global recession in 2023. This is driven by several global shocks impacting negatively on growth and price development. Major headwinds to global growth include: ongoing geopolitical tensions in some regions; intensified disruptions to the energy market; persisting supply bottlenecks; resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in major industrial cities in China; and tightening external financial conditions. In addition to these, the slow growth in global trade, continued volatility in the oil market and growing private and public debt portfolios, are clear signals of increasing uncertainty, imposing a drag on growth. In the domestic economy, output growth recovery was subdued in the third quarter of 2022, but expected to recover moderately in the fourth quarter on the back of continued support of both monetary and fiscal policy through various interventions in growth-enhancing sectors. At this meeting, the Committee reviewed these and other developments in the global and domestic economic and financial environments in 2022, as well as the outlook and risks for 2023. Twelve (12) members of the Committee attended this meeting. Global Economic Developments The Committee noted with concern, the growing evidence of increased militarization of the war in Ukraine and the consequence of a prolonged war 1 CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall on the recovery of the global economy. It also noted the renewed concern of the possibility of yet another Pandemic reverberating the global economy in 2023, as infection rates rise in China, following its lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. These two factors alongside the tightening of global financial conditions remain major headwinds to global economic growth. The combined impact of these shocks on the global economy could result in further disruptions to commodity and energy markets as well as the efficient functioning of global supply chains. In the Advanced Economies, fiscal policy retreated to give way to monetary adjustment, while in the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies, fiscal capacity is being greatly undermined by the array of shock spillovers from the global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its October 2022 World Economic Outlook, retained its global output growth projection for 2022 at 32 per cent, but further downgraded in the 2023 forecast to 27 per cent compared with 29 per cent in its July 2022 forecast. The World Bank in its latest forecast, indicated a much lower global growth expectation of 17 per cent for 2023. On price development, the MPC observed that inflation, in most Advanced Economies, although trending downwards, remained significantly above their long-run objectives and is expected to remain elevated throughout 2023. This is driven by the continued high price of food and energy, a fallout of the war in Ukraine, lagged impact of the massive liquidity support rolled out to douse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and persisting disruptions to the global supply chain as China faces a renewed surge of the Pandemic. Fears that Russia may renege on its commitment to the Black Sea grains deal is also building expectations of possible rise in short-term price levels. In the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies, inflation is expected to moderate marginally in 2023, but remain broadly elevated due to a combination of factors such as the persisting high price of grains and other commodities; continued exchange rate pressures; and other legacy structural factors. In the global financial markets, the continued normalisation of monetary policy has led to the tightening of external financial conditions and increased volatility 2 CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall in the equities market. With the increased fears of a likely global recession in 2023, investors have commenced a move towards safe-haven assets such as gold and silver to safeguard their investments. In the Advanced Economies, corporate debt levels remain considerably high as pressure builds to avoid default scenarios with the continued hike of monetary policy rates. In the Emerging Market and Developing Economies, the persistence of rising public debt profiles and capital flow reversals are putting severe pressure on exchange rates, posing a challenge to external sustainability. Domestic Economic Developments Available data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) revealed that Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 225 per cent (year-on-year) in the third quarter of 2022, compared with 354 per cent in the second quarter of 2022 and 403 per cent in the corresponding period of 2021. The economy has continued on a path of positive growth for eight consecutive quarters. This is driven largely by support by the Bank and the fiscal authority to growth enhancing sectors. Staff projections showed that output growth recovery is expected to continue reasonably in 2023, given the expected sustained positive performance during the fourth quarter of 2022 and steady rebound in economic activities. The MPC welcomed the moderation in inflation following ten consecutive months of uptick, as headline inflation (year-on-year) declined marginally to 2134 per cent in December 2022 from 2147 per cent in November 2022. Month- on-month headline inflation however, increased to 171 per cent in December 2022 from 139 per cent in the preceding month, due to a rise in consumer spending during the festive period. The Committee observed the continued growth in money supply with broad money (M3) growth exceeding the 2022 provisional benchmark of 1521 per cent at 1652 per cent (year-to-date) in December 2022, compared with 1392 per cent in November 2022. This was largely driven by increased claims on other 3 CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall sectors (other financial corporations, state and local governments, public nonfinancial corporations, and the private sector). Money market rates oscillated below and within the asymmetric corridor of the standing facilities window, reflecting changing liquidity conditions in the banking system. Accordingly the monthly weighted average Open Buyback (OBB) rate decreased to 1161 per cent in December 2022 from 1256 per cent in November 2022, while the monthly average inter-bank rate, increased to 1208 per cent in December 2022 from 1189 per cent in November 2022. The MPC noted the continued resilience of the banking system, evidenced by the progressive improvement in the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio from 49 per cent in November 2022 to 42 per cent in December 2022. The Committee also noted that the liquidity ratio was well above its prudential limit at 441 per cent, while the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) remained at 138 per cent in December 2022 compared with the preceding month, staying within its prudential range of 100 -150 per cent. The equities market was bullish in the review period, as the All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalization (MC) increased to 51,,25106 and N2792 trillion on December 30, 2022, from 43,,83908 and N2388 trillion respectively, on October 31, 2022. This reflected better-than-expected corporate earnings and improved investor confidence in the country. The Committee noted the marginal decline in the external reserves, as gross external reserves decreased by 095 per cent at end-December 2022 to US$3655 billion, from US$369 billion at end-November 2022. This reflects the exchange rate pressure accentuated by a combination of heightened demand and slow accretion to reserves. The Committee reviewed the performance of the Bank's various interventions aimed at stimulating production and productivity across the real sector. Between September and October 2022, under the Anchor Borrowers' Programme (ABP), the Bank disbursed N4102 billion to several agricultural 4 CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall projects, bringing the cumulative disbursements under the Programme to ₦1,,06729 billion to over 46 million smallholder farmers cultivating or rearing 21 commodities across the country. The Bank also released N300 million to finance large-scale agricultural projects under the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme (CACS), bringing the total disbursements under the Scheme to ₦74531 billion for 680 projects in agro-production and agro-processing. In addition, the Bank released the sum of ₦4830 billion under the ₦10 trillion Real Sector Facility to seven new real sector projects in agriculture, manufacturing, and services. Cumulative disbursements under the Real Sector Facility currently stood at ₦215 trillion disbursed to 437 projects across the country, comprising 240 in manufacturing, 91 in agriculture, 93 in services and 13 mining sector projects. Furthermore under the 100 for 100 Policy on Production and Productivity (PPP), the Bank has disbursed the sum of ₦2078 billion to nine projects in healthcare, manufacturing, and services. This brings the cumulative disbursements under the facility to ₦11417 billion to 71 projects across healthcare, manufacturing, services and agriculture. The Bank released ₦400 billion under the Intervention Facility for the National Gas Expansion Programme (IFNGEP) to promote the adoption of compressed natural gas (CNG) as the preferred fuel for transportation and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as the preferred cooking fuel. In the MSME sector, the Bank supported entrepreneurship development with the disbursement of the sums of N133 billion and N1000 million under the Agribusiness/Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme (AgSMEIS) and Micro. Small, and Medium Enterprise Development Fund (MSMEDF), respectively, to support entrepreneurship development in the country, bringing the total disbursement under the interventions to N15022 billion and N9608 billion, respectively. Under the Export Facilitation Initiative (EFI), the Bank funded export-oriented projects with the sum of N534 billion, bringing the cumulative disbursement under the intervention to N4458 billion. CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall Outlook The broad outlook for the recovery of both the global and domestic economies remain uncertain with the path to full recovery clouded by significant downside risks. The key risks remain the lingering headwinds from the Russian-Ukraine war, heightened inflationary pressure across several economies and sharp slowdown of economic activities in China with the resurgence of COVID-19 pandemic across its major cities. Others include: the tightening of external financial conditions, as monetary policy normalization continues; increasing risk of a global debt crisis, as both corporate and public debt levels burgeon; and the increasing likelihood of a global recession in 2023. Available data and forecasts for key macroeconomic indicators for Nigeria suggest that the economy will continue to grow through 2023, but at a subdued pace. The continued high level of insecurity; perennial scarcity of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) and high cost of other energy sources; increased spending towards the 2023 general elections; rising cost of debt servicing; and deteriorating fiscal balances, remain the key sources of shocks to the Nigerian economy. Accordingly the economy is forecast to grow in 2023 by 288 per cent by the CBN estimate. The Committee's Considerations At this meeting, although the MPC was delighted that inflation (year-on-year) had started to moderate, it was not convinced that a marginal 13 basis points dip in inflation was enough to begin to celebrate. The Committee was therefore not of the opinion that a hold or loosen option was desirable. This is because loosening under a double-digit inflationary condition will be tantamount to an immediate reversal of the expected further downward trend in inflation. Committee also felt that loosening will negate the objective of dampening the pent-up aggregate demand that fueled the rise in inflation post-COVID-19 pandemic. CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall As for hold, the Committee was reluctant in considering this option because a hold option would signal MPC's quick adjustment of its policy stance due to a one-time, marginal decline in inflation, suggesting a weak confidence in its previous policy stance at taming inflation. The MPC was therefore unanimous in its position to continue to tighten. However the dilemma at this meeting was whether to continue tightening aggressively or moderately. To the Committee, a moderate tightening may slow the rate of deceleration in inflation without necessarily hurting output. For those members who felt that an aggressive stance was needed, they were of the view that Nigeria's inflation at a rate above 20 per cent, was already a threat to growth and among the highest in the world. To this group of members, aggressively raising the policy rate was paramount to reining in inflation because an aggressive tightening stance would further narrow the negative real interest rate margin. MPC also feels that a tightening stance would signal confidence in the effectiveness of its Monetary Policy direction to rein in inflation, improve financial system stability, and moderate exchange rate. The Committee's Decision Members welcomed the recent deceleration in year-on-year headline inflation, noting that the persistence in policy rate hikes over the last few meetings of the Committee had started to yield the expected decline in inflation. The Committee thus deliberated on either to hike rates further or hold for the impact of the last four rate hikes to continue to feed through. At this MPC, therefore, the options considered were primarily to hold the policy rate or tighten further to consolidate the gains of previous rate hikes. Loosening in the view of members, would gravely undermine the gains of the last four rate hikes. The MPC noted the continued upward risk to price development characterized by the forthcoming 2023 general elections; perennial scarcity of PMS; continued rise in other energy prices; exchange rate pressure; as well as rising insecurity. Members however, noted that the current naira redesign and cash withdrawal 7 CCllaassssiiffiieedd aass CCoonnffiiddeennttiiaall limit policies are huge moderating factors to price development as Currency- Outside-Banks is expected to continue to moderate beyond the implementation stage of these policies. The MPC was of the view that although the inflation rate moderated marginally in December, the economy remained confronted with the risk of high inflation with adverse consequences on the general standard of living. The Committee, therefore, decided to sustain the current stance of policy at this point in time to further rein in inflation. One member voted to increase the MPR by 150 basis points. Four members by 50 basis points, and Seven members by 100 basis points. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Raise the MPR by 100 basis points to 175 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 325 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor.

Thailand,2023-01-25,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 1/2023 Mr. Piti Disyatat. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 25 January 2023 as follows. The Committee votes unanimously to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 125 to 150 percent, effective immediately. The Thai economy will continue to gain traction with continued recovery in tourism and private consumption thanks to the return of Chinese tourists. Meanwhile merchandise exports will slow down this year but are expected to improve in 2024 in line with the global economic recovery. Headline inflation is expected to decline, whereas core inflation remains at a high level with increased risks from demand-side inflationary pressures due to the economic recovery. The Committee deems that a continuing gradual policy normalization is an appropriate course for monetary policy consistent with the growth and inflation outlook, and thus votes to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point at this meeting. The Thai economy is projected to continue growing. The tourism sector will exhibit a faster recovery following the return of Chinese tourists. This will contribute to a more broad-based improvement in employment and income of services sector and self-employed workers, which account a significant share of total employment. Such improvements will support the continued expansion of private consumption. Meanwhile growth of merchandise exports will moderate this year, but is expected to resume in 2024 in tandem with global growth which is projected to bottom out in 2023. The Committee assesses that downside risks to the global economy have decreased given the improving outlook in both advanced economies and China. Headline inflation is projected to decline. Supply-side inflationary pressures will continue to dissipate along with a decline in global energy and commodity prices. Core inflation is expected to remain at a high level for some time before gradually decreasing. Meanwhile medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range. However there is a risk that core inflation would remain high for longer than expected owing to a potential increase in pass-through given elevated costs. Moreover the tourism recovery could increase demand-side inflationary pressures. The Committee will therefore continue to closely monitor risks to inflation. Overall financial system remains resilient. Commercial banks maintain high levels of capital and loan loss provision. Debt serviceability of households and businesses has improved in line with the economic recovery. However the financial positions of some SMEs 2 and households remain fragile and sensitive to the rising living costs and debt burden. The Committee views that financial institutions should continue to press ahead with debt restructuring and deems it important to have targeted measures and sustainable solutions in place for vulnerable groups. Overall financial conditions are less accommodative. Funding costs have risen in tandem with the policy rate increases as well as the expiration of reduction in the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF) contribution. However bank lending and bond issuances continue to increase. The baht against the US dollar has appreciated owing to expectations of a less aggressive tightening of the Fed as well as China's relaxation of international travel restrictions which would benefit the Thai tourism sector. Nevertheless the Committee will continue to closely monitor developments in the financial market and volatilities in the foreign exchange market. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee judges that Thai economic recovery remains on track. However risks of rising demand-side inflationary pressures must be monitored. The policy rate should be normalized to the level that is consistent with sustainable growth in the long term in a gradual and measured manner. The Committee is ready to adjust the size and timing of policy normalization should the growth and inflation outlook shift from the current assessment."
Chile,2023-01-26,"NoPtrae sds eR epleraesne s*a Thursday, 26 January 2023 Monetary Policy Meeting  January 2023 At At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile agreed to hold the monetary policy interest rate at 11.25%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of its members. World inflation has declined at the margin, mainly associated with a reduction in energy prices. However, it is still high and inflationary pressures remain significant. In this context, the main central banks have kept raising their benchmark interest rates. The growth outlook for 2023 remains weak, despite a slight upward adjustment. Global financial markets have reflected greater optimism, fueled by China's easing of its zero- Covid policy and the prospects of a less restrictive monetary policy path by the Federal Reserve. Since the last Meeting, the dollar has depreciated globally, risk appetite and capital flows to emerging economies have increased, stock markets have risen and long-term interest rates have shown mixed movements. Commodity prices have evolved heterogeneously. The price of copper rose significantly, to US$4.2 per pound (+11% since the last Meeting), driven by improved demand prospects from China, while oil is trading around US$83 per barrel (+5% since the last Meeting, for the WTI-Brent average). The local financial market has followed global trends. With respect to the last Meeting, the IPSA and long-term interest rates are virtually unchanged, while the exchange rate appreciated around 8%, somewhat more than comparable currencies. The macroeconomic implications of the recent appreciation of the peso will be assessed in the next Monetary Policy Report. Bank credit continues to be contained, especially in the commercial portfolio. The context in which this takes place is one where supply conditions remain tight and demand has continued to weaken. In November, the non-mining Imacec declined once again, posting a 0.2% monthly drop in its seasonally adjusted series (-0.8% for the total Imacec). From the expenditure standpoint, consumption- and investment-related indicators continue to adjust, such as the performance of retail trade, imports and low construction activity. The labor market continues to show low job creation and declines in the annual variation of real wages. All this in a context of persistently pessimistic consumer and business expectations. Last December, headline and core inflation stood at 12.8% and 10.7% annually, respectively, both down from the previous month. Nonetheless, inflation accumulated in the last two months exceeded the projection of the December Monetarty Policy Report, owing mostly to the November figure. Inflation expectations two years ahead remain above 3%. Monetary policy has made a significant adjustment and is facilitating the resolution of the imbalances present in the economy. However, inflation remains very high and its convergence to the 3% target is still subject to risks. The Board will maintain the MPR at 11.25% until the state of the macroeconomy indicates that this process has been consolidated. Nota de prensa The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Friday, 10 February 2023. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will take place on Tuesday, 4 April 2023, and the statement thereof will be released at 18:00 hours of the same day. The Spanish original prevails.

Ukraine,2023-01-26,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 25% per annum and to continue raising required reserves ratios for banks. This will facilitate a further increase in the attractiveness of hryvnia assets, support exchange rate stability, and gradually slow inflation. Inflation has stabilized in the past months but is still high. As of the end of 2022, consumer prices grew by 26.6%. At the same time, in the past three months, inflation remained almost unchanged in annual terms. The de-occupation of territories, an increase in supply of food products, and consumer demand being dampened by russia's energy terror helped stabilize the inflationary pressure. Inflation was also restrained by unchanged utility tariffs, the fixed exchange rate of the hryvnia, and improved logistics. The NBU's measures, in particular to introduce deposit instruments to hedge the FX risk, as well as limited volumes of monetary financing of the budget, contributed to a more stable FX market at the end of 2022. At the same time, the price pressure remained strong due to consequences of the war, such as the destruction of enterprises and infrastructure and disruption of production and supply chains. Moreover, business costs continued to grow on the back of russia's energy terror. Despite a stabilization, inflation expectations remained high. Inflation will decline gradually and will remain under control thanks to measures taken by the NBU and the government and the support provided by international partners. The NBU forecasts inflation will slow to 18.7% in 2023, supported by monetary conditions remaining tight, global inflation declining, and consumer demand being dampened by power outages. Inflows of announced international assistance and joint efforts of the NBU and the government to revive the domestic debt market will help avoid monetary financing of the budget deficit and balance the FX market. In the next years, inflation will decelerate more rapidly thanks to subsiding security risks, proper recovery of logistics, and larger harvests. The NBU expects inflation to decline to 10.4% in 2024 and 6.7% in 2025. The administered prices component will make a major contribution to inflation during these years due to the need to bring utility tariffs to market levels. The economic recovery ceased due to russia's terror attacks against energy infrastructure. As security risks subside. Ukraine will return to steady economic growth in 20242025. Russia's energy terror deepened the decline in Ukraine's GDP in Q4 2022 (to 35% yoy). Trading businesses and the services sector adapted to power outages rather quickly. The impact on agriculture was also limited. On the other hand, industrial production was affected heavily, especially the metals industry. At the same time, thanks to improved results of Q3 and the rapid adaptation of a part of businesses and households to the new conditions, estimates of the decline in real GDP in 2022 were improved to 30.3%. The NBU expects growth in real GDP to be weak in 2023, at 0.3%. The deterioration of the forecast compared to the October estimates was primarily caused by consequences of energy terror and the revision of the main assumption of the duration of security risks. The latter will delay the full unblocking of ports, which will limit the potential of recovery in exports. Moreover, the NBU expects harvests will also be weaker this year as a result of accumulated problems with sowing and harvesting amid the war. At the same time, the forecast assumes Ukraine will manage to avoid further significant destruction of its energy infrastructure while businesses and authorities will take effective measures to neutralize the consequences of the damage inflicted earlier. The economy will grow in 20242025, driven by a decline in security risks, along with a resumption of proper operation of ports, an increase in harvests, a gradual recovery in production, an improvement in logistics, and a pick up in domestic demand, including thanks to the return of displaced persons. The loose fiscal policy will also to play an important role. All of the above will push up Ukraine's real GDP by 4.1% in 2024, and in 2025 economic growth will accelerate to 6.4%. Limited exports, a large number of displaced persons abroad, and the economy's large needs for imports to carry out the reconstruction will cause the current account deficit to be high in the coming years. In the past months, exports of Ukrainian goods remained stable despite massive missile attacks and russia's efforts to disrupt the operation of the grain corridor. On the other hand, imports rose significantly compared to previous periods due to the need to purchase backup power devices and fuel as a result of the energy terror. This led to an increase in the deficit of the trade balance. The trade deficit was offset by inflows of official financing, including grants, and steady remittances from labor migrants. As a result, the current account recorded a surplus as of the end of 2022. The current account deficit is expected to be large in 2023. First, the deficit in the trade in goods will widen rapidly. Exports will decrease due to weaker harvests and electricity shortages, whereas imports will grow fueled by higher demand for energy and goods needed to ensure the autonomous power supply. Second, spending by displaced persons abroad will be larger than expected as security risks are persisting for a longer time. Exports will start to grow from 2024, and Ukrainians will return home more actively. However, large needs for imports to conduct the reconstruction of the country will keep the current account in the deficit. International aid, coupled with cooperation with the IMF, will finance Ukraine's substantial budget deficit, and maintain international reserves at a sufficient level. In 2022. Ukraine received over USD 32 billion in international assistance, of which over USD 14 billion was in the form of grants. This enabled the country to finance a larger portion of the consolidated budget deficit (over 27% of GDP, excluding grants), and to increase international reserves, to USD 28.5 billion by the end of the year. Currently, reserves are sufficient to safeguard the stability of the FX market. In view of the already announced international aid and progress made in negotiations with the IMF, overall official financing in 2023 could exceed USD 38 billion. This will enable Ukraine to refrain from the monetary financing of the budget deficit in 2023, and to maintain international reserves at a sufficient level even in the face of longer-lasting high security risks. International reserves are expected to hit about USD 27 billion by the end of 2023, and will continue to rise. The key assumption of the forecast is that security risks will start to decline significantly from early 2024. An extended full-scale war by russia and further destruction of critical infrastructure remain the key risks. The NBU has revised its key assumption of the security situation forecast due to fiercer fighting and escalating terrorist attacks on the country's critical infrastructure. The baseline scenario of the new macroeconomic forecast envisages a noticeable decrease in security risks from the start of 2024. Therefore, the full unblocking of sea ports and reductions in Ukraine's risk premiums have been delayed in the NBU's forecast. More intense hostilities and greater power shortages than expected due to russia's terrorist attacks could dampen economic activity more significantly, while also increasing inflationary pressures. Other risks also have a bearing on the forecast. If materialized, they could also require revisions in key macroeconomic indicators. the emergence of additional budgetary needs and substantial quasi-fiscal deficits in the energy sector on the back of the unpredictable nature of the wardelayed returns by a large number of Ukrainians and potential additional migration abroad, which will depress consumer demand, while in the longer term, this threatens to aggravate structural problems on the labor market and decrease the country's economic potentialthe irregular arrival of external financing complications in the operation of the grain corridor, even despite this risk weakening in recent months.That said, the rapid implementation of the recovery plan for Ukraine, supported by the arrival of official and private financing, could markedly speed up economic growth. In order to bring inflation back to the steady decline trajectory and to maintain exchange rate and macrofinancial stability amid high uncertainty, the NBU Board decided to keep the key policy rate at 25%. At the same time, the NBU has raised reserve requirements for banks, as it said it would do in December. More specifically, from 11 February the banks' required reserve ratios will be raised by 5 pp for demand deposits from, and current accounts of, businesses and households; for deposits from, and current accounts of, nonresident banks; and for loans from international (other than financial) and other organizations. In particular, from 5% to 10% for hryvnia funds and from 15% to 20% for FX funds. What is more, from 11 March the banks' required reserve ratios will be raised by another 10 pp for household hryvnia and FX demand deposits and current accounts. The banks will not be allowed to use benchmark domestic government debt securities to meet these reserve requirements. The NBU expects that these measures will help decrease the liquidity surplus in the banking system. This, in turn, will encourage the banks to compete more actively for term deposits, which will push up interest rates on hryvnia assets and increase the share of term deposits. This will make the FX market more resilient to situational factors, while also enabling the NBU to ease administrative restrictions for businesses and households in future. The revised forecast envisages keeping the key policy rate at 25% at least until the end of Q1 2024. If required, the NBU stands ready to deploy other tools to avoid the monetary financing of the budget deficit, make hryvnia assets more attractive, increase the resilience of the FX market, and lay the proper foundations for easing administrative restrictions. А new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 2 February 2023. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 25% per annum, was approved by an NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No. 36, dated 26 January 2023. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 6 February 2023. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 16 March 2023, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
South Africa,2023-01-26,"PRESS STATEMENT 26 January 2023 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank As this year commences, high inflation and weak economic growth continue to shape global conditions. Russia's war in the Ukraine drags on and recession risks remain elevated in the Euro Area, even though energy constraints have eased. Growth prospects for the United States this year are lower. The growth outlook for China has improved but is likely to remain modest by historical standards. In the developing world, a number of economies face debt distress, exacerbated by tighter global financial conditions.1 Last year, higher than expected headline inflation and rising core inflation led major central banks to accelerate the normalisation of policy rates. With advanced economy interest rates likely to increase in the near term, we expect financial asset prices globally to remain volatile. 1 According to the IMF's October 2022 Global Financial Stability Report, eight low-income countries are in debt distress and 30 are at high risk of distress (out of 69 countries considered low-income countries—among which, there are some frontier markets). MPC Statement 26 January 2023 Page 1. MPC Statement 26 January 2023 Page 1 Taking these and other factors into account, the SARB's forecast for global growth in 2023 is revised slightly lower to 1.6% (from 1.9%).2 We expect better growth in 2024 at 2.6% (from 2.4%). The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) global growth forecast will be updated later this month. While the South African economy grew by a relatively strong 1.6% in the third quarter of 2022, the expansion was not broad-based. We forecast no growth in the fourth quarter. For the whole of last year. GDP growth of 2.5% is expected (up from 1.8%). For 2023, and as a result of extensive load-shedding and other logistical constraints, the Bank now forecasts GDP growth of only 0.3%. Given the scale of load-shedding, the Bank estimates that it deducts as much as 2 percentage points from growth in 2023, compared to the previous estimate of 0.6 percentage points. Over the medium term, the forecast takes into account ongoing high levels of load- shedding, and more modest household spending and investment growth than previously. Investment is still positive, but is revised down due to weaker confidence and lower expected growth. With declining commodity prices, exports are also forecast to be less robust. The forecast incorporates an assumption of increased load-shedding in each year compared to what was pencilled-in at the time of the November meeting.3 2 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. Global growth in 2024 is forecast higher at 2.6% (from 2.4%), before rising to 3.1% in 2025, unchanged from the November meeting. 3 The number of days of expected load-shedding in 2023 has been increased to 250 days from 100 daysIn 2024 the number of days was revised up to 150 days from 40 days. Load-shedding of 100 days has been assumed for 2025. Estimates of the average stages of load-shedding is multiplied by the number of days and then multiplied by the cost to GDP per stage-day. The cost per stage has been revised lower for stages 1 and 2. In nominal terms, these costs vary between R0-R1.2 million for stages 1 and 2 and up to R204-R899 million for stages 3 to 6, when continued on a 24 hour basis on weekdays. MPC Statement 26 January 2023 Page 2. MPC Statement 26 January 2023 Page 2 As a result of these factors, the economy is forecast to expand by 0.7% in 2024 ( down from 1.4%) and by 1.0% in 2025 (down from 1.5%).4 While economic growth has been volatile for some time, prospects for growth appear even more uncertain than normal. A material reduction in load-shedding would significantly raise growth. There could also be higher investment in alternative energy sources as firms and households offset the impact of load-shedding. Upside risks to global growth could also arise from reduced geo-political tensions, a stronger recovery in China, and consequential increases in commodity export prices. With a lower rate of potential, our current reduced growth forecast leaves the output gap around zero, implying little positive or negative impact on inflation from expected growth.5 After the downward revisions to the GDP forecast, the risks to the medium-term domestic growth outlook are assessed to be balanced. As expected for some time, commodity export prices continue to trend gradually lower. While oil prices increased somewhat at the end of last year, compared to November, our oil price forecast is slightly lower, averaging US$89 per barrel in 2023.6 South Africa's export commodity price basket is expected to continue to decrease, by about 18% this year, and stabilise in 2025.7 4 The growth forecast includes expected changes in the policy rate as given by the QPM. 5 Potential growth for 2022 was revised higher to 0.7%, and lowered in 2023 to 0.0%. 6 The Brent crude oil assumptions are US$85 for 2024 and US$80 for 2025 (unchanged). 7 Commodity export prices rose by 1.4% in 2022. MPC Statement 26 January 2023 Page 3. MPC Statement 26 January 2023 Page 3 As a result of weaker export outcomes and prospects, the current account balance is estimated to have been -0.7% of GDP in 2022, and forecast to deteriorate to about - 1.8% for the next three years.8 Although fiscal risk eased over the past year, weaker commodity prices and rising state-owned enterprise financing needs could reverse that positive outcome. Financing conditions for rand-denominated bonds remain tight. Ten-year bond yields currently trade at about 10.3%, despite the expected moderation of inflation over the forecast period. Policy normalisation in major economies and slower global growth last year contributed to depreciation of many emerging market currencies, including the rand. In recent months, while better global growth prospects have increased appetite for riskier assets, the rand has been less buoyant than other currencies. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R16.92 (23q1) to the US dollar, compared with R17.68 at the time of the previous meeting. Globally, economic growth has slowed and prices decreased for some goods and transport services. While headline inflation eased in major economies in December, price pressures continue to spread from goods to services and wages.9 Our estimate for inflation in the G3 is unchanged at 7.3% in 2022 and slightly lower to 4.0% in 2023 (from 4.1%). 9 Inflation in agricultural commodities decelerated to 0.1% in 2022Q4 (from 8.7% in 2022Q3) due to vegetable oils and cereals components. This year global food inflation is expected to be in deflation (after registering 14.3% in 2022) due to base effects and improving supply constraints. 10 The G3 comprises the United States, the Eurozone, and Japan. The latest CPI inflation in the respective components sits at 6.5%, 9.2% and 4%. We expect G3 inflation of 1.9% in 2025. MPC Statement 26 January 2023 Page 4. MPC Statement 26 January 2023 Page 4 Although South Africa's fuel price inflation for last year averaged 34.5%, it is expected to be -2.7% in 2023 (down from 0.7%). While global food price inflation continues to ease, local food price inflation is revised up again in part due to the lagged impact of the weaker exchange rate. Headline inflation in 2022 came out at 6.9%. The Bank's forecast of headline inflation for 2023 is unchanged at 5.4% and is slightly higher at 4.8% for 2024. In 2025 we still expect headline inflation of 4.5%. Our forecast for core inflation is somewhat lower at 5.2% in 2023 (down from 5.5%) and 4.7% in 2024 (down from 4.8%). Services price inflation in 2023 is forecast to be 5.1%, lower than the 5.5% previously expected, on the back of lower public transport services, housing rental price inflation and owners equivalent rent. Core goods inflation is also forecast somewhat lower for this year at 5.5% (from 5.7%).11 The forecast for core inflation in 2024 and 2025 is largely unchanged at 4.7% and 4.5%, respectively. 11 Core goods refers to total CPI goods excluding food and NAB, fuel and electricity, whereas services include all surveyed services within the CPI basket. MPC Statement 26 January 2023 Page 5. MPC Statement 26 January 2023 Page 5 The forecast for average salary growth is broadly unchanged.12 Despite a benign unit labour cost outcome in 2022, lower productivity and higher inflation expectations raise the forecast for this year and next.13 While core inflation in December came out significantly better than expected, increases in electricity and food price inflation and higher headline inflation for 2022 as a whole keep the headline inflation forecast elevated in the near and medium-term. Risks to the inflation outlook are assessed to the upside. Despite some easing of global producer price and food inflation, global price levels remain elevated and Russia's war in the Ukraine continues. The oil market is expected to remain tight, particularly as China's economy rebounds. Electricity price inflation has shifted significantly higher this year and next and other administered prices continue to present clear medium-term risks. Domestic food price inflation continues to surprise higher and may again. Load-shedding may have broader price effects on the cost of doing business and the cost of living. Given sticky petrol and food price inflation, considerable risk still attaches to the forecast for average salaries and hence for the trajectory of core inflation. G3 interest rate levels for the forecast period are similar to those projected in November, averaging 3.7% in 2023 (up from 3.6%), 3.3% in 2024, and 2.4% in 2025. Tightened global financial conditions have raised the risk profiles of economies needing foreign capital. While the rand appreciated in December alongside other emerging market currencies, it has depreciated by about 1.6% against the USD year 12 Average salaries were expected to be 5.3%, 6.7%, and 5.4% for 2022, 2023 and 2024 at the time of the November meeting. For the January meeting, the respective figures are 5.2%, 6.9%, 5.5%, and 4.7% for 2025. 13 Unit labour costs are forecast to have grown by 3.6% in 2022, below the forecast of 4.4%. Productivity per unit of labour is lower due to reduced expected output. MPC Statement 26 January 2023 Page 6. MPC Statement 26 January 2023 Page 6 to date. Given deteriorated growth prospects, the risk of currency weakness has increased. Inflation expectations increased strongly over the past year. Average expectations of future inflation surveyed in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased to 6.1% for 2023 and 5.6% for 2024.14 Expectations for inflation in 2023 based on market surveys sit at 5.5%.15 Long-term inflation expectations derived from the 5-year break-even rates in the bond market have moderated to about 5.0%.16 In the second quarter of 2022, headline inflation breached the upper end of the target range, and is forecast to remain above it until the second quarter of this year. Headline inflation is only expected to sustainably revert to the mid-point of the target range by the fourth quarter of 2024. The forecast takes into account the policy rate trajectory indicated by the Bank's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM). As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting in response to new data and risks. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 7.25% per year, with effect from the 27th of January 2023. Three members of the Committee preferred the announced increase. Two members preferred a 50 basis points increase. 14 The BER Q4 survey of inflation expectations indicated inflation at 6.1% in 2023 (up from 5.9%) and 5.6% for 2024 (up from 5.3%). 15 At the median, market analysts (Reuters Econometer) in January expect inflation to be higher at 5.5% (from 5.4% in November) in 2023, 4.7% in 2024 and 4.7% in 2025. 16 Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These now sit at about 4.95% for the 5-year and 5.91% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year break-even inflation sits at 6.41%. MPC Statement 26 January 2023 Page 7. MPC Statement 26 January 2023 Page 7 The revised repurchase rate remains supportive of credit demand in the near term, while raising rates to levels more consistent with the current view of inflation and risks to it. The aim of policy is to anchor inflation expectations more firmly around the mid- point of the target band and to increase confidence of attaining the inflation target sustainably over time.17 Guiding inflation back towards the mid-point of the target band can reduce the economic costs of high inflation and enable lower interest rates in the future. Achieving a prudent public debt level, increasing the supply of energy, moderating administered price inflation and keeping wage growth in line with productivity gains would enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy. Economic and financial conditions are expected to remain more volatile for the foreseeable future. In this uncertain environment, monetary policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. The MPC will seek to look through temporary price shocks and focus on potential second round effects and the risks of de-anchoring inflation expectations. The Bank will continue to closely monitor funding markets for stress. Lesetja Kganyago GOVERNOR The next statement of the Monetary Policy Committee will be released on 30 March 2023. 17 The forecasted trajectory for the repurchase rate implies a rise in the inflation-adjusted repo rate from -1.7% in 2021 to -1.9% in 2022, 2.0% for 2023, and 2.3% in 2024. The real repo level for 2025 is expected to be 2.4%. The real repurchase rate calculation here is based on the 1-quarter ahead inflation forecast and are annual average rates.

Colombia,2023-01-27,"Five Board Members voted in favor of this decision, and two voted for a 25 bp increase. In their policy discussion, the Board of Directors took the following factors into account. Both headline inflation (13.1%) and core inflation =93 excluding food and regulated items =93 (9.5%) continued their upward trend in December and reached levels higher than those estimated by the technical staff and market analysts. The surge in inflation was due to upward pressure on food prices, indexation at high inflation rates, and the cumulative effects of the depreciation of the peso along with other factors. In line with this, inflation expectations rose over the last month. Leading indicators point to a slowdown in economic activity beginning in the fourth quarter. The Economic Monitoring Indicator (ISE ) registered an annual change of 2.9% in November, which was lower than October's 4.4%. Nevertheless, economic activity levels remain high, and therefore, 8.0% GDP growth is estimated for 2022. For 2023, the technical staff is forecasting 0.2% in GDP growth. Headline inflation has declined as a result of the monetary policy tightening process and the mitigation of supply shocks on shipping costs and international prices of some food and energy products. The improved foreign environment and confidence in Colombia's fiscal outlook have been reflected in a decline in the COP/USD exchange rate. The pace of credit growth has slowed, which favors a moderation in domestic demand, and therefore inflationary pressure in 2023. With today's decision, monetary policy is close to the stance required to induce a convergence of inflation toward its 3.0% target in the medium term. Subsequent decisions by the Board will depend on the new information available. Fecha de publicacion."
Armenia,2023-01-31,"PRESS RELEASE 31.01.2023 Refinancing Rate Set at 10.75% At the January 31, 2023 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged at 10.75%. In December 2022, the 12-month inflation continued to decrease and reached 8.3% at the end of the year. The 12-month core inflation also decreased, reaching 9.5%. At the end of 2022, the slowing of global economic activity and that of the main partner countries to Armenia continued. Likewise, the global inflation is reducing, due to decline of some raw materials and commodity prices. However, a relatively expanded demand still contributes to sustaining the inflationary environment. Therefore, central banks of developed countries will continue to tighten monetary conditions in the near future. This will contribute to the weakening of global demand and some price adjustment in international commodity markets. Subsequently, the inflationary effects on the Armenian economy from the world economy are expected to weaken. At the end of 2022, the economic activity in Armenia remained strong, which continued to be supported by high external demand in the services sector. At the same time, trends of increasing export and potential GDP have sustained. As a result of the implemented contractionary monetary policy, the dram appreciation, and weakening of the inflationary impact from the external sector, the overall inflation environment in Armenia is gradually mitigating. High demand is also reflected in the labor market and contributes to the growth of wages and prices of individual goods and services. The Board of the CBA finds it appropriate to leave the policy rate unchanged. The Board of the CBA will be committed to ensuring price stabilization and prevent any risk of unanchoring of inflation expectations. According to the outlined monetary policy scenario, the 12-month inflation will gradually decline and, starting from end-2023, stabilize around the 4% target. The Board of the CBA estimates that the risks of inflation deviation from the projected path are mainly balanced; should the risks materialize in any direction, the Board stands ready to respond accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective. Detailed information on the basis for determining the interest rate can be found in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by February 14, 2023."
Brazil,2023-02-01,"In its 252nd meeting. Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. The following observations provide an update of Copom's scenario:. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; the still heightened uncertainty about the country's future fiscal framework and fiscal stimuli that support aggregate demand, partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset prices; and an output gap tighter than the one currently adopted by the Committee in its reference scenario, especially in the labor market. Among the downside risks, it should be noted an additional reduction in the prices of international commodities measured in local currency; a greater than projected deceleration of global economic activity; and the continuity of tax cuts assumed to be reversed in 2023. The current scenario, particularly uncertain on the fiscal side and with inflation expectations drifting away from the inflation target on longer horizons, requires further attention in the conduct of monetary policy. The Committee judges that this scenario raises the cost of the disinflation that is needed to reach the targets established by the National Monetary Council. In this scenario. Copom reaffirms its commitment to set monetary policy to meet the targets. Considering the assessed scenarios, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information. Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective inflation, an even higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and, to a larger degree, 2024. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing economic fluctuations and fostering full employment. The Committee remains vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a longer period than in the reference scenario will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets, which have shown deterioration at longer horizons since the previous meeting. The Committee reinforces that future monetary policy steps can be adjusted and will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto de Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Diogo Abry Guillen. Fernanda Magalhaes Rumenos Guardado. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza and Renato Dias de Brito Gomes. * In the reference scenario, the interest rate path is extracted from the Focus survey, and the exchange rate starts at USD/BRL 5.15 and evolves according to the purchasing power parity (PPP). The Committee assumes that oil prices follow approximately the futures market curve for the following six months and then start increasing 2% per year onwards. Moreover, the energy flag is assumed to be ""yellow"" in December 2023 and 2024. The value for the exchange rate is obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Georgia,2023-02-01,"01.02.2023 THE NATIONAL BANK OF GEORGIA KEEPS ITS MONETARY POLICY RATE UNCHANGED AT 11.0 PERCENT On February 1, 2023, the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) decided to keep the monetary policy rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged. The monetary policy rate stands at 11.0 percent. Annual inflation in Georgia has already passed the peak and follows a downward trend, mainly driven by the gradual neutralization of the external factors. In particular, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the international food price index has been decreasing since March last year. At the same time, international shipping costs continue to decline and as of December 2022 have fell down almost to the pre-pandemic level. These trends, against the backdrop of a stronger exchange rate, are being transmitted to the local market and reduce imported inflation. Both prolonged period of tight monetary policy and fiscal consolidation support the reduction of headline inflation. According to the updated macroeconomic forecast, other things being equal, given tight monetary policy annual inflation will continue to decline and approach the target level in the second half of 2023. Positive trends in international markets give grounds for cautious optimism; however, due to the current geopolitical situation, uncertainty is still high, and existing risks for inflation are mainly on the upside. At the same time, despite the slowdown, inflation is still above the target and amounted to 9.8 percent in December. As a result of consecutive shocks, inflation has deviated from its target level for a long period of time, reinforcing inflation expectations. On the other hand, against the backdrop of inflationary shocks, local wage growth has recently exceeded the growth rate of labor productivity, which makes the inflationary pressure from the labor market noteworthy. Given the current high uncertainty and inflationary risks, the National Bank of Georgia is still concentrated on reducing inflation. In order to eliminate additional inflationary pressure and reduce the risk of rising inflationary expectations in the medium term, according to the current forecast, the National Bank of Georgia will pursue a tight monetary policy throughout the year. Given a tight policy stance, including the impact of macroprudential instruments implemented recently, credit growth continued to slow down, and this trend is expected to be maintained in the future. In addition, with zero interest paid on required reserves for funds attracted in the US dollar and euro, tightening of global financial conditions further amplifies the effect of tight policy stance on foreign currency loans in Georgia. Monetary policy easing is expected only once actual inflation approaches the target, which should prevent a deterioration of long-term expectations. If an upside pressure on inflation expectations becomes considerable again, it may be necessary to further tighten monetary policy or maintain the current tight stance for a longer period. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on March 29, 2023."
United States,2023-02-01,"EST February 1, 2023 Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated. Russia's war against Ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship and is contributing to elevated global uncertainty. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that (more)could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Euroarea,2023-02-02,"Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. We would like to begin by congratulating Croatia on joining the euro area on 1 January 2023. We also warmly welcome Boris Vujčić, the Governor of Hrvatska narodna banka, to the Governing Council. The Governing Council will stay the course in raising interest rates significantly at a steady pace and in keeping them at levels that are sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. Accordingly, the Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and we expect to raise them further. In view of the underlying inflation pressures, we intend to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points at our next monetary policy meeting in March and we will then evaluate the subsequent path of our monetary policy. Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and will also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. In any event, our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach. The Governing Council today also decided on the modalities for reducing the Eurosystem's holdings of securities under the asset purchase programme (APP). As communicated in December, the APP portfolio will decline by €15 billion per month on average from the beginning of March until the end of June 2023, and the subsequent pace of portfolio reduction will be determined over time. Partial reinvestments will be conducted broadly in line with current practice. In particular, the remaining reinvestment amounts will be allocated proportionally to the share of redemptions across each constituent programme of the APP and, under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), to the share of redemptions of each jurisdiction and across national and supranational issuers. For our corporate bond purchases, the remaining reinvestments will be tilted more strongly towards issuers with a better climate performance. Without prejudice to our price stability objective, this approach will support the gradual decarbonisation of the Eurosystem's corporate bond holdings, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website. The detailed modalities for reducing the APP holdings are described in a separate press release to be published at 15:45 CET. I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. According to Eurostat's preliminary flash estimate, the euro area economy grew by 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022. While above the December Eurosystem staff projections, this outcome means that economic activity has slowed markedly since mid-2022 and we expect it to stay weak in the near term. Subdued global activity and high geopolitical uncertainty, especially owing to Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine and its people, continue to act as headwinds to euro area growth. Together with high inflation and tighter financing conditions, these headwinds dampen spending and production, especially in the manufacturing sector. However, supply bottlenecks are gradually easing, the supply of gas has become more secure, firms are still working off large order backlogs and confidence is improving. Moreover, output in the services sector has been holding up, supported by continuing reopening effects and stronger demand for leisure activities. Rising wages and the recent decline in energy price inflation are also set to ease the loss of purchasing power that many people have experienced owing to high inflation. Overall, the economy has proved more resilient than expected and should recover over the coming quarters. The unemployment rate remained at its historical low of 6.6 per cent in December 2022. However, the rate at which jobs are being created may slow and unemployment could rise over the coming quarters. Government support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should be temporary, targeted and tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy. In particular, as the energy crisis becomes less acute, it is important to now start rolling these measures back promptly in line with the fall in energy prices and in a concerted manner. Any such measures falling short of these principles are likely to drive up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a stronger monetary policy response. Moreover, in line with the EU's economic governance framework, fiscal policies should be oriented towards making our economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area's supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, can help reduce price pressures in the medium term. To that end, governments should swiftly implement their investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme. The reform of the EU's economic governance framework should be concluded rapidly. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, which has been calculated using Eurostat estimates for Germany, inflation was 8.5 per cent in January. This would be 0.7 percentage points lower than the December figure, with the decline owing mainly to a renewed sharp drop in energy prices. Market-based indicators suggest that energy prices over the coming years will be significantly lower than expected at the time of our last meeting. Food price inflation edged higher to 14.1 per cent, as the past surge in the cost of energy and of other inputs for food production is still feeding through to consumer prices. Price pressures remain strong, partly because high energy costs are spreading throughout the economy. Inflation excluding energy and food remained at 5.2 per cent in January, with inflation for non-energy industrial goods rising to 6.9 per cent and services inflation declining to 4.2 per cent. Government measures to compensate households for high energy prices will dampen inflation in 2023 but are expected to raise inflation once they expire. At the same time, the scale of some of these measures depends on the evolution of energy prices and their expected contribution to inflation is particularly uncertain. Although supply bottlenecks are gradually easing, their delayed effects are still pushing up goods price inflation. The same holds true for the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions: while weakening, the effect of pent-up demand is still driving up prices, especially in the services sector. Wages are growing faster, supported by robust labour markets, with some catch-up to high inflation becoming the main theme in wage negotiations. At the same time, recent data on wage dynamics have been in line with the December Eurosystem staff projections. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent, but these warrant continued monitoring. The risks to the outlook for economic growth have become more balanced. Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine and its people continues to be a significant downside risk to the economy and could again push up the costs of energy and food. There could also be an additional drag on euro area growth if the world economy weakened more sharply than we expect. Moreover, the recovery would face obstacles if the pandemic were to re-intensify and cause renewed supply disruptions. However, the energy shock could fade away faster than anticipated and euro area companies could adapt more quickly to the challenging international environment. The risks to the inflation outlook have also become more balanced, especially in the near term. On the upside, existing pipeline pressures could still send retail prices higher in the near term. Moreover, a stronger than expected economic rebound in China could give a fresh boost to commodity prices and foreign demand. Domestic factors such as a persistent rise in inflation expectations above our target or higher than anticipated wage rises could drive inflation higher, also over the medium term. On the downside, the recent fall in energy prices, if it persists, may slow inflation more rapidly than expected. This downward pressure in the energy component could then also translate into weaker dynamics for underlying inflation. A further weakening of demand would also contribute to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term. As we tighten monetary policy, market interest rates are rising further and credit to the private sector is becoming more expensive. Bank lending to firms has decelerated sharply over recent months. But it also reflects weakening demand for loans to finance business investment, in the context of a steep upward move in bank lending rates and a considerable tightening in credit standards, which is also visible in our most recent bank lending survey. Household borrowing has continued to weaken as well, reflecting rising lending rates, tighter credit standards and a sharp fall in the demand for mortgages. As loan creation decelerates, money growth is also slowing rapidly, with a marked decline in its most liquid components, including overnight deposits, only partially compensated by a shift to term deposits. Summing up, the Governing Council will stay the course in raising interest rates significantly at a steady pace and in keeping them at levels that are sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. Accordingly, we today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and we expect to raise them further. In view of the underlying inflation pressures, we intend to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points at our next monetary policy meeting in March and we will then evaluate the subsequent path of our monetary policy. Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and will also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. Moreover, from the beginning of March 2023, the APP portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and determined meeting by meeting. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term target."
Egypt,2023-02-02,"Press Release  February 2nd, 2023 MPC decided to keep key policy rates unchanged In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 1625 percent, 1725 percent, and 1675 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1675 percen. On the global front, forecasts for international commodity prices have marginally tightened compared to those underlying the previous MPC meetin. On the other hand, financial conditions continued to ease for the US economy while the euro area's financial conditions broadly stabilized, compared to available information at the time of the previous MPC meetin. Nonetheless the outlook for international commodity prices remains uncertain, as several factors contribute to upside and downside pressure. Notable factors include the expected global economic slowdown, the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions in China, and the Russia-Ukraine conflic. Domestically economic activity has picked up slightly in 2022 Q3, registering 44 percent compared to 33 percent in 2022 Q2. Real GDP growth was primarily driven by the improvement in tourism, agriculture and trad. Additionally most leading indicators continued to register positive growth rates in 2022 Q4, albeit at a slower pac. Going forward, real GDP growth is expected to moderate in the fiscal year 2022/23 compared to the previous fiscal year, before picking up thereafte. Meanwhile the unemployment rate recorded 74 percent in 2022 Q3, slightly up from the 72 percent recorded in the previous quarte. Annual urban headline inflation continued to increase recording 213 percent in December 202. Similarly annual core inflation has been following an upward trend registering 244 percent in the same mont. Accordingly the average annual headline inflation recorded 187 percent during 2022 Q4 compared to the preannounced target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points. Such developments reflect the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and supply bottlenecks globally on the elevated levels of international commodity prices, despite having eased recently, the exchange rate fluctuations since March 2022 as well as other demand side pressure. The MPC judges that demand side pressures on inflation continue to be present, as evidenced by developments in real economic activity relative to potential capacity and the impact of recent exchange rate fluctuations, both of which are consistent with higher broad money growth outturn. To counter these inflationary pressures, the MPC delivered front loaded policy rate hikes of 800 bps in the previous year, of which 500 bps were in 2022 Q4 alon. In addition, the MPC decided to increase the required reserve ratio by 400 bps in September 202. The pre-emptive tightening policy response aims to anchor inflation expectations at the upcoming inflation target of 7 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2024 Q. As the future path of inflation is a function of the cumulative tightening in the monetary policy stance to date and the lag with which monetary policy tools operate, the MPC decided to maintain key policy rates unchanged in today's meeting in order to assess the impact of the implemented front-loaded tightening policies in a data-driven manne. The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of forecasted inflation rather than prevailing inflation rates and notes that maintaining tight monetary conditions proves to be a necessary condition to achieve the CBE's upcoming inflation targets and price stability over the medium ter.

Armenia,2023-02-05,"PRESS RELEASE 02.05.2023 Refinancing Rate Set at 10.75% At the May 2, 2023 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at 10.75%. In March 2023, the 12-month inflation decreased sharply to 5.4% at the end of the month. The 12-month core inflation has also decreased considerably, reaching 6.4%. In the first quarter of 2023, slow economic growth rates around the world and in the main partner countries of Armenia persisted. The problems in the US banking system are not expected to be systemic in nature and will not have significant macroeconomic effects. The 12-month inflation continues to decrease in Armenia's partner countries, yet the overall inflation environment remains elevated due to sustained high demand and the pressures from the labor market. The central banks of partner countries will, therefore, continue to tighten monetary conditions in the near future. Tight international financial conditions are contributing to lower prices in commodity markets. As a result, the inflationary effects of the global economy on the Armenian economy continue weakening. Strong economic activity in Armenia persisted in early 2023, which was driven by services and construction sectors. Aggregate demand remains high amid continued large inflows of capital and labor, strong recovery of tourism, and increased income in the Armenian economy. Contractionary monetary policy, appreciation of the dram and weakened inflationary effects from the external sector resulted in the decreasing 12-month inflation in Armenia. However, strong demand and inflation expectations are still contributing to high inflation of wages and of certain product groups and services. The Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the policy rate unchanged. The Board will be committed to stabilize demand and inflation expectations. According to the outlined monetary policy scenario, the 12-month inflation will decrease rapidly below the target in the near term and will stabilize around the 4% target in the medium term. The Board of the Central Bank of Armenia estimates that the risks of inflation deviation from the projected path are mostly balanced; in the event these risks materialize in any direction, the Board stands ready to respond accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective. Detailed information underlying the setting of interest rate can be found in the Press Release (Minutes on the Interest Rate) to be published by May 17, 2023."
India,2023-02-08,"Monetary Policy Statement, 2022-23 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) February 6-8, 2023 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (February 8, 2023) decided to: Increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 6.50 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 6.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.75 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. The outlook on global growth has improved in recent months, despite the persistence of geopolitical hostilities and the impact of monetary policy tightening by central banks across the world. Nonetheless, global growth is expected to decelerate during 2023. Inflation is exhibiting some softening from elevated levels, prompting central banks to moderate the size and pace of rate actions. However, central banks are reiterating their commitment to bring down inflation close to their targets. Bond yields remain volatile. The US dollar has come off its recent peak, and equity markets have moved higher since the last MPC meeting. Weak external demand in major advanced economies (AEs), the rising incidence of protectionist policies, volatile capital flows and debt distress could, however, weigh adversely on prospects for emerging market economies (EMEs). Domestic Economy 3. The first advance estimates (FAE) released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on January 6, 2023, placed India's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 7.0 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) for 2022-23, driven by private consumption and investment. On the supply side, gross value added (GVA) was estimated at 6.7 per cent.2 4. High frequency indicators suggest that economic activity has remained strong in Q3 and Q4:2022-23. Rabi acreage exceeded last year's area by 3.3 per cent as on February 3, 2023. Industrial production expanded by 7.1 per cent in November, after contracting by 4.2 per cent in October. Capacity utilisation in manufacturing is now above its long period average. Port freight traffic, e-way bills and toll collections were buoyant in December. Purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) for manufacturing as well as services remained in expansion in January, despite some moderation compared to the previous month. Domestic demand has been sustained by strong discretionary spending. Urban demand exhibited resilience as reflected in healthy passenger vehicle sales and domestic air passenger traffic. Rural demand is improving. Investment activity is gradually gaining ground. Non-oil non-gold imports expanded in December. Merchandise exports, on the other hand, contracted in December on weak global demand. CPI headline inflation moderated to 5.7 per cent (y-o-y) in December 2022  after easing to 5.9 per cent in November  on the back of double digit deflation in vegetable prices. On the other hand, inflationary pressures accentuated across cereals, protein- based food items and spices. Fuel inflation edged up primarily from an uptick in kerosene prices. Core CPI (i.e. CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation rose to 6.1 per cent in December due to sustained price pressures in health, education and personal care and effects. The overall liquidity remains in surplus, with average daily absorption under the LAF increasing to ₹1.6 lakh crore during December-January from an average of ₹1.4 lakh crore in October-November. On a y-o-y basis, money supply (M3) expanded by 9.8 per cent as on January 27, 2023, while non-food bank credit rose by 16.7 per cent. India's foreign exchange reserves were placed at US$ 576.8 billion as on January 27, 2023. Outlook 8. The outlook for inflation is mixed. While prospects for the rabi crop have improved, especially for wheat and oilseeds, risks from adverse weather events remain. The global commodity price outlook, including crude oil, is subject to uncertainties on demand prospects as well as from risks of supply disruptions due to geopolitical tensions. Commodity prices are expected to face upward pressures with the easing of COVID- related mobility restrictions in some parts of the world. The ongoing pass-through of input costs to output prices, especially in services, could continue to exert pressures on core inflation. The Reserve Bank's enterprise surveys point to some softening of input cost and output price pressures in manufacturing. Taking into account these factors and assuming an average crude oil price (Indian basket) of US$ 95 per barrel, inflation is projected at 6.5 per cent in 2022-23, with Q4 at 5.7 per cent. On the assumption of a normal monsoon. CPI inflation is projected at 5.3 per cent for 2023-24, with Q1 at 5.0 per cent. Q2 at 5.4 per cent. Q3 at 5.4 per cent and Q4 at 5.6 per cent, and risks evenly balanced (Chart 1). The stronger prospects for agricultural and allied activities are likely to boost rural demand. The rebound in contact-intensive sectors and discretionary spending is expected to support urban consumption. Businesses and consumers surveyed by the Reserve Bank are optimistic about the outlook. Strong credit growth, resilient financial markets, and the government's continued thrust on capital spending and infrastructure create a congenial environment for investment. On the other hand, external demand is likely to be dented by a slowdown in global activity, with adverse implications for exports.3 Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2023-24 is projected at 6.4 per cent with Q1 at 7.8 per cent. Q2 at 6.2 per cent. Q3 at 6.0 per cent and Q4 at 5.8 per cent, and risks broadly balanced (Chart 2). The easing of inflation in the last two months was driven by strong deflation in vegetables, which may dissipate with the summer season uptick. Headline inflation excluding vegetables has been rising well above the upper tolerance band and may remain elevated, especially with high core inflation pressures. Inflation, therefore, remains a major risk to the outlook. Domestic economic activity is expected to remain resilient aided by the sustained focus on capital and infrastructure spending in the Union Budget 2023-24, even as continuing fiscal consolidation creates space for private investment. While the policy repo rate increases undertaken since May 2022 are working their way through the system, it is imperative to remain alert on inflation so as to ensure that it remains within the tolerance band and progressively aligns with the target. On balance, the MPC is of the view that further calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to keep inflation expectations anchored, break core inflation persistence and thereby strengthen medium-term growth prospects. Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.50 per cent. Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Rajiv Ranjan. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to increase the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. Dr.Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted against the repo rate hike. Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Rajiv Ranjan. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. Jayanth R. Varma voted against this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published on February 22, 2023. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during April 3, 5 and 6, 2023. (Yogesh Dayal) Press Release: 2022-2023/1680 Chief General Manager."
Poland,2023-02-08,"Warsaw, 8 February 2023 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 7-8 February 2023 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ▪ reference rate at 6.75%; ▪ lombard rate at 7.25%; ▪ deposit rate at 6.25%; ▪ rediscount rate at 6.80%; ▪ discount rate at 6.85%. In 2022 Q4 the annual GDP growth in major economies declined. In particular, the euro area saw a further lowering of growth in activity. Although business condition indicators in this economy have slightly improved lately, forecasts still foresee a significant slowdown in euro area GDP growth in 2023. Activity in the global economy and its prospects continue to be negatively affected by the impact of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine, including high energy prices, as well as by the tightening of monetary policy around the world. There persists uncertainty regarding further impact of these shocks on global economic conditions. Inflation in many economies has recently declined, although it remains high. High price dynamics is strongly influenced by high energy prices, protracted effects of the earlier supply shocks, including shocks at commodity markets, as well as demand factors and increasing labour costs. Under such conditions, core inflation in most countries likewise remains high. However, in recent months, prices of some commodities have declined. At the same time, supply chain disruptions are visibly mitigated compared to the first half of 2022. As a result, price pressures are diminishing, which translates into lower growth in producer prices in many countries. The Federal Reserve of the United States and the European Central Bank raised again their interest rates in February 2023. In turn, some central banks of emerging economies, including those in the Central-Eastern Europe region  after earlier significant monetary policy tightening  have kept interest rates unchanged. In Poland, incoming data confirm a slowdown in economic activity. According to Statistics Poland preliminary estimate. GDP growth in 2022 declined to 4.9% y/y, which implies that 1/2 in 2022 Q4 the annual GDP growth most likely decreased once again. Despite the decelerating GDP growth, labour market situation remains good, which is reflected i.a. in a low unemployment rate. At the same time, data on the corporate sector show that nominal annual growth in average wages in December 2022 slowed down compared to the previous month. Inflation in Poland in December 2022 decreased to 16.6% y/y. The decrease in CPI in year- on-year terms compared to November was mainly driven by lower growth in prices of energy carriers and fuels, due to a decline in prices of coal and oil. In 2022, as a whole, both CPI inflation as well as core inflation were running at high levels. Amid rising demand, a significant increase in costs  resulting from a strong surge in commodity prices and disruptions in global value chains  was passed through to consumer prices. In turn, the so-called Anti-inflationary Shield continued to limit dynamics in consumer prices in 2022. In final months of 2022, commodity prices and producer price growth declined, and disruptions in global value chains were markedly less acute than earlier, which together with the expected economic slowdown, will support a gradual easing of consumer price dynamics. The Council assessed, that the weakening of the external economic conditions, together with monetary policy tightening by major central banks, will curb global inflation and commodity prices. The deterioration of the global economic conditions also hampers GDP growth in Poland. Under such circumstances, the hitherto significant monetary policy tightening by NBP will support a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target. At the same time, given strength and persistence of the recent shocks that remain beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, in the short term inflation will remain high, and its return to the NBP inflation target will be gradual. A decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council's assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy. Further decisions of the Council will depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity, including the impact of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine on the Polish economy. NBP will take all necessary actions in order to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability, including above all to reduce the risk of inflation remaining elevated. NBP may intervene in the foreign exchange market, in particular to limit fluctuations of the zloty exchange rate that are inconsistent with the direction of monetary policy."
Mexico,2023-02-09,"World economic growth moderated during the fourth quarter of 2022. The outlook for 2023 continues implying a deceleration. Global inflation remains high, although headline inflation decreased in a large number of economies due to lower pressures on energy prices. In several cases, the core component still does not show a downward inflection. Most central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, continued raising their reference rates and announced that they will remain high for an extended period. Among key global risks are those associated with the pandemic, the persistence of inflationary pressures, the intensification of geopolitical turmoil, and tighter monetary and financial conditions. Since the previous monetary policy decision, the Mexican peso has appreciated. Short-term interest rates increased while medium- and long-term ones decreased. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Mexican economy continued growing, although it lost momentum as compared to previous quarters. In January, headline inflation increased to a level of 7.91%. Core inflation, which reflects inflation's trend more accurately, surprised to the upside, reaching 8.45%. This was due to a slower-than-anticipated decrease in food merchandise inflation and a rebound in that of services. Inflation expectations for 2023 and 2024 were revised again upwards, while those for longer terms were adjusted slightly downwards, although they remain above target. In view of a slower-than-foreseen disinflationary process, forecasts for headline and core inflation were revised upwards for the entire horizon. Inflation is projected to converge to the 3% target in the fourth quarter of 2024 (see Table). These projections are subject to risks. On the upside: persistence of core inflation at high levels; pressures on energy prices or on agricultural and livestock product prices; the Chinese economy's reopening; exchange rate depreciation; and greater cost-related pressures. On the downside: a greater-than-anticipated slowdown of the world economy; a decline in the intensity of the geopolitical conflict; a better functioning of supply chains; a lower pass-through effect from some cost-related pressures; and a larger-than-anticipated effect from the Federal Government's measures to fight elevated prices. The balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon remains biased to the upside. The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the inflationary shocks and its determinants, along with the evolution of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process. It considered the challenges stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of uncertainty, the persistence of accumulated inflationary pressures and the possibility of greater effects on inflation, as well as the monetary policy stance already attained in this hiking cycle. In particular, it deemed that, given the dynamics of core inflation, on this occasion it is necessary to continue with the magnitude of the reference rate adjustment of the previous policy meeting, 1 in order to be in a better position to tackle a still complex inflation environment. Based on the above, and with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 11.00%. With this action, the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon. The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations. The latter, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times with both the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets. The Board considers that, given the monetary policy stance already attained and depending on the evolution of incoming data, for its next policy meeting, the upward adjustment to the reference rate could be of lower magnitude. 2/ Forecast starting December 2022.

Peru,2023-02-09,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT FEBRUARY 2023 BCRP MAINTAINED THE REFERENCE RATE AT 7.75% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain the reference rate at 7.75 percent. This pause does not necessarily imply an end to the BCRP's monetary tightening cycle. Future reference rate adjustments will be conditional on new information about inflation and its determinants, including the macroeconomic effects of the recent political unrest. In January, month-on-month inflation was 0.23 percent and core inflation was 0.05 percent. Year-on-year inflation increased from 8.46 percent in December to 8.66 percent in January, due to higher prices for locally produced food, while core inflation increased from 5.59 percent in December to 5.80 percent in January, both above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The significant increase in international food and fuel prices since the second half of 2021, accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in global inflation in magnitudes not seen in many years and towards levels significantly higher than the inflation targets of central banks, both in advanced and other economies in the region. In the case of domestic inflation, it has been exacerbated by the political unrest since December. A downward trend in year-on-year inflation is forecast since March, with a return to the target range in the fourth quarter of this year, due to a moderation of the impact of international food and fuel prices, a reversal of agricultural supply shocks, and declining inflation expectations in the rest of the year. One-year-ahead expected inflation increased from 4.30 percent in December to 4.62 percent in January, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most leading and expectations indicators for economic activity deteriorated in January, and remain in pessimistic territory. The outlook for global economic activity has improved slightly; however, global risks remain due to monetary tightening in advanced economies, the impact of inflation on consumption, and international conflicts. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants, including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, to consider, if necessary, changes in the monetary stance. The Board reaffirms its commitment to adopt the necessary actions to ensure the return of inflation to the target range over the forecast horizon. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 5.25 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 8.25 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months and the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months. In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates based on the amount of the operations. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on March 9, 2023."
Romania,2023-02-09,"In its meeting of 9 February 2023, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual inflation rate went down to 16.37 percent in December 2022 from 16.76 percent in November, remaining only marginally above the forecast, mainly as a result of lower fuel prices amid the decline in oil prices and the appreciation of the leu against the US dollar. Consequently, in 2022 Q4, the annual inflation rate reached a plateau, in line with expectations, posting a much more subdued rise over the period than in the previous quarters (from 15.88 percent in September), given the stronger disinflationary impact from the aggregate dynamics of the exogenous CPI components, following the notable decline in fuel prices. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate saw a renewed, slight acceleration over the last months of 2022, contrary to forecasts, rising from 11.9 percent in September to 14.6 percent in December 2022, against the background of the continued advance in processed food prices, but also of almost across-the-board price increases in non-food and services segments. The evolution of adjusted CORE2 inflation continues to reflect the effects of large hikes in agri-food commodity prices and energy and transport costs, alongside the influences of bottlenecks in production chains. These were compounded, during this period too, by high short-term inflation expectations and the resilience of demand in certain segments, as well as by the significant share of food items and imported goods in the CPI basket. The annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP  inflation indicator for EU Member States) moved up to 14.1 percent in December 2022 from 13.4 percent in September. Furthermore, the average annual CPI inflation rate and the average HICP inflation rate went up to 13.8 percent and 12.0 percent respectively in December 2022 from 11.8 percent and 10.2 percent respectively in September 2022, remaining however below the levels prevailing in the region and the Baltic countries. The new statistical data reconfirm the significantly stronger-than-expected economic growth in 2022 Q3, at a pace similar to that in the previous three months, i.e. 1.2 percent, implying a pick-up in the aggregate demand surplus during this period too. Annual GDP growth continued to decelerate in 2022 Q3  to 3.8 percent from 5.1 percent in Q2 , although remaining significant from a historical perspective, mainly on the back of gross fixed capital formation this time round, way ahead of the contribution from household consumption. By contrast, the contribution of net exports strongly re-entered negative territory in Q3, given that the annual growth rate of imports of goods and services exceeded notably that of exports thereof in terms of volume. Against this background, the growth rate of the trade deficit accelerated considerably versus the same year-earlier period, despite the narrowing of the unfavourable differential between the lower annual change in import prices and that in export prices, whereas the annual dynamics of the current account deficit doubled, inter alia as a result of the strong worsening in the dynamics of the primary income balance. The latest data and analyses point to a gradual slowdown in economic growth in 2022 Q4 and 2023 Q1, under the impact of the protracted war in Ukraine and the extension of the associated sanctions, but also a mild advance in GDP growth in 2022 Q4 compared to the same period of 2021 amid a base effect. Relevant from this perspective is the acceleration seen in October-November 2022 by the growth rate of retail trade and motor vehicles and motorcycles sales, but especially by that of services to households, alongside the further strong step-up in the volume of construction works. In the first two months of 2022 Q4, industrial output saw, however, its contraction in annual terms re-widen, whereas exports of goods and services recorded a considerable drop in their annual change, much more pronounced than that of imports, inter alia in the context of the deteriorating terms of trade, which triggered an acceleration in the annual increase in trade and current account deficits. Yet, the dynamics of the latter reflected also the influences of rising inflows of EU funds to the current account, largely offset however by a worsening of developments in the primary income segment. The number of employees in the economy continued to rise in the first two months of 2022 Q4, yet at a visibly slower pace than in H1, while the ILO unemployment rate climbed again to reach 5.6 percent in December from 5.4 percent in Q3. At the same time, the labour shortage reported by companies remained, in early 2023 too, on the gradual downward trend visible in 2022 H2, while the revival of hiring intentions in January 2023 occurred after the visible drop seen at the end of last year and in the context of mixed sectoral developments. The main interbank money market rates saw their gradual downward adjustment extend into January 2023, amid the excess liquidity in the banking system. Yields on government securities posted new declines  relatively in line with developments in the region , in the context of the marked improvement of investor sentiment towards financial markets in emerging economies, under the influence of expectations on a more moderate tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Against this background, reflecting also an increase in the relative attractiveness of investments in domestic currency, the leu exhibited again a strengthening trend versus the euro starting in mid-January 2023. Moreover, the domestic currency appreciated further against the US dollar following the developments on international financial markets. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector decelerated in December 2022 as well, albeit more moderately, reaching 12.1 percent (13.2 percent in November), amid the slightly slower decline in the dynamics of the leu-denominated component, alongside the steeper uptrend in the rate of change of foreign currency loans. The share of leu-denominated loans in credit to the private sector continued to fall, to 68.8 percent in December 2022 from 69.4 percent in November. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the February 2023 Inflation Report, which incorporates the latest available data and information. According to the updated forecast, the annual inflation rate is expected to fall at a significantly faster-than-previously anticipated pace until mid-2024, especially as of 2023 Q3, amid the extension of energy price capping and compensation schemes until 31 March 2025, concurrently with the changes made to these schemes starting 1 January 2023. Specifically, the annual inflation rate is envisaged to decline to one-digit levels starting in 2023 Q3 already  almost three quarters earlier than in the prior forecast  and end the year far below the previously-anticipated value. It is then seen falling at a visibly slower pace in 2024 H2 and remaining slightly above the variation band of the target at the end of the projection horizon. Aside from the new setup of energy price capping schemes, the major drivers behind the prospective decrease in inflation are the increasingly strong disinflationary base effects and the downward corrections of some commodity prices. To these add the influences from the likely contraction and closing of the positive output gap across the forecast horizon, although somewhat slower than in the previous projection, implying that the output gap will enter negative territory only slightly towards end-2024. The war in Ukraine and the related sanctions continue, however, to generate significant uncertainties and to pose risks to the outlook for economic activity, hence to medium-term inflation developments, mainly through the effects exerted on households' and investors' confidence, as well as on their income, but also by affecting the economies of major trading partners and the risk perception towards economies in the region, with an impact on financing costs. Furthermore, the absorption of EU funds, especially those under the Next Generation EU programme, is conditional on fulfilling strict milestones and targets for implementing the projects. However, it is essential for carrying out the necessary structural reforms, energy transition included, as well as for counterbalancing, at least in part, the contractionary impact of supply-side shocks, compounded by the war in Ukraine and by the tightening of economic and financial conditions worldwide. Significant uncertainties and risks are, however, associated with the fiscal policy stance as well, given, on one hand, the public deficit target set for 2023 in order to continue budget consolidation amid the excessive deficit procedure and the hefty increase in financing cost and, on the other hand, the packages of support measures to be implemented or extended this year, in a still challenging economic and social environment domestically and globally, with potential adverse implications for budget parameters. Particularly important at the current juncture are the Fed's and the ECB's monetary policy decisions, as well as the behaviour of central banks in the region, inter alia from the perspective of the constantly evolving interest rate differential and of capital flows. In the meeting held today, 9 February 2023, based on the currently available data and assessments, as well as in light of the very elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 7.00 percent per annum. Moreover, it decided to leave unchanged the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 8.00 percent per annum and the deposit facility rate at 6.00 percent per annum. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to keep the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to bring the annual inflation rate back in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat target on a lasting basis, inter alia by anchoring inflation expectations over the medium term, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. At the current juncture, the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms inter alia by using EU funds to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand adverse developments. The NBR closely monitors developments in the domestic and international environment and will continue to use the tools at its disposal to achieve the fundamental objective of price stability in the medium term. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 15 February 2023 at 11:00 a.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 21 February 2023 at 3:00 p.m. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board will be held on 4 April 2023."
Russia,2023-02-10,"On 10 February 2023, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 7.50% per annum. Current price growth rates are increasing, remaining moderate in terms of sustainable components. Inflation expectations of households and businesses edged down but remain elevated. Economic activity trends evolve better than the Bank of Russia's October forecast. Although households' consumer behaviour is still cautious, there appear signs of recovery in consumer activity. Accelerating fiscal spending, deteriorating terms of foreign trade and situation in the labour market intensify pro-inflation risks. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. If pro-inflation risks intensify, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of key rate increase at its upcoming meetings. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will come in at 5.07.0% in 2023 to return to 4% in 2024. Inflation movements. As of 6 February, annual inflation is 11.8% after 11.9% in December 2022. Current price growth rates are increasing, having accelerated since the beginning of 2023. Higher inflationary pressures are in part due to volatile components, especially fruit and vegetable prices, and also the weakening of the ruble in late 2022. In terms of stable components, however, the current price growth rates remain moderate. Inflation expectations of households and price expectations of enterprises edged down but remain elevated. At the same time, business price expectations declined in January for the first time after several months of growth. Analysts' inflation expectations for 2023 have increased slightly, but are anchored close to 4% for the medium term. The Bank of Russia forecasts that in the coming months, annual inflation will temporarily fall below 4% under the influence of last year's high base effect. At the same time, the sustainable inflationary pressure will gradually increase from moderately low levels. According to the baseline scenario, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will come in at 5.07.0% in 2023, return to 4% in 2024 and will be close to 4% further on. Monetary conditions remained broadly neutral. Since the previous key rate review meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors OFZ yields have risen and the slope of the OFZ curve has increased. This largely points to the expansion of the government borrowing programme. At the same time, credit and deposit rates have remained almost unchanged. Credit activity has been high overall, especially in the mortgage and corporate sectors. Households' and businesses' funds in current accounts and bank deposits have increased. At the end of 2022, an increase in budget expenditures made a significant contribution to the growth of current accounts. Overall, despite higher inflation expectations and a certain improvement in consumer sentiment, households remain cautious in their consumer behaviour. This is reflected in the high propensity to save and the increased share of liquid assets (current accounts and ruble cash) in the savings structure. Economic activity. As estimated by the Bank of Russia, 2022 GDP decreased by 2.5%. In late 2022 and early 2023, flash data suggest that business and consumer activity trends, as well as those of foreign trade, are evolving better than forecast by the Bank of Russia in October. At the same time, at present, the capacity to expand production in the Russian economy is largely limited by the labour market situation. Unemployment continues to be close to its all-time low. Labour shortages are increasing in many industries amid the effects of the partial mobilisation and a general increase in corporate demand for labour force. Under these conditions, labour productivity growth may lag behind real wage growth. During the structural transformation of the economy, the structure of aggregate demand continues to change. Consumer demand remained subdued at the end of 2022, but, from the beginning of 2023, it has been showing signs of recovery amid improving consumer sentiment. The slowdown in private sector investment demand is evolving simultaneously with growing government investment. Accelerating fiscal spending increases the contribution of fiscal policy to the expansion of aggregate demand. Taking into account the ongoing structural transformation of the Russian economy, the Bank of Russia's baseline scenario forecasts the growth of GDP at (-1.0)-(+1.0)% in 2023 and 0.5-2.5% in 2024. Inflation risks. The medium-term balance of risks remains tilted towards pro-inflation risks. Short-term pro-inflation risks have increased again and still prevail over disinflationary risks. A slowdown in the global economy and a further escalation of external trade and financial restrictions may weaken foreign demand for Russian exports and have a pro-inflation effect via exchange rate dynamics. In turn, the negative effect of the existing external restrictions on the Russian economy's potential may prove to be stronger, which is also a significant pro-inflation risk. The Bank of Russia's baseline scenario rests on the decisions already made regarding the mid-term expenditure path of the federal budget and the fiscal system as a whole. In case of a further budget deficit expansion, pro-inflation risks will rise and tighter monetary policy may be required to return inflation to target in 2024 and keep it close to 4% further on. Pro-inflation risks from the labour market persist. Labour shortages in some sectors may lead to the labour productivity growth lagging behind the growth of real wages. High and unanchored inflation expectations, which are particularly sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations, are also a source of risk. Under these conditions, the continuing growth of the most liquid assets in the structure of household savings may spur increased consumer demand in the future. A disinflationary risk for the baseline scenario is the continued high propensity of households to save amid increased general uncertainty, as well as the duration of households' adaptation to a new supply structure in consumer markets. A growing risk premium in bond yields and lending rates may additionally tighten monetary conditions, which will restrain lending in the economy. A more rapid adaptation of the economy, accompanied by an active recovery of imports among other things, may also have a disinflationary effect. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. If pro-inflation risks intensify, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of key rate increase at its upcoming meetings. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors key rate meeting of 10 February 2023 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 17 March 2023. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13.30 Moscow time.

Philippines,2023-02-15,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to raise the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility by 50 basis points to 6.0 percent, effective tomorrow, 17 February 2023. Accordingly, the interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities will be set to 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively. In deciding to raise the policy interest rate anew, the Monetary Board noted that the latest baseline inflation forecast path has shifted higher relative to the previous assessment. Average inflation is projected to breach the upper end of the 2-4 percent target range at 6.1 percent in 2023, before returning to within target at 3.1 percent in 2024. The forecasts were adjusted upwards following the higher-than-expected inflation outturn in January as well as the continued stronger rebound in domestic demand and gross domestic product (GDP) growth in Q4 2022. Both headline and core inflation measures have also continued to increase, indicating a further broadening of price pressures, particularly in services. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have likewise risen further, underscoring the need to preempt the emergence of further second-round effects. At the same time, the balance of risks to inflation now leans toward the upside for both 2023 and 2024, with pressures emanating from the potential impact of global food market uncertainties, continued domestic shortages in key food items, additional transport fare hikes amid elevated oil prices, and the higher-than-expected wage adjustments in 2023. Meanwhile, the impact of a weaker-than-expected global economic recovery remains the primary downside risk to the inflation outlook. The Monetary Board also reiterates its encouragement and support for timely and more aggressive whole-of-government actions to mitigate the impact of persistent supply-side pressures on food prices, including trade positive measures and significant progress to boost productivity. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board deems a strong follow-through monetary policy response as necessary to reduce the risk of a breach in the inflation target in 2024. An upward adjustment in the policy interest rate would also prevent inflation expectations from drifting further away from the target band. The Monetary Board also believes that, with domestic growth exceeding expectations in 2022, monetary action can help to dampen potential demand-side pressures and second-round effects without unduly hindering the sustained momentum of economic growth. The BSP reassures the public that it stands ready to take all necessary policy action to bring inflation to within the 2-4 percent government target over the medium term, in line with its primary mandate of ensuring price stability."
Israel,2023-02-20,"The Monetary Committee decides on February 20, 2023 to increase the interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 4.25 percent. Inflation over the preceding 12 months is above the upper bound of the target, overshoots for a wide range of components, and is 5.4 percent. Inflation expectations for all terms are within the target range. GDP grew in 2022 by an accelerated rate of 6.5 percent, and for the last 5 quarters its level has been above the pre-crisis trend line. GDP growthin the fourth quarter was impacted, to a large extent, by a transitory sharp increase in vehicle purchases at the end of 2022. Economic activity continues to be robust. The labor market remains tight and is around full employment, but in recent months there has been some moderation in various employment data. The scope of housing market activity is moderating. Home prices continued to increase, but for several months already at a more moderate pace. The number of home purchase transactions and the volume of mortgages taken out continue to decline. Rents continued their upward trend. Since the previous policy decision, exchange rates have been characterized by considerable volatility: in the beginning of the intermeeting period the shekel strengthened, and later on the trend changed and the shekel depreciated by approximately 5 percent in the last month. Growth forecasts worldwide were revised upward, but the growth rate in major economies continues to be moderate. The inflation environment continues to be high, but it can be seen that there is moderation in the headline inflation rate in many countries, but the moderation in core inflation is slower. The Israeli economy is recording strong economic activity, accompanied by a tight labor market and an increase in the inflation environment. The Committee has therefore decided to continue the process of increasing the interest rate. The pace of raising the interest rate will be determined in accordance with activity data and the development of inflation, in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy goals. The robust activity in Israel's economy continues. The labor market remains tight and around full employment, although the most recent data indicate some moderation. The inflation rate is above the target and encompasses a wide range of components. Tighter monetary policy and the moderation in activity worldwide are expected to lead to some slowing in economic activity in Israel as well, alongside a slowdown in the inflation rate. Since the previous policy decision, the CPI increased by 0.3 percent in each of the months December 2022 and January 2023. Inflation in the past 12 months is above the upper bound of the target range, at 5.4 percent (Figure 1). However, the inflation rate in Israel is lower than in most advanced economies (Figure 37). Net of energy and fruit and vegetables, inflation is 5.1 percent, as is the inflation rate after further netting out the effects of taxation and regulation (Figure 2). The pace of increase in the nontradable components in the CPI is 5.5 percent, and the growth rate of the tradable components in the CPI is 5.4 percent (Figure 3). One-year inflation expectations and forecasts from all sources increased, but are within the target range, in its upper part (Figure 6). Inflation expectations derived from the capital market for the second year and onward are also within the target range (Figure 7). The Committee assesses that the monetary tightening policies in Israel and worldwide, and the moderation of demand, act to moderate inflation. The extent of fiscal expansion and the development of wages will have an impact on the inflation rate's convergence to its target. According to the initial estimate of National Accounts data. GDP grew in 2022 by 6.5 percent, and for 5 quarters its level has been above the pre-crisis trend line (Figure 17). GDP per capita grew in 2022 by 4.4 percent. This growth is one of the highest rates among OECD countries. In the fourth quarter of 2022. GDP grew, compared to the third quarter of that year, by 5.8 percent in annual terms. The above-forecast growth derived from an increase in private consumption, public consumption, investments, and from a decline in imports. In contrast, there was a marked decline in goods exports and services exports, which are still at high levels (Figure 18). This is reflected as well in similar trends in monthly foreign trade data (Figure 22-23). GDP growth this quarter was impacted, to a large extent, by a transitory sharp rise invehicle purchases at the end of 2022, which contributed approximately half of the fourth quarter growth. A year over year comparison of the fourth quarter of 2022 with the fourth quarter of the year before shows a lower growth rate, of approximately 2.7 percent. Economic activity remains robust, but there are signs in the most recent data of some slowing in the growth rate. The aggregate balance of the Business Tendency Survey, conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics, for January continues to indicate businesses' positive assessments regarding their situation, but to a smaller extent relative to most months of 2022 (Figure 19). Credit card expenditure data remain in the environment of the long-term trend (Figure 21). The easing in the equipment and raw materials constraint reported by companies in the manufacturing and construction industries continues, due to the moderation in supply chain pressures. The level of the equipment and raw materials constraint in the manufacturing industry continues to decline but remains slightly higher than just before the COVID-19 crisis (Figure 25). The labor market remains tight, but in recent months there has been somemoderation in the various employment data. The employment rate for ages 15+ (61.1 percent in January 2023) is currently at a similar level to its pre-crisis level. Despite some decline, the employment rate among the prime working ages (25-64, 78.2 percent in December 2022), remains higher than its pre-crisis level. The unemployment rates among ages 15+ (4.3 percent. January 2023) and among the prime working ages (3.7 percent. December data) are relatively low, but they increased compared to the low level in June 2022 (Figures 26-27). In parallel, the job vacancy rate, which reflects demand for workers, declined moderately in most of the previous months. Despite this decline, in January it remains at a high level (Figure 28). Based on the Business Tendency Survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics, in January there was some increase in businesses' expectations of expanding their workforce (Figure 20). The real wage per employee post declined slightly but remains near the trend line (Figure 29). Home prices increased in the past 12 months by 17.1 percent (Figure 12), a high pace compared to that of recent years, but the most recent data show moderation in the rate of growth. The decline in the scope of transactions and in mortgage volume continues; in January a total of NIS 6.4 billion in mortgages was taken out, about half the amount recorded a year ago (Figure 13). Rent prices increased by 0.7 percent in January. The housing component in the January CPI continued increasing, at 6.6 percent in the past year. In the domestic capital market, equity indices are at a level similar tothat of the beginning of the year, reflecting underperformance compared with equity indices worldwide. Long-term government bond yields are at a similar level to that in the beginning of the reviewed period. Corporate bond yield spreads were stable (Figure 14). According to the Business Tendency Survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics, the difficulty in obtaining credit of various businesses continues to be at a relatively low level (Figure 15). In the reviewed period, the shekel weakened by 1 percent against the dollar, by 2 percent against the euro, and by 1.3 percent in nominal effective exchange rate terms (Figure 8). Exchange rates were characterized by considerable volatility in this period: in the beginning the shekel strengthened, and subsequently the trend changed and the shekel depreciated by about 5 percent in the past month. Worldwide, growth forecasts in the period reviewed were revised upward as a result of a decline in concerns of an energy crisis in Europe. China's reopening after lifting the COVID-19 limitations, and better than expected data on activity in the US. These developments increase the probability of a 'soft landing' worldwide. However, the growth rate in major economies remains moderate. The IMF and investment houses revised their growth forecasts upward for the various blocs (Figure 30), after a prolonged period of downward revisions in forecasts. Purchasing Managers Indices in advanced and emerging economies increased, with the index for emerging economies in the environment indicating economic expansion, but for advanced economies still indicating a slowing in the pace ofactivity (Figure 31). The easing in supply chains continues, with a decline in shipping prices worldwide. World trade data for November 2022 indicated a sharp decline against the background of the outbreak of COVID-19 that occurred then in China. In addition, the component of orders for exports in the Purchasing Managers Index, which serves as a leading index for world trade volume, indicates that in January as well the scope ofworld trade activity remained relatively low. Prices rose on major equity indices worldwide (Figure 39). For long-term government bond yields the trend was mixed, with a slight increase in yields in the US and Germany. Oil prices remained essentially unchanged. The inflation environment worldwide remains high but there is a trend ofmoderation in many countries. With that, in core indices the trend is mixed (Figure 34). Interest rate increases continue worldwide but the pace is moderating. In the US, fourth quarter 2022 growth was 2.9 percent, above analysts' forecasts. The CPI declined in January to 6.4 percent, a moderate decline relative to analysts' forecasts. The US Federal Reserve continued to slow the pace of interest rate increases and increased the interest rate in its most recent meeting by 25 basis points. In the eurozone, inflation moderated to a rate of 8.5 percent in January, a sharper decline than analysts' forecasts, but core inflation continued to increase. The ECB increased the interest rate by 50 basis pointsand the ECB Governor assessed that in March the interest rate would be increased by an additional 50 basis points. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on March 6, 2023. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. April 3, 2023, followed by a press briefing with the."
South Korea,2023-02-23,"The bank of korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.50% for the intermeeting period. It is forecast that inflation will continue to be above the target level throughout the year although it is projected to gradually decrease, and uncertainties surrounding the policy decision are also judged to be high. The Board, therefore, sees that it is appropriate to judge whether the Base Rate needs to rise further while assessing the pace of inflation slowdown and developments in the uncertainties. Currently available information suggests that the slowdown of global economic growth and inflation has continued. However, concerns about a recession in major countries have somewhat decreased due to the easing of concerns over energy supply and demand, as well as labor market conditions continuing to be favorable, and the pace of inflation slowdown in the U.S, has been modest. In global financial markets, volatility in major price variables has increased. The U.S, dollar has shifted to a rapid strengthening after continuing to weaken, and long-term market interest rates have rebounded considerably, led by expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve's terminal rate will be higher than previously expected after the announcement of U.S, labor market and price indicators exceeding market expectations. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the pace of global inflation slowdown, monetary policy changes in major countries and U.S, dollar trends, the recovery in the Chinese economy after the easing of its COVID-19 restrictions, and geopolitical risks. Although concerns about a recession in major countries have eased, domestic economic growth has continued to slow, with the recovery in private consumption weakening and exports continuing to decrease due to deepened sluggishness in the IT industry. Labor market conditions have generally continued to be favorable, but the decline in the increase in the number of persons employed has continued due to the economic slowdown. Going forward, domestic economic growth is expected to remain weak, affected by the global economic slowdown and the increase in interest rates. Domestic economic growth is expected to improve gradually from the second half of this year with a recovery in the Chinese economy and in the IT industry. However, uncertainties regarding the outlook are judged to be high. GDP growth for this year is projected to be 1.6%, slightly lower than the November forecast of 1.7%. Consumer price inflation has run at 5.2% in January, which has been higher than the 5.0% in December, due to increases in electricity fees as well as rising prices of processed food products, although increases in the price of petroleum products have moderated. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has run at 4.1% in January. Short-term inflation expectations among the general public have run at 4.0% in February. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain around 5% in February, but will gradually decrease owing to the base effect from the sharp rises in global oil prices last year and weakening pressure from the demand side. However, the pace of slowdown is expected to be more modest than in major countries due to the effects of the increases in public utility fees. Consumer price inflation for this year is projected to be 3.5%, slightly lower than the November forecast of 3.6%. Uncertainty surrounding inflation forecasts is judged to be high, regarding movements of global oil prices and exchange rates, the degree of economic slowdown at home and abroad, and the size and effects of the increases in public utility fees. In financial and foreign exchange markets, volatility has increased in February with a considerable rebound in the Korean won to U.S, dollar exchange rate and in market interest rates, which have shown a decrease since last November due to the possibility of further tightening of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy stance. The decrease in household loans has widened, and housing prices have continued to decline across all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over the medium-term horizon as it monitors economic growth, while paying attention to financial stability. Inflation is projected to remain high above the target level although the domestic economic growth rate has slowed, and uncertainties surrounding the policy decision are high. The Board, therefore, deems it warranted to judge whether the Base Rate needs to rise further while maintaining the restrictive policy stance for a considerable time with an emphasis on ensuring price stability. In this process the Board will thoroughly assess the pace of inflation slowdown, the economic downside risks and financial stability risks, the effects of the Base Rate raises, and monetary policy changes in major countries. Opening Remarks to the Press Conference (February 23, 2023). Today, the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) of the Bank of Korea decided to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.50%. I will first go over financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and then explain the background to today's Base Rate decision in detail. First, looking at the changes in external conditions since the January MPB meeting, the global economy has seen growth and inflation slow, but the pace of the slowdown has moderated more than initially expected. In the U.S, and the euro area which had high concerns for a recession, expectations for a soft landing have heightened as favorable labor market conditions have continued and concerns over energy supply and demand have eased due to warm winter weather. In China, the recovery of economic activity has been more rapid than expected since the easing of COVID restriction policies. Inflation in major countries has declined gradually from the high levels, but the pace of decline has been slow, with U.S, consumer price inflation for January recording 6.4%, only a 0.1%p drop from the 6.5% in December. As for global financial markets, volatility of major price variables has heightened as uncertainties over the U.S. Federal Reserve's terminal rate have increased. The U.S, dollar, which had weakened affected by the Federal Reserve's adjustment of the pace of rate hikes, shifted to a substantial and rapid strengthening in February as U.S, labor and inflation indicators exceeded market expectations. Long-term market interest rates in major countries, which had continued a declining trend, have risen considerably since February. As consumer price inflation in Japan has risen recently, uncertainties regarding the monetary policy by the Bank of Japan as well as the Federal Reserve have also increased. The Korean economy has continued to slow. Although the global economy slowed by less than expected, exports continued to decline due to deepened sluggishness in the IT industry and recovery in private consumption weakened, affected by high inflation and the increase in interest rates. Concerning inflation, consumer price inflation rose to 5.2% in January from 5.0% in the previous month. This is largely because electricity fees increased, and the prices of processed food products and other items maintained high upward trends, although increases in petroleum product prices have moderated. Core inflation recorded 4.1% in January and short-term inflation expectations stood at 4.0% in February. Volatility has heightened in domestic financial and foreign exchange markets. Market interest rates have rebounded from an earlier significant decline affected by movements in Treasury bond yields in major countries. The Korean won to U.S, dollar exchange rate had dropped to the lower-1,200 won range, but has recently increased to around 1,300 won, in line with the shift to U.S, dollar strengthening. Looking at household debt and the housing market, housing sales prices in both the Seoul metropolitan area and in other regions have continued to decrease. Household loans have declined significantly, led by increases in interest rates and the sluggishness in the housing market. The Board has revisited its review of future inflation and growth trends, reflecting changes in internal and external conditions since the November MPB meeting. First. GDP growth for this year is projected to be 1.6%, which is slightly below the November forecast of 1.7%. This projection comprehensively reflects both the upward adjustment factors (+0.2%p), such as the possibility of a soft landing in the United States and in Europe, and the downward adjustment factors (-0.3%p), including the sluggishness in the IT industry and domestic real estate market. The economy is expected to improve gradually going into the second half of this year. However, there are still high uncertainties related to monetary policies in major economies, the recovery in the Chinese economy, and the domestic real estate market. Consumer price inflation is expected to be around 5% in February and drop significantly in March, owing chiefly to the base effect of a surge in global oil prices last year. It will continue its downward trend to hit the lower-3% range at the end of this year mainly affected by the weakening of demand-side pressure. As a result, annual inflation is projected to reach 3.5%, slightly below the November forecast of 3.6%. Compared to major economies, the level of inflation in Korea will likely be lower, while the pace of slowdown is expected to be more moderate, due to the effects of the increases in public utility fees. Concerning this inflation forecast, uncertainties remain high regarding movements of global oil prices and the exchange rate, the degree of economic slowdown at home and abroad, and the effects of the increases in public utility fees. The Board decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.50%. It is forecast that inflation will continue running above the target level throughout the year although it is projected to gradually decrease. Also, uncertainties surrounding policy decisions are high. The Board therefore judged that, while leaving the rate unchanged at the current level, it is appropriate to closely monitor developments of several uncertainty factors. They include ① the pace of inflation slowdown, ② the U.S. Federal Reserve's terminal rate, ③ the effects of China's economic recovery on the domestic economy, ④ the effects of a sluggish domestic real estate market on financial stability, and ⑤ the effects of accumulated Base Rate hikes. One members―Cho Yoon-Je―voted against the decision to leave the Base Rate unchanged, proposing to raise it by 25 basis points. Looking ahead, the Board will judge whether the Base Rate needs to rise further while maintaining its restrictive policy stance for a considerable time. This is attributable to the fact that inflation throughout the year is expected to run above the target level, even if the trend of inflation going forward is consistent with the current forecast. In this process, the Board will operate monetary policy in a sophisticated manner while thoroughly assessing developments of the abovementioned uncertainties and their effects. Finally. I would like to emphasize once again that, against a backdrop of greater uncertainty than ever, the decision to leave the Base Rate unchanged at today's meeting was taken, after having raised it at every MPB meeting since last April. Also. I don't want today's decision to be seen as the end of the rate hikes. Although the Board raised the Base Rate at every meeting due to exceptionally high inflation last year, previously it was ordinary to pause after raising the rate to examine the need for further increases. Today's decision could be understood as returning to this usual way in the past."
Turkiye,2023-02-23,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 9 percent to 8.5 percent. Although recently released data point to a stronger economic activity than anticipated, recession concerns in developed economies as a result of ongoing geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes continue. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the high level in producer and consumer inflation continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. The divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue to increase due to their diverse economic outlook. It is observed that central banks continue their efforts to develop new supportive measures and tools to cope with the increasing uncertainties in financial markets. Additionally, financial markets have been adjusting their expectations that the central banks would end the rate hike cycles in the near term on the back of the recession risks. Before the worst natural disaster of the last century, leading indicators have been pointing to a stronger domestic demand compared to foreign demand as well as an increase in the growth trend in the first quarter of 2023. The impact of the earthquake on production, consumption, employment and expectations is being extensively evaluated. While the earthquake is expected to affect economic activity in the near term, it is anticipated that it will not have a permanent impact on performance of the Turkish economy in the medium term. While share of sustainable components of economic growth increases, the stronger than expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues throughout the year. On the other hand, domestic consumption demand, high level of energy prices and the weak economic activity in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. As announced in the 2023 Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy document, the Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and the entire policy toolset, particularly funding channels, will be aligned with liraization targets. The Committee will prioritize the creation of supportive financial conditions in order to minimize the effects of the disaster and support the necessary recovery. While level and underlying trend of inflation have been improved with the support of the implemented integrated policy approach, the effect of earthquake driven supply-demand imbalances on inflation is closely monitored. It has become even more important to keep financial conditions supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment after the earthquake. Accordingly, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 50 basis. The Committee assessed that the current monetary policy stance after the measured reduction is adequate to support the necessary recovery in the aftermath of the earthquake by maintaining price stability and financial stability. The effects of the earthquake in the first half of 2023 will be closely monitored. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The CBRT will implement Liraization Strategy in order to create an institutional basis for permanent and sustainable price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Kazakhstan,2023-02-24,"The base rate remains unchanged at 16,75% February 24, 2023 Astana The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to keep the base rate at 16,75% per annum with the interest rate corridor +/- 1 pp. The decision was based on updated forecasts of the National Bank, data analysis, as well as an assessment of the inflation risks balance. External pro-inflationary factors remain amid the uncertainty of the geopolitical situation and its consequences, as well as high world food prices. Internal inflation risks are associated with stable domestic demand, restructuring of logistics and production chains, stimulating fiscal policy, as well as still high inflation expectations. The aggregate balance of factors justifies the need to maintain the base rate at the current level during the first half of 2023 in order to reduce inflation in the medium term. In January 2023, annual inflation continued to grow, amounting to 20,7%. The main driver remains the rise in food prices. At the same time, monthly inflation continued to slow down for the fourth month in a row to 1,1% (from 1,8% in September 2022), but still exceeds the historical average. Similarly to monthly inflation, core inflation indicators are also slowing down, but are formed at high levels. Inflation expectations declined after reaching a peak in December 2022, in line with the assumptions of the previous forecast. Nevertheless, inflation expectations are still high and a clear downward trend has not formed yet, which creates an obstacle to a rapid slowdown in inflation. Global inflation has started to slow down, driven by lower energy prices and some improvement in the supply chain situation. At the same time, the risks of accelerating inflation in the world due to tense labor market, strong consumer demand and China opening after the pandemic remain elevated. According to forecasts, global inflation will gradually slow down during the forecast period, which will be accompanied by a tight monetary policy of central banks, as well as weaker global economic growth. Amid the projected inflation decline in the trading partner countries, the pressure on consumer prices in Kazakhstan will weaken. Taking into account the new data, as well as external and internal factors, the inflation forecast was revised down slightly. At the same time, in 2023, the forecast range has been expanded due to uncertainty about fiscal stimulus in Kazakhstan and inflation dynamics in Russia. In the baseline scenario this year, annual inflation is projected to be in the range of 9-12%, in 2024  6-8%, in 2025  4-6%. Due to the base effect, the peak of annual inflation is expected in the first quarter of 2023. The improvement in inflation forecasts is due to the projected decline in the FAO index for grains, a good harvest in Kazakhstan, the strengthening of the real exchange rate of tenge, as well as the moderate impact of the migration shock on services. Forecasts for the Kazakhstan economy growth have been improved. Thus, in 2023-2025. GDP growth is expected at the level of 3,5-4,5%. The forecast has been revised due to more positive expectations for oil production and exports, with a gradual recovery in the economies of trading partner countries. Domestic demand is expected to grow sustainably amid stimulating government spending and favorable oil prices. Meanwhile, the positive imports dynamics due to fiscal stimulus, as well as the restraining real rate, will partially offset the domestic demand growth. The risk of the GDP forecast is the possible problems of access of Kazakhstan's exports to international markets. Pro-inflationary factors within the country may increase. There are still risks of accelerating the prices growth for food products due to the supply shock in the market of vegetable products. The overdue reforms of tariffs for regulated utilities and fuel prices can cause the effect of accelerating the growth of prices for a wide range of goods and services. Additional pro-inflation risks from the outside world are associated with a potential acceleration of monthly inflation rates in the Russian Federation amid the rising state budget expenditures, ruble depreciation and sanctions. These factors are not taken into account in the prerequisites of the basic scenario. In the future, their implementation may entail changes in forecasts. Under these conditions, maintaining the base rate in the first half of 2023 at current values will help stabilize inflation and gradually reduce it in the medium term. The key parameters of the forecast are given in the appendix to the press release. More complete information about the factors of the decision and forecast will be presented in the Monetary Policy Report on the official Internet resource of the National Bank on March 6, 2023. The next scheduled decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on April 7, 2023 at 12:00 Astana time.

Hungary,2023-02-28,"At its meeting on 28 February 2023, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 1 March 2023:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. Over the recent period, global economic growth has continued to slow; however. GDP growth has been more favourable than expected in the majority of EU countries. The outlook for global growth is characterised by duality. Looking ahead, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and the generally rising interest rate environment continue to pose significant downside risks. By contrast, the mild winter weather and the favourable levels of gas storage facilities are mitigating the adverse effects of the energy crisis in Europe, which points to an improvement in the outlook. Inflation has been moderating slowly but clearly in an increasing number of countries. Weakening demand, the easing of difficulties in production chains, the normalising international freight market and falling energy and commodity prices point to a further decline in global inflation. Risk appetite has been volatile since the beginning of 2023. After an initial, significant improvement, expectations for interest rate hikes by the world's leading central banks increased in view of incoming macroeconomic data, in parallel with this investor sentiment has deteriorated. Developments in the Russia-Ukraine war continue to create significant uncertainties. According to both market pricing and decision makers' communication, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are expected to continue interest rate hikes further. In addition, the ECB will start reducing the portfolio built under its asset purchase programme at a predictable pace through a reduction in the reinvestment rate from March 2023 onwards. In the CEE region, the Czech, the Polish and the Romanian central banks left key interest rates unchanged. In 2022 as a whole. Hungary's economic performance increased by 4.6 percent, exceeding the EU average. Hungarian economic growth slowed further in the last quarter of 2022. Based on preliminary data, the GDP grew by 0.4 percent relative to a year earlier, with industry and market services being the main contributing sectors. By contrast, the significant decline in agricultural output acted as a brake on growth. In December, the volume of retail sales and construction output fell, while industrial production rose. Based on surveys, the outlook for production has deteriorated slightly over the past month, while the household confidence indicator has remained at a low level following a slight improvement. The labour market remains tight, and the unemployment rate is low. The time profile and structure of domestic GDP is expected to be characterised by strong duality in 2023. Initially subdued growth is expected to be followed by a pick-up in the second half of the year. Decline in real incomes, rising corporate costs, delayed public investments and the stricter interest rate environment all have a restraining impact on domestic demand. Despite subdued global economic activity. Hungary's foreign market share is expected to increase due to growing domestic export capacities, which is supported by the dynamic expansion of battery production. According to the December Inflation Report projection. Hungary's GDP is expected to increase by 0.51.5 percent this year, by 3.54.5 percent in 2024 and by 3.04.0 percent in 2025. In January 2023, annual inflation was 25.7 percent and core inflation stood at 25.4 percent. The increase in inflation was mainly driven by a rise in fuel prices. Incoming data was in line with the December Inflation Report projection. The acceleration in food inflation stopped in January. Within this group of products, the annual price indices for both processed and unprocessed food fell slightly. Repricing in market services at the beginning of the year was significantly greater than previously. However, mainly two sectors, health care and telecommunications services contributed significantly to this. Inflation expectations continue to be elevated; however, companies' expectations for retail and services prices have remained below their peak levels seen in the summer. Disinflationary effects are expected to increase in the coming months, causing a turnaround in inflation. Global energy, commodity and food prices have fallen below the levels observed before the Russia-Ukraine war. In addition, the moderating effect on pricing arising from the fall in domestic demand and, from the spring months, the fading of base effects will support the decline in inflation. Tight monetary conditions contribute to avoiding second-round inflationary effects and anchoring inflation expectations. Domestic inflation is expected to decrease gradually in the first half of 2023, and then more significantly from the middle of the year. The consumer price index will return to the central bank tolerance band in 2024. A trend reversal in the current account balance has clearly started in recent months, as exports expanded, gas prices moderated, and household consumption adjusted. In line with this, the current account deficit declined substantially based on December data. From 2023, the increasing surplus in items of the current account excluding the energy balance, growing adjustment in the energy market and lower gas prices may lead to a rapid improvement. In parallel with the normalising global economic environment and terms of trade, as well as with the utilisation of new export capacities built recently, the trade balance will improve significantly, and as a result, the current account deficit is expected to be reduced further. Domestic financial market developments have been stable recently. The measures taken by the Bank  in particular the regular use of the discount bill  have restored the balance in the swap market, and its results are undoubtedly reflected in the stabilisation of the forint exchange rate. The Monetary Council kept the base rate at 13 percent at its meeting today. The current level of the base rate is adequate to manage fundamental inflation risks. The O/N deposit rate and the O/N collateralised borrowing rate were left unchanged at 12.5 percent and 25 percent, respectively. There has been a general and broad-based increase in yield environment as a result of the MNB's instruments introduced in the autumn to absorb interbank forint liquidity on a long-term basis, i.e. the revised reserve requirement system, the one-week discount bill and the long-term deposit tender. These measures have led to a sustained improvement in monetary policy transmission, which is critical to achieving the price stability objective over the monetary policy horizon. Based on this positive experience, the MNB will use these instruments in the coming period, as well. By raising the reserve requirement ratio and restructuring interest rates, the Monetary Council has tightened further the impact of the required reserves on liquidity. At its January meeting, the Council decided to raise the required reserve ratio to 10 percent, effective from 1 April. Today the Council made changes to the interest rate on reserve accounts in order to increase further the amount of liquidity absorbed on a long-term basis and thereby to improve monetary policy transmission. The MNB will exempt 2.5 percent of the reserve base from bearing interest, while continuing to remunerate the base rate on 7.5 percent of the reserve base, and, in order to encourage greater utilisation, optional reserves will be remunerated at the overnight quick deposit tender rate instead of the base rate. In addition to strengthening monetary policy transmission, the Bank will use one-day deposit quick tenders and FX swap transactions in the coming period in order to ensure financial market stability, and it will continue to be available in meeting foreign currency liquidity needs to reach market balance related to the energy account. In the Monetary Council's assessment, it is necessary to maintain the current level of the base rate over a prolonged period, which will ensure that inflation expectations are anchored and the inflation target is achieved in a sustainable manner. The MNB is constantly assessing incoming data and developments in the outlook for inflation and is ready to take appropriate actions if risks increase. Looking ahead, maintaining market stability and strengthening monetary policy transmission are also key to achieving price stability. The MNB continues to focus on trend-like developments in financial market conditions. Therefore, the Bank takes into account the persistence of the recent improvement in risk perceptions when setting the conditions of overnight instruments introduced in mid-October."
Poland,2023-03-08,"Warsaw, 8 March 2023 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 7-8 March 2023 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ▪ reference rate at 6.75%; ▪ lombard rate at 7.25%; ▪ deposit rate at 6.25%; ▪ rediscount rate at 6.80%; ▪ discount rate at 6.85%. In 2022 Q4, global economic growth slowed down. In the euro area  despite some improvement in recent months  economic conditions remain weakened. At the same time, forecasts suggest a significant slowdown in GDP growth in 2023. Inflation in major advanced economies has declined. However, in most economies, it remains high, driven by lagged effects of the earlier supply shocks, including in energy market, as well as demand factors and increasing labour costs. In recent months, prices of energy commodities have declined, which together with softening of supply chain disruptions reduces price pressures. It is reflected in systematically declining growth in producer prices. At the same time, core inflation remains high. The Federal Reserve of the United States and the European Central Bank continue to increase their interest rates. In turn, central banks in Central-Eastern Europe  after earlier significant monetary policy tightening  are now keeping interest rates unchanged. Amid the weakening of economic growth around the world, also in Poland activity has slowed down. In 2022 Q4, real GDP growth declined to 2.0% y/y. Reduction in consumption demand lowers economic growth. At the same time, investments continue to increase. Despite the slowdown in activity, labour market situation remains good, including low unemployment. The number of working persons remains high, although its decline in the private sector is observed. CPI inflation in Poland in January 2023  according to Statistics Poland flash estimate  was 17.2% y/y. The increase in inflation compared to December was driven to a large extent by an increase in VAT rates for energy goods. At the same time, despite weakening demand growth, the level of inflation was still affected by a significant increase in costs  1/2 resulting from an earlier strong surge in international commodity prices and disruptions in global value chains  that was passed through to consumer prices. However, for several months commodity prices and PPI inflation have been decreasing, which signals a gradual easing of external supply shocks. Together with weakening economic activity, it will support a decline in domestic CPI inflation in the coming quarters. The Council became acquainted with the results of the March projection of inflation and GDP based on the NECMOD model. In line with the projection, prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 28 February 2023, there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of 10.2  13.5% in 2023 (against 11.1  15.3% in the November 2022 projection), 3.9  7.5% in 2024 (compared to 4.1  7.6%) and 2.0  5.0% in 2025 (compared to 2.1  4.9%). At the same time, the annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of -0.1  1.8% in 2023 (against -0.3  1.6% in the November 2022 projection), 1.1  3.1% in 2024 (compared to 1.0  3.1%) and 2.0  4.3% in 2025 (compared to 1.8  4.4%). The Council assessed, that the weakening of the external economic conditions, together with a decline in commodity prices, will continue to curb global inflation, which will contribute to lower price growth in Poland. Decline in domestic inflation will be supported by the weakening in GDP growth, including consumption, amid significant decrease in credit growth. As a result, the Council assesses that the earlier strong monetary policy tightening undertaken by NBP will lead to a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target. At the same time, given strength and persistence of the recent shocks that remain beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, the return of inflation to the NBP inflation target will be gradual. Such an assessment is supported by the March projection of inflation and GDP. A decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by appreciation of zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council's assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy. Further decisions of the Council will depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity. NBP will take all necessary actions in order to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability, including above all to bring inflation to the NBP inflation target in the medium term. NBP may intervene in the foreign exchange market, in particular to limit fluctuations of the zloty exchange rate that are inconsistent with the direction of monetary policy."
Malaysia,2023-03-09,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 2.75 percent. In the global economy, there were some positive developments with the reopening of China's economy and better-than-expected growth outturns in major economies, supported by resilient domestic demand. Nevertheless, the global economy continues to be weighed down by elevated cost pressures and higher interest rates. Headline inflation moderated slightly from high levels in recent months, but core inflation remained above historical averages. Some central banks are expected to continue raising interest rates to manage inflationary pressures. This will continue to pose headwinds to the global growth outlook. The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, mainly from an escalation of geopolitical tensions, higher-than-anticipated inflation outturns, and a sharp tightening in financial market conditions. The Malaysian economy expanded strongly by 8.7% in 2022 driven by the recovery in private and public sector spending following the full reopening of the economy. After the strong performance in 2022, the economy is expected to moderate in 2023 amid a slower global economy. Growth will remain driven by domestic demand. Household spending will be underpinned by sustained improvements in employment and income prospects. Tourist arrivals are expected to continue rising, further lifting tourism-related activities. The continued progress of multi-year infrastructure projects will support investment activity. The implementation of projects from the recently re-tabled Budget 2023 would provide upside risks to the domestic growth outlook. Downside risks continue to stem mainly from global developments, including from weaker-than-expected growth outturns or much tighter and more volatile global financial conditions. Headline and core inflation are expected to moderate over the course of 2023, but will continue to be elevated amid lingering demand and cost factors. The extent of upward pressures to inflation will remain partly contained by existing price controls and fuel subsidies, and the remaining spare capacity in the economy. The balance of risk to the inflation outlook is tilted to the upside and continues to be highly subject to any changes to domestic policy on subsidies and price controls, as well as global commodity price developments. At the current OPR level, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic growth. The MPC will continue to assess the impact of the cumulative OPR adjustments, given the lag effects of monetary policy on the economy. The MPC remains vigilant to cost factors, including those arising from financial market developments, that could affect the inflation outlook. Further normalisation to the degree of monetary policy accommodation would be informed by the evolving conditions and their implications to the domestic inflation and growth outlook. The MPC will continue to calibrate the monetary policy settings that balance the risks to domestic inflation and sustainable growth. Bank Negara Malaysia 9 March 2023."
Mongolia,2023-03-15,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged, re-setting the width of the policy rate corridor, and excluding certain liabilities of banks newly funded on international markets from the required reserves No: 2023/01 Date: March 15th, 2023 The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Mongolia (MPC) held its scheduled meetings on March 14th and 15th, 2023. With consideration of the current state of the economy and financial markets as well as the outlook and risks to the domestic and foreign economic environment, the MPC decided to: 1. Keep the policy rate unchanged at 13 percent, 2. Narrowing the policy rate corridor to be set at 1 percentage point above and below the policy rate, 3. Exclude certain liabilities of banks with maturities of 360 days or less that are newly funded on international markets in the form of bonds or loans from the reservable liabilities. Annual inflation reached 12.2 percent nationwide and 12.1 percent in Ulaanbaatar city as of February 2023. Inflation has been gradually decelerating in recent months consistent with our previous projections. A decline in inflation is mainly attributable to the decrease in transportation costs of imported goods. The inflation forecast has been revised downwards compared to the previous projection mainly reflecting the updated forecast of lower petroleum prices in the domestic market and decreasing influence of the supply- driven factors on inflation. Even though inflation is expected to decelerate further, higher effects of exchange rate pass-through and demand-driven factors remain the main risks for the inflation projection. Economic activity was stronger than anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2022 owing to the easing of “Zero-Covid” policy in China and higher growth in all economic sectors except energy and trade sectors than our expectation. As easing border restrictions and intensifying activities in the mining sector, the economic growth outlook has been upgraded compared to the previous projections. The outlook for foreign demand and prices of main export commodities has improved. In addition, major central banks have started to slow their tightening pace as global inflation has been declining gradually. Despite such improvements in the external and domestic economic condition, supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions remain the major risks in the external sector. External risks and uncertainties remain high. As such, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged, narrow the policy rate corridor and exclude certain liabilities of banks with maturities of 360 days and less from the reservable liabilities. These policy measures are aiming to reduce inflation to its target level at a faster pace and ensure both internal and external economic balances, through increasing domestic currency yield and encouraging banks to raise their foreign currency funding. The subsequent policy actions would depend on developments in the external and domestic economy as well as changes in the outlook of inflation and macroeconomic conditions. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Peru,2023-03-15,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT FEBRUARY 2023 BCRP MAINTAINED THE REFERENCE RATE AT 7.75% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain the reference rate at 7.75 percent. This pause does not necessarily imply an end to the BCRP's monetary tightening cycle. Future reference rate adjustments will be conditional on new information about inflation and its determinants, including the macroeconomic effects of the recent political unrest. In January, month-on-month inflation was 0.23 percent and core inflation was 0.05 percent. Year-on-year inflation increased from 8.46 percent in December to 8.66 percent in January, due to higher prices for locally produced food, while core inflation increased from 5.59 percent in December to 5.80 percent in January, both above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The significant increase in international food and fuel prices since the second half of 2021, accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in global inflation in magnitudes not seen in many years and towards levels significantly higher than the inflation targets of central banks, both in advanced and other economies in the region. In the case of domestic inflation, it has been exacerbated by the political unrest since December. A downward trend in year-on-year inflation is forecast since March, with a return to the target range in the fourth quarter of this year, due to a moderation of the impact of international food and fuel prices, a reversal of agricultural supply shocks, and declining inflation expectations in the rest of the year. One-year-ahead expected inflation increased from 4.30 percent in December to 4.62 percent in January, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Most leading and expectations indicators for economic activity deteriorated in January, and remain in pessimistic territory. The outlook for global economic activity has improved slightly; however, global risks remain due to monetary tightening in advanced economies, the impact of inflation on consumption, and international conflicts. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants, including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, to consider, if necessary, changes in the monetary stance. The Board reaffirms its commitment to adopt the necessary actions to ensure the return of inflation to the target range over the forecast horizon. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 5.25 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 8.25 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months and the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months. In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates based on the amount of the operations. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on March 9, 2023."
Euroarea,2023-03-16,"Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. Therefore, the Governing Council today decided to increase the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points, in line with our determination to ensure the timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. The elevated level of uncertainty reinforces the importance of a data-dependent approach to our policy rate decisions, which will be determined by our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are monitoring current market tensions closely and stand ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area. The euro area banking sector is resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions. In any case, our policy toolkit is fully equipped to provide liquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed and to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy. The new ECB staff macroeconomic projections were finalised in early March before the recent emergence of financial market tensions. As such, these tensions imply additional uncertainty around the baseline assessments of inflation and growth. Prior to these latest developments, the baseline path for headline inflation had already been revised down, mainly owing to a smaller contribution from energy prices than previously expected. ECB staff now see inflation averaging 5.3 per cent in 2023, 2.9 per cent in 2024 and 2.1 per cent in 2025. Inflation excluding energy and food continued to increase in February and ECB staff expect it to average 4.6 per cent in 2023, which is higher than foreseen in the December projections. Subsequently, it is projected to come down to 2.5 per cent in 2024 and 2.2 per cent in 2025, as the upward pressures from past supply shocks and the reopening of the economy fade out and as tighter monetary policy increasingly dampens demand. The baseline projections for growth in 2023 have been revised up to an average of 1.0 per cent as a result of both the decline in energy prices and the economy's greater resilience to the challenging international environment. ECB staff then expect growth to pick up further, to 1.6 per cent, in both 2024 and 2025, underpinned by a robust labour market, improving confidence and a recovery in real incomes. At the same time, the pick-up in growth in 2024 and 2025 is weaker than projected in December, owing to the tightening of monetary policy. The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website. I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. The euro area economy stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2022, thus avoiding the previously expected contraction. High inflation, prevailing uncertainties and tighter financing conditions dented private consumption and investment, which fell by 0.9 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively. Under the baseline, the economy looks set to recover over the coming quarters. Industrial production should pick up as supply conditions improve further, confidence continues to recover, and firms work off large order backlogs. Rising wages and falling energy prices will partly offset the loss of purchasing power that many households are experiencing as a result of high inflation. Moreover, the labour market remains strong, despite the weakening of economic activity. Employment grew by 0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the unemployment rate stayed at its historical low of 6.6 per cent in January 2023. Government support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should be temporary, targeted and tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy. As energy prices fall and risks around the energy supply recede, it is important to start rolling back these measures promptly and in a concerted manner. Measures falling short of these principles are likely to drive up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a stronger monetary policy response. Moreover, in line with the EU's economic governance framework and as stated in the European Commission's guidance of 8 March 2023, fiscal policies should be oriented towards making our economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area's supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, can help reduce price pressures in the medium term. To that end, governments should swiftly implement their investment and structural reform plans under the Next Generation EU programme. The reform of the EU's economic governance framework should be concluded rapidly. The decline resulted from a renewed sharp drop in energy prices. By contrast, food price inflation increased further, to 15.0 per cent, with the past surge in the cost of energy and of other inputs for food production still feeding through to consumer prices. Inflation excluding energy and food increased to 5.6 per cent in February and other indicators of underlying inflation have also stayed high. Non-energy industrial goods inflation rose to 6.8 per cent in February, mainly reflecting the delayed effects of past supply bottlenecks and high energy prices. Services inflation, which rose to 4.8 per cent in February, is also still being driven by the gradual pass-through of past energy cost increases, pent-up demand from the reopening of the economy and rising wages. Wage pressures have strengthened on the back of robust labour markets and employees aiming to recoup some of the purchasing power lost owing to high inflation. Moreover, many firms were able to raise their profit margins in sectors faced with constrained supply and resurgent demand. At the same time, most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent, although they warrant continued monitoring, especially in light of recent volatility in market-based inflation expectations. Risks to the outlook for economic growth are tilted to the downside. Persistently elevated financial market tensions could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected and dampen confidence. Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine and its people continues to be a significant downside risk to the economy and could again push up the costs of energy and food. There could also be an additional drag on euro area growth if the world economy weakened more sharply than expected. However, companies could adapt more quickly to the challenging international environment and, together with the fading-out of the energy shock, this could support higher growth than currently expected. The upside risks to inflation include existing pipeline pressures that could still send retail prices even higher than expected in the near term. Domestic factors, such as a persistent rise in inflation expectations above our target or higher than anticipated increases in wages and profit margins, could drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. Moreover, a stronger than expected economic rebound in China could give a fresh boost to commodity prices and foreign demand. The downside risks to inflation include persistently elevated financial market tensions that could accelerate disinflation. In addition, falling energy prices could translate into reduced pressure from underlying inflation and wages. A weakening of demand, including owing to a stronger deceleration of bank credit or a stronger than projected transmission of monetary policy, would also contribute to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term. Market interest rates rose considerably in the weeks following our last meeting. But the increase has strongly reversed over recent days in a context of severe financial market tensions. Credit to firms has weakened further, owing to lower demand and tighter credit supply conditions. Household borrowing has become more expensive as well, especially owing to higher mortgage rates. This rise in borrowing costs and the resultant decline in demand, along with tighter credit standards, have led to a further slowdown in the growth of loans to households. Amid these weaker loan dynamics, money growth has slowed sharply, driven by its most liquid components. Summing up, inflation is projected to remain too high for too long. Therefore, the Governing Council today decided to increase the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points, in line with our determination to ensure the timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. The elevated level of uncertainty reinforces the importance of a data-dependent approach to our policy rate decisions, which will be determined by our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are monitoring current market tensions closely and stand ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area. In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission."
Ukraine,2023-03-16,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep the key policy rate at 25% per annum and take a number of additional measures to spur competition among the banks for retail term deposits. Such steps will contribute to the attractiveness of hryvnia savings improving further and to supporting stability on the FX market, and will create preconditions for FX restrictions to be eased. This will help protect households' savings from inflation and will secure a decline in the pressure on prices. At the start of 2023, inflation has been declining more rapidly than the NBU expected but is still high. Inflation in Ukraine decelerated for the second month in a row, to 24.9% yoy in February. The decline in inflation started earlier and was faster than forecast by the NBU. This was facilitated, among other things, by an increase in supply of foods and fuel, a fast-paced recovery in the energy system after russia's attacks, and weaker consumer demand. Fixed official exchange rate of the hryvnia and frozen utility tariffs were also important factors restraining the rise in consumer prices. Measures taken previously by the NBU, including maintaining the key policy rate at 25%, raising required reserve ratios, introducing new deposit products, and calibrating FX restrictions contributed to the strengthening of the hryvnia in the cash segment of the market. This improved inflation and exchange rate expectations, in particular. The complete cessation of monetary financing of the budget from the start of the year was also a favorable factor. In spite of this, inflation remains high and pressures from business costs are persistently strong. Some factors that have been restraining inflation in several past months may be temporary. For example, an increase in food supply and faster stabilization of the fuel market largely owed to the mild winter. Inflation will continue to slow, including due to the NBU's measures to improve the attractiveness of hryvnia assets and support exchange rate stability. The attractiveness of hryvnia term deposits improving further on the back of lower pressures in the cash segment of the FX market will prompt depositors to increase their savings in the domestic currency. This will make the FX market more resilient and protect international reserves, supporting an improvement in exchange rate and inflation expectations going forward. A slowdown in global inflation, including the decline in energy prices, and the high base effect of the first year of the full-scale war will also contribute to a drop in the inflationary pressure. Relatively moderate consumer demand will also curb price growth. At the same time, the duration and the intensity of hostilities and further destruction of critical infrastructure remain important risks to the inflation dynamics. The risks of the following are also relevant:. additional budgetary needs and substantial quasi-fiscal deficits in the energy sectorcomplicated or blocked operation of the grain corridorearly monetary policy easing by leading central banks in response to rising threats to financial stability, which might lead to slower global disinflation and higher volatility on global financial markets.Regular inflows of international financing, including the financing under the anticipated new IMF program, are an important precondition for macrofinancial stability. International financial assistance will remain the main source for covering deficits of the state budget and the balance of payments. The larger share of financing needed for this year has already been approved by international partners. Moreover, the IMF's Extended Fund Facility is expected to be launched in the near future. Taking into account potential inflows of financing from international partners, including the IMF, and further revival of the domestic debt market, budget needs will be fully covered in 2023 without resorting to monetary financing of the budget deficit. In turn, the NBU will be able to continue maintaining sufficiently high international reserves and balance the FX market. With a view to bringing down inflation further, protecting hryvnia savings from being eroded away by inflation, and maintaining a stable exchange rate, the NBU Board decided to keep the key policy rate at 25%. It also decided to introduce additional measures to boost competition among the banks for household time deposits. Interest rates on hryvnia time deposits continue to rise, driven, among other things, by the central bank's previous measures. The banks that took the lead in raising their interest rates in recent months were able to improve the term structure of their deposits. That said, the largest banks, which among other things enjoy noncompetitive advantages in obtaining liquidity, still have interest rates that are not attractive enough to depositors given the high current and expected inflation. As a result, a substantial portion of household funds are being kept in current accounts. This is generating additional risks to macrofinancial stability, especially if administrative restrictions are eased further. In order to minimize the above risks, the NBU Board decided, starting from 7 April 2023, to adjust the operational design of monetary policy through:. introducing three-month certificates of deposit with a fixed rate that equals the key policy rate. The banks' ability to invest in these CDs will depend on the volumes of their hryvnia household deposits with initial maturities from three months, as well as on how successful the banks are in increasing their volumes of these deposits. The first quantitative tender to place CDs with maturities of up to three months is scheduled to be held on 7 April 2023. More detailed terms and conditions for participating in this tender will be announced to the banks before 6 April 2023. The NBU intends to use this instrument for at least one year.cutting the interest rate on overnight certificates of deposit, to 20%.What is more, the NBU declared that, starting from 11 May 2023, preferential required reserve ratios for hryvnia (0%) and FX (10%) time household deposits will only apply to deposits with initial maturities from three months. The above measures will bolster the market stimuli that encourage the banks to raise hryvnia time household deposits, which will decrease risks to the FX market and international reserves as FX restrictions are eased. In particular, these measures will help:. ensure continued growth in interest rates on time deposits, thus more strongly protecting hryvnia household savings from being eroded away by inflationdevelop the culture of making hryvnia savingsencourage the banks to step up their activity on the interbank market andboost the status of the key policy rate as an effective instrument that has a significant impact on the money market and the business behavior of economic agents.The NBU will continue to deliver the monetary conditions required for a steady drop in inflation, improving inflation expectations, and supporting exchange rate sustainability. If required, the NBU will adjust monetary conditions, taking into account the balance of risks and any changes in the macroeconomic forecast, in order to safeguard price and exchange rate stability, while also laying the foundations for a gradual easing in FX restrictions. When the financial system and the economy start functioning normally, the NBU will gradually return to the operation design of monetary policy which was in place before the full-scale invasion, and which is used by countries that target inflation. The decision to keep the key policy rate, at 25% per annum, was approved by NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No. 101, dated 16 March 2023, which will come into effect on 17 March 2023. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 27 March 2023. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 27 April 2023, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
Russia,2023-03-17,"On 17 March 2023, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 7.50% per annum. Current rates of price growth remain moderate, including in the stable components of inflation. Inflation expectations of households are down significantly but remain elevated, as do businesses' price expectations. High-frequency data suggest that a recovery in business and consumer activity is ongoing. Accelerating fiscal spending, deteriorating terms of foreign trade and the situation in the labour market continue to pose pro-inflation risks. The overall balance of inflation risks has remained essentially the same since the previous Board meeting. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as the risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. If pro-inflation risks intensify, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of key rate increase in the key rate at its upcoming meetings. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will come in at 5.07.0% in 2023 to return to 4% in 2024. Inflation movements. Annual price growth in February was down to 11.0% (from 11.8% in January). Since the beginning of 2023, the average rate of current price growth has held close to 4% in annual terms and above the average for the fourth quarter of 2022. At the same time, current price growth in February decelerated relative to January. This was in part due to its volatile components. The weakening of the ruble since late 2022 has so far shown little in price movements. In the stable components of inflation, current price growth rates remain moderate. Inflation expectations of households and price expectations of companies remain elevated. At the same time, inflation expectations of households have declined significantly in March. Analysts' medium-term inflation expectations are anchored close to 4%. The Bank of Russia forecasts that annual inflation will temporarily fall below 4% in the coming months under the influence of last year's high base effect. At the same time, sustained inflationary pressure will gradually increase from moderately low levels. According to the baseline scenario, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will come in at 5.07.0% in 2023, return to 4% in 2024 and will be close to 4% further on. Monetary conditions have remained broadly neutral. Since the previous key rate meeting of the Board. OFZ yields and credit and deposit market rates have been essentially unchanged. Despite a slowdown in early 2023, credit activity has been high overall, primarily in the corporate segment. Households' and businesses' funds in current accounts and bank deposits have increased, with fiscal spending still a meaningful contributor to this growth. For all the elevated inflation expectations and ongoing improvements in consumer sentiment. Russian consumers have sustained a cautious stance. This is reflected in the high propensity to save and the increased share of liquid assets (current accounts and ruble cash) in the savings structure. Economic activity. In 2022. GDP declined 2.1%, which is better than the February estimate by the Bank of Russia. High-frequency data for the first quarter of 2023 show that economic activity continues to pick up. Growing domestic demand is supporting an improvement in business sentiment despite some deterioration of the external environment. However, the current capacity to expand production in the Russian economy is largely limited by the labour market. Unemployment dropped to a new low. Labour shortages are increasing in many industries amid the effects of the partial mobilisation as growth in businesses' demand for labour continues. In these circumstances, productivity growth can lag behind real wage growth. Changes in the aggregate demand structure continue amid the structural transformation of the economy. Consumer demand is gradually recovering but remains subdued overall. Investment demand in the private sector is slowing down amid growing government investment. Overall, the contribution of fiscal policy to the expansion of aggregate demand is still increasing. Inflation risks. The medium-term balance of risks has not significantly changed, remaining tilted towards pro-inflation risks. Meaningful pro-inflation risks are related to geopolitical tensions that affect foreign trade terms. A strengthening in foreign trade and financial restrictions can further weaken demand for Russian exports, contributing to inflation growth through exchange rate movements. Moreover, the increasing complexity of production and supply chains and payments due to external restrictions could lead to both higher import prices and tighter supply-side constraints in the Russian economy. Additionally, a deterioration in the global economic growth outlook can also come as a significant short-term inflation driver amid instability in the financial markets of advanced economies. The Bank of Russia's baseline scenario rests on the decisions already made regarding the mid-term expenditure path of the federal budget and the fiscal system as a whole. In case of a further budget deficit expansion, pro-inflation risks will rise and tighter monetary policy may be required to return inflation to target in 2024 and keep it close to 4% further on. Pro-inflation risks from the labour market persist. Labour shortages in some sectors may lead to labour productivity growth lagging behind growth in real wages. High and unanchored inflation expectations, which are particularly sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations, are also a source of risk. Under these conditions, the continuing growth of the most liquid assets in the structure of household savings may spur a rise in consumer demand in the future. A disinflationary risk for the baseline scenario is the continued high propensity of households to save amid increased general uncertainty as households take time to adapt to a new supply structure in consumer markets. A growing risk premium in bond yields and lending rates may further tighten monetary conditions, which will restrain lending in the economy. A more rapid adaptation of the economy, accompanied by an active recovery of imports among other things may also have a disinflationary effect. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. If pro-inflation risks intensify, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of key rate increase at its upcoming meetings. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 28 April 2023. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the medium-term forecast are to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. Statement by Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina in follow-up to Board of Directors meeting on 17 March 2023.

Pakistan,2023-03-20,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement March , 2023. At its meeting held on 2nd March 2023, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to increase the policy rate by 300 basis points to 20 percent. During the last meeting in January, the Committee had highlighted near-term risks to the inflation outlook from external and fiscal adjustments. Most of these risks have materialized and are partially reflected in the inflation outturns for February. The national CPI inflation has surged to 31. percent y/y, while core inflation rose to 17. percent in urban and 21. percent in rural basket in February 2023. In today's meeting, the MPC noted that the recent fiscal adjustments and exchange rate depreciation have led to significant deterioration in the near term inflation outlook and further upward drift in inflation expectations, as reflected in the latest wave of surveys. The Committee expects inflation to rise further in the next few months as the impact of these adjustments unfolds before it begins to fall, albeit at gradual pace. The average inflation this year is now expected in the range of 27 29 percent against the November 2022 projection of 21 23 percent. In this context, the MPC emphasized that anchoring inflation expectations is critical and warrants strong policy response. On the external side, the MPC noted that despite substantial reduction in the current account deficit (CAD), vulnerabilities continue to persist. In January 2023, the CAD fell to $242 million, the lowest level since March 2021. Cumulatively the CAD at $3. billion in Jul-Jan FY23 is down 67 percent compared to the same period last year. Notwithstanding this improvement, scheduled debt repayments and decline in financial inflows amid rising global interest rates and domestic uncertainties, continue to exert pressure on FX reserves and the exchange rate. The MPC noted that FX reserves remain low and concerted efforts are needed to improve the external position. In this regard, conclusion of the ongoing 9th review under the IMF's EFF will help address near-term external sector challenges. Furthermore the MPC stressed on the urgent need for energy conservation measures to alleviate pressure on the external account and meet the import requirements of other sectors. Recent fiscal measures including an increase in GST and excise duties, reduction in subsidies, adjustments in energy prices, and the austerity drive are expected to help contain the otherwise widening fiscal and primary deficits. As highlighted in earlier statements, the envisaged fiscal consolidation is critical for economic stability and will complement the ongoing monetary tightening in bringing down inflation over the medium-term. The Committee emphasized that any significant fiscal slippages will undermine monetary policy effectiveness in the context of achieving the price stability objective. The MPC also assessed the impact of further monetary tightening on financial stability and the near-term growth outlook. The Committee views that the risks to financial stability remain contained, given that financial institutions are broadly well capitalized. On growth, however, there exists trade-off. The MPC, nonetheless, reiterated its earlier view that the short-term costs of bringing down inflation are lower than the long-term costs of allowing it to become entrenched. Barring unexpected future shocks, the MPC noted that today's decision has pushed the real interest rate in positive territory on forward-looking basis. This will help anchor inflation expectations and steer inflation to the medium-term target of percent by end- FY25. The Committee also decided to hold its next meeting on April , 2023. Page."
Nigeria,2023-03-21,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 147 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON MONDAY 20th AND TUESDAY 21st MARCH, 2023 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 20th and 21st March, 2023, faced with new and existing headwinds, undermining the full recovery of the global economy. These include the recent bank failures in the United States and Switzerland, amidst widespread monetary policy tightening, which introduced a new dimension to the risks confronting the global financial system, as well as, the persisting high but receding global inflation. The continued hostilities between Russia and Ukraine and its implications to the smooth functioning of the global supply chain also remain a critical strain to the recovery of global output growth. In the domestic economy, output recovery progressed at a relatively moderate pace, while headline inflation trended upwards, albeit less aggressively, driven mainly by a marginal increase in food inflation. The Committee assessed key risks to the global economy associated with these developments and their impact on the Nigerian economy, as well as, the outlook for the rest of the year. Twelve (12) members of the Committee attended this meeting. Global Economic Developments The Monetary Policy Committee noted the new and existing headwinds to the broad stability of the global economy. Primary amongst these is the risk of a global financial contagion from the recent bank failures in the United States and Switzerland. In Europe, the war between Russia and Ukraine has continued unabated, causing critical strains to the commodities and energy markets as supply chain bottlenecks remain, while the lingering risk of the resurgence of several variants of the Corona virus persists after China set aside its Zero-COVID Policy. Furthermore the deteriorating relations between the US. China. Russia and some major oil producers in the Middle East, continue to contribute to increased volatility in the oil market. In the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies, the unfolding tight external financing conditions and shock spillovers from the Advanced Economies, could further dampen the recovery of output growth. In light of these developments, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its January 2023 World Economic Outlook, forecast global output growth for 2023 at 29 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in 2022. Growth is, however, expected to improve to 31 per cent in 2024. While global inflation shows sign of deceleration, monetary policy normalization is progressing unabated, especially amongst key Advanced Economy central banks, targeted at moderating global demand pressure. Price development across several economies is thus expected to remain high throughout 2023, but to decelerate gradually in 2024. The key factors expected to keep inflation above the long-run target of several central banks include: the persisting disruption to energy markets associated with continued war between Russia and Ukraine; high commodity prices; and general disruptions to the global supply chain associated with uncertainties around the COVID-19 pandemic in China and the ongoing tensions between the US and China over Taiwan's sovereignty. Across several Emerging Market and Developing Economies, inflationary pressures have remained high due largely to rising energy prices, high prices of grains and exchange rate pressures associated with capital flows to high yield US dollar-denominated assets. In the global financial markets, renewed fears of a global financial contagion are forcing investors to move away from the equities market to safer assets such as gold, while others seek higher returns in treasury securities with improved yields. With several Advanced Economy central banks progressing with monetary policy normalization, global financial conditions will likely remain tight, thus reinforcing the reassignment of financial portfolios to reflect the risk aversion of investors. Domestic Economic Developments Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 310 per cent in 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, it grew by 352 per cent (year-on-year), compared with 398 per cent in the corresponding period of 2021 and 225 per cent in the preceding quarter. The economy maintained a positive growth trajectory for nine consecutive quarters, since exiting recession in 2020. The improved performance was driven largely by sustained growth in the services and agricultural sectors, a rebound in economic activities associated with economic recovery and continued intervention in growth enhancing sectors by the Bank. Staff projections showed that output growth recovery is expected to continue into 2023 and 2024. The Committee, however, observed with concern, the marginal increase in headline inflation (year-on-year) in February 2023, to 2191 per cent, from 2182 per cent in January 2023, a 009 percentage point increase. This increase was attributed largely to a minimal rise in the food component to 2435 per cent in February 2023, from 2432 per cent in January 2023, while the core component moderated to 1884 per cent in February 2023, from 1916 per cent in January 2023. The shocks to the food component were driven by high cost of transportation of food items, lingering security challenges in major food- producing areas and legacy infrastructural problems, which continue to hamper food supply logistics. Broad money supply (M3) grew by 1314 per cent (annualized) in February 2023 (year-to-date), below the 2023 provisional annual benchmark of 1718 per cent. This was driven largely by the growth in Net Foreign Assets (NFA), which was attributed to the increase in foreign asset holdings of the Central bank and decrease in foreign claims on Other Depository Corporations (ODCs). Money market rates reflected the tight liquidity conditions in the banking system. Consequently the monthly weighted average Open Buyback (OBB) and Inter-bank Call rates increased to 1274 and 1254 per cents in February 2023, from 1014 and 1035 per cent in January 2023, respectively. The Committee noted the continued stability in the banking system, reflected by the performance of the Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs). The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) stood at 137 per cent. Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio of 42 per cent and Liquidity Ratio (LR) of 431 per cent, as of February 2023. The MPC observed the sustained improvement in the equities market in the review period, as the All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalization (MC) both increased to 54,,91539 and N2992 trillion on March 17, 2023, from 51,,25106 and N2792 trillion on December 30, 2022, respectively, indicating renewed investor confidence in the Nigerian financial market. The Committee, however, noted the marginal decline in the level of gross external reserves to US$3613 billion in February 2023, from US$364 billion in January 2023, a decrease of 07 per cent, reflecting the downtrend in crude oil prices, as global uncertainties persist. The Committee reviewed the performance of the Bank's various interventions aimed at stimulating production and productivity across the real sector. Between January and February 2023, the Bank disbursed N1265 billion to three agricultural projects under the Anchor Borrowers' Programme (ABP), bringing the cumulative disbursement under the Programme to ₦109 trillion to over 46 million smallholder farmers cultivating or rearing 21 agricultural commodities on an approved 602 million hectares of farmland across the country. The Bank also released the sum of ₦2370 billion under the ₦10 trillion Real Sector Facility to eight new real sector projects in agriculture, manufacturing, and services. Cumulative disbursements under the Real Sector Facility currently stands at ₦243 trillion, disbursed to 462 projects across the country, comprising 257 manufacturing, 95 agriculture, 97 services and 13 mining sector projects. Under the 100 for 100 Policy on Production and Productivity (PPP). The Bank also released ₦301 billion under the Nigerian Electricity Market Stabilisation Facility (NEMSF-2) for capital and operational expenditure of distribution companies (Discos) aimed at improving their liquidity status and aid their recovery of legacy debt. This brings the cumulative disbursement under the facility to ₦25439 billion. Outlook The overall outlook for the full recovery of both the global and domestic economies, remained clouded by new and legacy downside risks. Available data and forecasts for key macroeconomic variables for the Nigerian economy, suggest that the domestic economy will continue to recover for the rest of 2023 at a moderate pace, in light of evolving and persisting shocks to the economy. The continued upward pressure on inflation, rising cost of debt and debt servicing, as well as deteriorating fiscal balances remain headwinds, which may undermine the smooth path to a faster recovery. Accordingly the Nigerian economy is forecast to grow in 2023 by 303 per cent (CBN), 337 per cent (FGN) and 320 per cent (IMF). The Committee's Considerations At this meeting. MPC focused its attention not only on the inflationary trends in most major economies, but also on the reported impact of policy rate hikes: aimed at rein-in inflation on financial system stability in the global financial system. The MPC hence took time out to discuss the recent bank failures in the US and Switzerland, an event that occurred following the persistent interest rate hikes in the US, and how this has adversely impacted the broad portfolio of banks in the US. It noted that whereas MPR was increased by 500 basis points in Nigeria, from 125 per cent in 2022 to 175 per cent in January 2023, the Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) in Nigeria shows that the Nigerian banking system remain resilient due largely the stringent prudential guidelines put in place by the CBN which has resulted in a strong build-up of not only the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) in Nigeria, but also the Liquidity Ratio and capital Adequacy Ratio. In the light of these strong FSIs. MPC was comforted that its various decisions in increasing MPR have had moderate impact on inflation, given that the rate appears to have plateaued in Nigeria. The Committee's major considerations at this meeting, therefore, focused on arriving at key policy mechanisms to shield the economy from emerging shocks from the global economy, as well as sustain its focus on domestic price stability. Headline inflation, in the view of members, remained high with increased expectations of price development, due to the perennial scarcity of PMS and ongoing discourse around the removal of fuel subsidy. With the prices of other energy products also rising, members stressed the importance of addressing price development. The Committee also considered the continued impact of exchange rate pressure on domestic price levels and called for policies to attract both portfolio and foreign direct investment to Nigeria. It maintained optimism that, the continued progress made with the RT200 FX programme. Naira-4-dollar and other policies targeted at attracting diaspora remittances, would continue to help improve accretion to the external reserves and improve liquidity in the foreign exchange market. While output growth remains on a positive trajectory. Members called for increased monetary and fiscal coordination to support the recovery in light of risks confronting the domestic economy. To this end, the Committee enjoined the fiscal authority to explore other avenues to improve non-oil revenue to reduce the fiscal deficit and public debt burden. Following new risks of financial contagion emerging from the scenario of failed banks in some Advanced Economies, members examined the possibility of shocks to the Nigerian banking system from these banks and concluded that the Nigerian banking system remains reasonably insulated from such likely contagion. The CBN has been able to achieve this through stringent micro and macro-prudential guidelines that have ensured that individual banks and the banking industry in Nigeria have adequate buffers to ward-off global contagion. In addition to this, the MPC examined the possible impact of further policy rate hikes on the stability of the banking system and was convinced that further hikes would not adversely impact the stability of the banking system. The Committee, however, called on the Bank's Management to strengthen its regulatory oversight on the banking system to ensure that the banking industry remain stable and resilient. The Committee's Decision The MPC noted that while the continued rise in headline inflation remained a significant problem confronting the economy, other macroeconomic variables are moving in the right direction, despite observed headwinds. The Committee's debate at this meeting, therefore, was whether to continue its rate hike to further dampen the rising inflation trajectory or hold to observe emerging development and allow for the impact of the last five rate hikes to permeate the economy. Loosening in the view of members, would gravely undermine the gains achieved so far. The MPC observed the continued upward risk to price development around expectations on the removal of the PMS subsidy; rising prices of other energy sources; continuing exchange rate pressure; and uncertain climatic conditions. These in the view of members, provides a compelling argument for an upward adjustment of the policy rate, albeit, less aggressively. The Committee, however, noted that the naira redesign and cash withdrawal limit policies have resulted in a sizeable reduction in Currency-Outside-Banks, indicating an expected improvement in the potency of monetary policy tools. Members however, remained aware of the ongoing challenges associated with the limits imposed on cash withdrawals in the face of frequent downtime in bank electronic transaction channels. The Committee thus called on Other Depository Corporations, online payment platforms, and other stakeholders to ensure that the prevailing incidence of network failures is overcome in the immediate and short term. This would ensure that the Naira Redesign and Cash Withdrawal Limit Policies lead to an improved in-road of the CBN Cashless program and efficiency of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Members thus, resolved by a majority vote to raise the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 50 basis points. In Summary, ten (10) members voted to raise the MPR by 50 basis points, one member voted to raise the MPR by 25 basis points and one member voted to hold the MPR. All members voted to keep all other parameters constant. The MPC, therefore, voted to: I Raise the MPR by 50 basis points to 180 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 325 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele CON Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 21st March 2023."
Brazil,2023-03-22,"Since its previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom), the global environment has deteriorated. The episodes involving banks in the United States and Europe have increased the uncertainty and the volatility in markets and require monitoring. At the same time, recent data on global activity and inflation remain resilient and the process of monetary policy tightening in major economies continued to advance. Regarding the domestic scenario, the recent set of indicators of activity continues to be in line with the deceleration expected by Copom. Consumer inflation as well as the various measures of underlying inflation are above the range compatible with meeting the inflation target. Inflation expectations for 2023 and 2024 collected by the Focus survey have increased, and are around 6.0% and 4.1%, respectively. Copom's inflation projections in the reference scenario* also increased and stand at 5.8% for 2023 and 3.6% for 2024. Inflation projections for administered prices are 10.2% for 2023 and 5.3% for 2024. The Committee decided again to emphasize the six-quarter-ahead horizon, which refers to the third quarter of 2024, in which the 12-month inflation projection stands at 3.8%. In an alternative scenario, with a constant interest rate throughout the relevant horizon, inflation projections stand at 5.7%, 3.3% and 3.0% for 2023, the third quarter of 2024 and the year 2024, respectively. The Committee judges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher than usual. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; the uncertainty about the fiscal framework and its impacts on the expected path of the public debt; and a larger or more persistent deanchoring of long-term inflation expectations. Among the downside risks, it should be noted an additional reduction in the prices of international commodities measured in local currency; a greater than projected deceleration of global economic activity, particularly due to adverse conditions in the global financial system; and a slowdown in domestic credit concession larger than what would be compatible with the current stance of monetary policy. On one hand, the recent reinstatement of fuel taxes has reduced the uncertainty of the fiscal results in the short term. On the other hand, the current scenario, marked by high volatility in financial markets and deanchored long-term inflation expectations from the targets, requires further attention when conducting monetary policy. The Committee judges that the deanchoring of long-term inflation expectations raises the cost of the disinflation that is needed to reach the targets established by the National Monetary Council. In this scenario. Copom reaffirms its commitment to set monetary policy to meet the targets. Considering the assessed scenarios, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information. Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2023 and, to a larger degree, 2024. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing economic fluctuations and fostering full employment. Taking into account the uncertainty of the scenarios, the Committee remains vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets, which have shown additional deterioration, especially at longer horizons. The Committee reinforces that future monetary policy steps can be adjusted and will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto de Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Diogo Abry Guillen. Fernanda Magalhaes Rumenos Guardado. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza and Renato Dias de Brito Gomes. * In the reference scenario, the interest rate path is extracted from the Focus survey, and the exchange rate starts at USD/BRL 5.25 and evolves according to the purchasing power parity (PPP). The Committee assumes that oil prices follow approximately the futures market curve for the following six months and then start increasing 2% per year onwards. Moreover, the energy flag is assumed to be ""yellow"" in December 2023 and 2024. The value for the exchange rate is obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Philippines,2023-03-22,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to raise the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent, effective tomorrow, 24 March 2023. Accordingly, the interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities will be set to 5.75 percent and 6.75 percent, respectively. The Monetary Board's decision was based on the sum of new information and its assessment of the effects of past policy actions, which warranted a continuation of monetary tightening to anchor inflation expectations. With core inflation rising in February despite a modest decline in headline inflation, further monetary policy action was deemed necessary to address broadening price impulses emanating from robust domestic demand and lingering supply-side constraints. The latest baseline projections point to an elevated path over the near term. Average inflation is projected to settle above the upper end of the 2-4 percent target range at 6.0 percent in 2023 before returning to the target at 2.9 percent in 2024. The inflation forecasts reflect the cumulative impact of the BSP's policy rate adjustments and the slower growth outlook on both the domestic and external fronts. Moreover, inflation expectations have increased slightly for 2023, while those for 2024 and 2025 remain near the upper end of the target band. The Monetary Board supports the creation of the Inter-agency Committee on Inflation and Market Outlook. The balance of risks to the inflation outlook for 2023 and 2024 also continue to tilt heavily towards the upside. The effect of supply shortages on domestic food prices remains a concern, while the potential impact of higher transport fares, increasing electricity rates, as well as above-average wage adjustments in 2023 point to the broader-based nature of price pressures. On the downside, the impact of a weaker-than-expected global economic recovery continues to be the primary factor that could dampen inflation. Given these considerations, the Board decided that follow-through monetary action would help ease persistent price pressures from here and abroad as well as further realign inflation expectations with the target band over the policy horizon. Further policy tightening will also preserve the buffer against external spillovers amid heightened uncertainty and volatility emanating from financial sector distress in advanced economies. Nevertheless, even as the BSP has assessed that the Philippine banking system is resilient to evolving market conditions, the BSP continues to keep a watchful eye over developments in the international banking industry. Moving forward, the BSP reassures the public that monetary authorities remain ready to respond further to inflation risks in line with the BSP's data-dependent approach to ensuring price and financial stability."
United States,2023-03-22,"EDT March 22, 2023 Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have picked up in recent months and are running at a robust pace; the unemployment rate has remained low. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Recent developments are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects is uncertain. The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy. The Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. (more)In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C Williams. Vice Chair; Michael S Barr; Michelle W Bowman; Lisa D Cook; Austan D Goolsbee; Patrick Harker; Philip N Jefferson; Neel Kashkari; Lorie K Logan; and Christopher J Waller. -0- For media inquiries, please email media@frb.gov or call 202-452-2955."
Turkiye,2023-03-23,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 8.5 percent. Although recently released data point to a stronger economic activity than anticipated, recession concerns in developed economies as a result of geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes continue, and conditions threatening financial stability have emerged. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the high level in producer and consumer inflation continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. While the divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue due to their diverse economic outlook, coordinated steps are taken that prioritize financial stability through swap agreements and new liquidity facilities. Financial markets have been adjusting their expectations that the central banks would end the rate hike cycles in the near term. Before the disaster of the century, leading indicators have been pointing to a stronger domestic demand compared to foreign demand as well as an increase in the growth trend in the first quarter of 2023. The impact of the earthquake on production, consumption, employment and expectations is being extensively evaluated. While the earthquake is expected to affect economic activity in the near term, it is anticipated that it will not have a permanent impact on performance of the Turkish economy in the medium term. While share of sustainable components of economic growth remains high, the stronger-than-expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues throughout the year. On the other hand, domestic consumption demand, high level of energy prices and the weak economic activity in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. As announced in the 2023 Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy document, the Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and the entire policy toolset, particularly funding channels, will be aligned with liraization targets. The Committee will prioritize the creation of supportive financial conditions in order to minimize the effects of the disaster and support the necessary recovery. While level and underlying trend of inflation have been improved with the support of the implemented integrated policy approach, the effect of earthquake-driven supply-demand imbalances on inflation is closely monitored. It has become even more important to keep financial conditions supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment after the earthquake. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The Committee assessed that the current monetary policy stance is adequate to support the necessary recovery in the aftermath of the earthquake by maintaining price stability and financial stability. The effects of the earthquake in the first half of 2023 will be closely monitored. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The CBRT will implement Liraization Strategy in order to create an institutional basis for permanent and sustainable price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Hungary,2023-03-28,"At its meeting on 28 March 2023, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 29 March 2023:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. Global economic growth slowed further in the fourth quarter of 2022; nevertheless. GDP growth has been more favourable than expected in most EU countries. The global growth outlook continues to be characterised by duality. The escalation of market concerns related to certain banks, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and the generally rising interest rate environment cause downside risks. By contrast, the mild winter weather and the favourable level of gas storage facilities mitigate the adverse effects of the energy crisis in Europe, which points to an improvement in the outlook for growth. Inflation has been moderating slowly but clearly in an increasing number of countries. The slowdown in global economic activity, weakening demand, the correction in global energy and commodity prices and the fall in international freight costs point to a further decline in global inflation. Investor sentiment has deteriorated since the Monetary Council's last policy decision. From mid-March, the escalation of concerns about the stability of certain banks led to an increase in global risks and, as a result, expectations about future actions of the world's leading central banks changed significantly and the risk assessment of emerging market assets deteriorated. In March, the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates by 25 and 50 basis points, respectively. Reacting to financial market turbulences in the wake of bank failures, the Fed launched a new funding scheme and improved liquidity by introducing dollar swap lines through a cooperation with several central banks. In its press release, the ECB emphasised that the euro area banking sector was resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions. Central banks in the CEE region have not changed monetary conditions since the MNB's February policy decision. The Hungarian economy grew by 4.6 percent in 2022. Growth dynamics slowed down in the last quarter of the year. Based on detailed data. GDP grew by 0.4 percent in the last three months of the previous year relative to a year earlier, with industry and market services being the main contributing sectors. By contrast, the significant decline in agricultural output acted as a brake on growth. In January, the volume of retail sales and construction output fell significantly, while industrial production decreased to a smaller extent. Based on surveys, production prospects have improved overall in the past month, while the household confidence indicator is still at a low level. The labour market remains tight, and the unemployment rate is low. The time profile and structure of domestic GDP is expected to be characterised by a duality this year. Output growth will be weighed down mainly by domestic demand factors, as high inflation reduces the purchasing power of household incomes, which in turn causes a further slowdown in consumption. Rises in corporate costs and the uncertain demand outlook are expected to result in the postponement and rescheduling of investments. Economic growth is expected to pick up again from the second half of the year as inflation declines markedly and investment recovers. Both internal and external factors may make a positive contribution to growth in 2024. Domestic inflation peaked in January 2023. In February, annual inflation was 25.4 percent and core inflation stood at 25.2 percent. Inflation slowed by 0.3 percentage points compared to the previous month, to which the decline in fuel prices and the slowdown in the price dynamics of processed food contributed the most. Food price inflation slowed for the second consecutive month in February, reflecting a slight moderation in the annual index of both processed and unprocessed food. Inflation expectations continue to be elevated; however, corporate price expectations for retail sales and services have been below their peak values of last summer for several months. In the coming months, the consumer price index is expected to decrease slowly at first, then at an increasingly rapid pace. Tight monetary conditions are expected to have broader disinflationary effects, leading to a substantial slowdown in inflation. There has been a significant decline in energy and commodity prices as well as in international freight costs, tensions in value chains have eased, and the slowdown in global economic activity has also acted as a restraint on external inflation. The decline in domestic demand has reduced companies' room for manoeuvre regarding prices increases, and actions of the Hungarian Competition Authority acts in the direction of an increasingly disciplined pricing behaviour. The consumer price index will return to the central bank tolerance band in 2024. Based on preliminary financial accounts data, the deficit target for 2022 was met. The fiscal deficit will continue to decline in the coming years. The fiscal deficit is projected to be 3.9 percent in 2023, while the plans for 2024 and 2025 are 2.5 and 1.5 percent, respectively. The decline in energy prices helps to contribute to meeting the deficit targets; however, tight budget management is necessary to achieve the targets. Based on preliminary data, the government debt ratio has decreased to 73.6 percent of GDP by the end of 2022, and it is expected to decline to 69 percent this year and close to 65 percent by the end of the forecast horizon. The current account deficit will decline steadily from 2023, it improved by EUR 0.9 billion in January 2023 from a low of EUR 1.7 billion last November, reflecting buoyant exports, the slowing growth in imports due to a slowdown in investment and consumption dynamics, in addition to an improvement in the energy balance driven by a decline in energy prices. In parallel with a normalising global economic environment and the utilisation of new export capacities built recently, the trade balance will continue to improve in 2024. As a result, the current account deficit will halve in 2023 and the country's net lending will turn positive again towards the end of the forecast horizon. Since mid-October 2022, the risk assessment of the Hungarian economy has improved. However, concerns about certain participants of the global banking system have increased uncertainty in international financial markets, which has led to strong volatility in emerging markets. The MNB closely monitors the extent and persistence of changes in the risk environment. The capital and liquidity position of domestic banks are stable; banks continuously comply with regulatory requirements with robust buffers based on regularly performed stress tests and are able to meet the economy's financing needs. Financial market turbulences were accompanied by a general decline in bank share prices around the world. However, the stability of the European banking sector has improved significantly in the past decade, due in part to much stricter regulation than before. The Monetary Council kept the base rate at 13 percent at its meeting today. The current level of the base rate is adequate to manage fundamental inflation risks. The O/N deposit rate and the O/N collateralised borrowing rate were left unchanged at 12.5 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The Monetary Council highlighted four alternative scenarios around the baseline projection in the March Inflation Report. The risk scenario featuring decelerating global economic activity presumes growth and inflation paths that are lower than the baseline scenario. The scenario presenting an increase in the risk of second-round inflationary effects presumes a higher inflation path and a somewhat higher growth path compared to the baseline scenario. In the alternative scenario presuming capital withdrawal from the emerging markets, higher inflation is accompanied by more moderate growth. As a result of the more cautious consumer behaviour, the risk scenario assuming lower consumption results in a lower inflation and growth path compared to the baseline scenario. There has been a general and broad-based increase in the yield environment as a result of the MNB's instruments introduced in last autumn to absorb interbank forint liquidity on a long-term basis, i.e. the revised reserve requirement system, the one-week discount bill and the long-term deposit tender. These measures have led to a sustained improvement in monetary policy transmission, and therefore, based on this positive experience, the MNB will continue to use these instruments in the next period in order to achieve the goal of price stability. Consistent with its earlier announcement, the Monetary Council will further tighten the effect of required reserves on interbank liquidity by raising the reserve requirement ratio and changing its interest rate structure from 1 April. According to the January decision, the required reserve ratio will rise to 10 percent. In addition, pursuant to the Council's February decision, a system of tiered interest rates will be applied to the reserve account, which encourages increase in the share of liquidity tied up on a long-term basis further enhancing monetary policy transmission. In addition to strengthening monetary policy transmission, the MNB will use one-day deposit quick tenders and FX swap transactions in the coming period in order to ensure financial market stability. Furthermore, the Bank promotes financial market stability by using its euro liquidity providing swap instrument and its central bank discount bill with maturities extending through the end of the quarter. In the Monetary Council's evaluation, the euro swap instrument related to energy imports has contributed effectively to achieving stability in the foreign exchange market. The decrease in energy market prices in recent months results in a gradual improvement in the energy balance. In line with this, there has been a significant decline in energy importing companies' need for foreign currency hedging. Taking into account the purpose of the instrument and financial market developments, the Monetary Council decided that the instrument will remain available until 31 March 2023. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank will closely monitor the effects of foreign currency conversions resulting from the coverage of energy imports and will be ready to use the euro swap instrument again if warranted. In the Monetary Council's assessment, it is necessary to maintain the current level of the base rate over a prolonged period, which will ensure that inflation expectations are anchored and the inflation target is achieved in a sustainable manner. The MNB is constantly assessing incoming data and developments in the outlook for inflation and is ready to take appropriate actions if risks increase. Looking ahead, maintaining market stability and strengthening monetary policy transmission are also key to achieving price stability. The Bank is closely monitoring the effects of increased uncertainty in international financial markets on the risk environment. The MNB will continue to take into account persistent changes in risk perceptions when setting the conditions of overnight instruments introduced in mid-October."
Georgia,2023-03-29,"29.03.2023 THE NATIONAL BANK OF GEORGIA KEEPS ITS MONETARY POLICY RATE UNCHANGED AT 11.0 PERCENT On March 29, 2023, the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) decided to keep the monetary policy rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged. The monetary policy rate stands at 11.0 percent. Despite certain stabilization signs, inflation remains a global challenge. In Georgia, annual inflation is still high, but follows a downward trajectory. In February, headline inflation decreased to 8.1 percent, while core inflation dropped to 6.6 percent. The decline in inflation is mainly due to external factors. In particular, international oil prices have been decreasing recently, whereas international shipping costs have also approached the pre-pandemic level. In addition, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the international food price index continues to decrease. Given the stronger lari exchange rate these trends are being gradually transmitted to the local market reducing the imported inflation. Despite the overall decline, both core and domestic inflations remain high. The reduction of headline inflation has been supported by tight monetary policy and fiscal consolidation. It should also be noted that as a result of the macroprudential policy instruments activated recently and the tightening of global financial conditions, credit growth in Georgia has slowed down. This, in turn, further contributes to the stabilization of aggregate demand and hence the downward trend in inflation. Given the above, it is important that inflationary expectations are declining. The current forecast, due also to the base effect and tightened monetary policy stance, shows that the headline inflation will continue declining at a significant rate, and is likely to be below the target level in the second half of the year, ensuring that long-term inflation expectations remain anchored to the target. Despite the aforementioned positive factors, uncertainty remains quite high, due to the severe geopolitical situation. Possible pressures from the labor market are worth noting among the upward risks affecting inflation. In particular, productivity growth has been lagging behind the wage growth in recent periods. According to GeoStat, in the fourth quarter of 2022, wages have increased by 21.2 percent annually, while productivity was up by only 6.8 percent. This trend is reflected in the prices of domestic goods and services, growth rate of which is still high and amounts to 13.8 percent. Considering the high uncertainty and risks, the NBG remains focused on reducing inflation and maintains a tight monetary policy. If the current trends are maintained, it will be possible to begin a gradual exit from the tight monetary policy stance only after the trend of reduction in domestic inflation is evident. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on May 10, 2023."
Thailand,2023-03-29,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 2/2023 Mr. Piti Disyatat. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 29 March 2023 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 150 to 175 percent, effective immediately. The Thai economy should continue to expand, driven mainly by tourism and private consumption. Exports of goods are recovering and expected to gain strength in the second half of this year. However the global economic uncertainty has increased, in part from persistent inflationary pressures and episodes of banking stresses in advanced economies. Headline inflation would likely return to the target range in the middle of the year, but core inflation remains elevated with upside risks from higher cost pass-through and demand pressures. The Committee deems a continuation of gradual policy normalization to be appropriate in light of the growth and inflation outlook, and voted to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point at this meeting. The Committee projects the economic growth to be 36 and 38 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively. key impetus is the broad-based recovery in tourism, which should promote employment and labor income, in turn sustaining private consumption. Meanwhile merchandise exports show signs of rebounding after contracting at the end of last year, and should gather momentum in the second half of this year. However persistently high inflation and banking stresses in some advanced economies pose risks to the global economic outlook. Headline inflation would likely return to the target range by mid-2023, and is projected to decline to 29 and 24 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Easing supply-side pressures, notably from electricity and oil prices, are key contributing factors. Core inflation is projected to fall to 24 and 20 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively. However persistently high inflation remains a risk, as producers could pass on higher costs absorbed in the past and demand-side pressures could pick up as the recovery gains traction. The Committee will continue to closely monitor price developments. The overall financial system remains resilient. Recent banking stresses in some advanced economies have not had a significant impact on the Thai financial system, as Thai financial institutions and corporations have limited linkages with the troubled banks and risky assets. Moreover financial institutions maintain high levels of capital and loan loss provision. However as the situation remains fluid and uncertain, there is a need to closely monitor the developments and continuously assess potential impact on Thailand's 2 financial stability. As for households and businesses, the ongoing economic recovery has improved debt serviceability. Financial fragilities nonetheless remain for some SMEs and certain households exposed to rising living costs and higher debt burden. The Committee agrees that financial institutions should continue to press ahead with debt restructuring and deems it important to have in place targeted measures and sustainable debt resolution for vulnerable groups. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, tightening somewhat from higher private sector funding costs consistent with the policy interest rate. On balance, financial conditions are supportive of the ongoing recovery and mobilization of funds by the private sector. The baht continues to fluctuate against the US dollar, driven by the Federal Reserve's uncertain policy outlook and financial market volatility induced by banking stresses in advanced economies. The Committee is closely monitoring developments in the financial market and any impact on the domestic financial market including the exchange rate. Under the prevailing monetary policy framework, the Committee seeks to maintain price stability, support sustainable growth in line with potential, and preserve financial stability. In view of these objectives, the Committee judges the broad contour of economic recovery to be on track with some upside risks to inflation stemming from demand pressures. The Committee thus decided to increase the policy interest rate to normalize the monetary policy stance in a gradual and measured manner toward a level consistent with long-term sustainable growth. The Committee is prepared to adjust the size and timing of policy normalization should the evolving growth and inflation outlook differ from the current assessment.

Colombia,2023-03-30,"With the decision made at today's session, monetary policy maintains its goal of driving inflation toward the 3.0% target. In its policy discussion, the Board considered the following elements. Inflation in January and February exhibited lower monthly increases than those observed throughout 2022. Annual food inflation started 2023 exhibiting progressive declines that placed it at 24.1% in February, a figure significantly below the one for December 2022 (27.8%). These results suggest that the inflation rate is approaching its ceiling, from which the expected decrease for 2023 would start taking place. Inflation expectations are beginning to incorporate this positive news about the recent behavior of inflation. The survey to economic analysts conducted by Banco de la Republica in March showed that 12-month inflation expectations fell from 7.7% in January to 7.2% in March for the median of the sample. Something similar was observed for the corresponding 24-month expectation, which dropped from 4.5% to 4.0%. The economic monitoring index (ISE) registered an annual variation of 5.8% in January, higher than in December 2022 (1.2%) and than the figure expected by the technical staff (3.2%). The technical staff increased its GDP growth forecast for 2023 from 0.2% to 0.84%. Despite this upward revision, economic activity is still characterized by a significant slowdown. Between January and March, volatility in international markets has been exceptional due to financial stability problems in the United States and in some European countries. This situation has added uncertainty about the evolution of global economy, but its effects on the Colombian economy have been limited. Future decisions by the Board will depend on the new information available. Fecha de publicacion."
Egypt,2023-03-30,"Press Release  March 30th, 2023 MPC decided to raise key policy rates by 200 bps In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 200 bps to 1825 percent, 1925 percent, and 1875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also raised by 200 bps to 1875 percen. On the global front, forecasts for international commodity prices have eased compared to those underlying the previous MPC meeting, but their outlook remains uncertai. Notable factors include the outlook for global supply bottlenecks and global economic activity, especially in light of the reopening in China coupled with the recent financial sector issues in advanced economie. The latter factor has contributed to large volatility in financial conditions indices in key markets such as the US and EU, which confirms an increased level of uncertainty regarding the global economic outloo. Domestically growth in real economic activity moderated to 39 percent in 2022 Q4 compared to 44 percent in 2022 Q3, implying that growth during the first half of FY 2022/23 registered 42 percen. Detailed sectoral data for 2022 Q3 show that growth was primarily driven by the improvement in private sector activity, specifically tourism, agriculture and trad. Additionally most leading indicators continue to register positive growth rates in 2023 Q1. Going forward, real GDP growth is expected to soften in fiscal year 2022/23 compared to the previous fiscal year, before picking up thereafte. Meanwhile the unemployment rate recorded 72 percent in 2022 Q4 compared to 74 percent in the previous quarte. Annual urban headline inflation continued to increase to record 258 percent and 319 percent in January and February 2023, respectivel. Similarly annual core inflation recorded 312 percent in January 2023 and marked a historical high in February 2023 by recording 403 percen. The witnessed strong dynamics reflect the combined effect of several factor. These factors include the supply chain disruptions domestically, the depreciation of the Egyptian pound, demand side pressures as evidenced by developments in real economic activity relative to potential capacity and high broad money growth outturn. In addition, the seasonal impact of Ramadan affected both Umrah trips and food price. The MPC continues to assess the impact of the front-loaded tightening policies in a data-driven manner, with recent inflation developments showing higher broad-based inflation across CPI item. These recent developments necessitate additional tightening in the monetary stance, not only to contain demand side pressures as mentioned above, but also to avoid broad and persistent inflationary effects that could emanate from the supply shocks, with the aim of anchoring inflation expectation. In light of the above, the MPC decided to raise policy rates by 200 bps and reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of forecasted inflation rather than prevailing inflation rate. The MPC stresses that achieving a tight monetary stance is a necessary condition to attain the CBE's upcoming inflation targets of 7 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2024 Q4 and 5 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2026 Q4. The MPC will continue to monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance in line with its price stability mandat. Monetary Policy Sector monetarypolicy@cbeorge."
Mexico,2023-03-30,"Global inflation remains at high levels, although in a large number of economies, headline inflation continued decreasing. The core component continued showing persistence. Recently, international financial markets registered turbulence due to greater risk aversion generated by the developments in the US and European banking systems. Financial authorities have implemented measures such as increasing the protection of bank deposits and the provision of liquidity, in order to maintain confidence in the financial system. Most central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, continued raising their reference rates. The outlook for 2023 implies a deceleration. Among key global risks are the persistence of inflationary pressures, the intensification of geopolitical turmoil, tighter financial conditions, and the challenges to financial stability. Since the previous monetary policy decision, interest rates in Mexico showed generalized increases. After having appreciated, the Mexican peso has recently registered volatility in response to the higher risk aversion. The difficulties faced by certain banking institutions in the United States and Europe have had a limited impact on the domestic financial system. Banking institutions in Mexico exceed regulatory requirements in terms of liquidity and capitalization. Banco de Mexico will remain attentive to the developments in international financial markets and to any likely impact on the domestic financial market. Economic activity in Mexico has shown resilience in a complex external environment and continued increasing during the early part of 2023 at a moderate pace. The labor market remains strong. Since the last monetary policy meeting, annual headline inflation has decreased more than expected. This was a result of the evolution of the non-core component. Core inflation has adjusted downwards gradually. During the first fortnight of March, headline and core inflation registered 7.12% and 8.15% respectively. Inflation expectations for 2023 and 2024 were revised upwards again, while those for longer terms remained relatively stable. Forecasts for headline and core inflation were revised marginally, although their trajectories remain stable. Inflation is still projected to converge to the 3% target in the fourth quarter of 2024 (see table). These projections are subject to risks. On the upside: persistence of core inflation at high levels; foreign exchange depreciation due to volatility in international financial markets; greater cost-related pressures, and pressures on energy prices or on agricultural and livestock product prices. On the downside: a greater-than-anticipated slowdown of the world economy; a lower pass-through effect from some cost-related pressures; a decline in the intensity of the geopolitical conflict or a better functioning of supply chains; and a larger-than-anticipated effect from the Federal Government's 1 measures to fight elevated prices. The balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon remains biased to the upside. The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the inflationary shocks and its determinants, along with the evolution of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process. It considered the challenges stemming from the ongoing tightening of global financial conditions, the environment of uncertainty, the persistence of accumulated inflationary pressures and the possibility of greater effects on inflation, as well as the monetary policy stance already attained in this hiking cycle. Based on the above, and with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 11.25%. With this action, it slows the pace of interest rate increases and the monetary policy stance adjusts to the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon. The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations. The latter, in order to set a policy rate that is consistent at all times with both the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as with an adequate adjustment of the economy and financial markets. For its upcoming decision, the Board will take into account the inflation outlook, considering the monetary policy stance already attained. 2/ Forecast starting February 2023.

South Africa,2023-03-30,"PRESS STATEMENT 30 March 2023 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank As we enter the second quarter of the year, sticky inflation, sluggish growth and now elevated financial stability risks mark the global economy. Despite somewhat better growth outcomes in the first months of the year, we see no material easing of difficult global economic conditions. Russia's ongoing war in the Ukraine weighs heavily on European growth prospects, while financial conditions in the United States continue to tighten. The growth outlook for China has improved but is likely to remain modest by historical standards. Many economies in the developing world face weaker economic growth and prolonged adverse financing conditions.1 With inflation and policy rates remaining higher for 1 According to the IMF's October 2022 Global Financial Stability Report, eight low-income countries are in debt distress and 30 are at high risk of distress (out of 69 countries considered low-income countries—among which, there are some frontier markets). MPC Statement 30 March 2023 Page 1 longer, and new weaknesses emerging in financial institutions, we expect global financial markets to remain volatile. Taking these and other factors into account, the SARB's forecast for global growth in 2023 is revised higher to 2.0% (from 1.6%).2 Growth in 2024 is revised slightly lower to 2.5% (from 2.6%). The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) January update forecast global growth at 2.9% in 2023 and 3.1% in 2024. That forecast will be updated in April. The South African economy contracted by 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, considerably worse than expected at the time of the January meeting. The contraction was broad-based, consistent with the extensive load-shedding experienced in the final three months of the year. For the whole of last year. GDP growth of 2.0% was achieved, compared to the 2.5% previously expected. For 2023, the Bank's forecast for GDP growth is lowered slightly to 0.2% from the 0.3% expected in January. As a result of extensive load-shedding and logistical constraints, the supply performance of the economy remains severely impaired. As previously noted, these constraints deduct 2 percentage points from growth this year. Over the forecast period, we expect household spending and investment to grow modestly, even as loadshedding and uncertainty continue to weigh heavily on consumption and investment decisions.3 Private sector investment is expected to remain positive, in large part reflecting efforts to overcome constraints in energy and 2 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. 3 The number of days of expected load-shedding in 2023 remains unchanged at 250 days, 150 days and 100 days, respectively in 2023, 2024, and 2025. Estimates of the average stages of load-shedding is multiplied by the number of days and then multiplied by the cost to GDP per stage-day. The cost per stage has been revised lower for stages 1 and 2. In nominal terms, these costs vary between R0-R1.2 million for stages 1 and 2 and up to R204-R899 million for stages 3 to 6, when continued on a 24 hour basis on weekdays. MPC Statement 30 March 2023 Page 2 transport supply. The SARB's commodity price index, which in historical terms still remains above its long-run average, is forecast to continue to ease. As a result of these factors, the economy is forecast to expand by 1.0% in 2024 ( up from 0.7%) and by 1.1% in 2025 (up from 1.0%).4 Economic growth has been volatile for some time and prospects for growth appear even more uncertain than normal. An improvement in logistics and a sustained reduction in load-shedding or increased energy supply from alternative sources would significantly raise growth. Further upside risks to growth could emerge from a stronger recovery in China, if commodity export prices rise. Downside risks however emanate from more modest global growth rates and the lower terms of trade and trade volumes that would follow. Overall, the risks to the medium-term domestic growth outlook are assessed to be balanced. Nonetheless, the domestic and global outlook appears to be highly sensitive to new shocks. Core inflation remains high in much of the world and financial vulnerabilities have re-emerged to create new headwinds. Turning to inflation prospects, our current growth forecast leaves the output gap around zero, implying little positive or negative pressures on inflation from expected growth.5 South Africa's external financing needs however are expected to rise. With a sharply lower export commodity price index, stable oil prices, and somewhat weaker growth 4 The growth forecast includes expected changes in the policy rate as given by the QPM. 5 Potential growth for 2022 was revised higher to 0.7%, and lowered in 2023 to 0.0%. MPC Statement 30 March 2023 Page 3 in export volumes, the current account balance is forecast to deteriorate to a deficit of 2.7% of GDP for the next three years.6 Weaker commodity prices and higher state-owned enterprise financing needs will put pressure on financing conditions for rand-denominated bonds. Ten-year bond yields currently trade at about 11.2%, despite the expected moderation of inflation over the forecast period. The rand has generally weakened over the past year. Recent weeks have seen further sharp depreciation and then some reversal as sentiment shifted abruptly in the wake of policy decisions in some major advanced economies. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R18.06 (23q2) to the US dollar, compared with R17.32 at the time of the previous meeting. Currency markets are expected to remain volatile. While headline inflation eased in major economies (G3) in December, price pressures remain clearly evident in measures of core inflation, services and wages. In the G3 economies, consumer prices rose by 7.5% in 2022. Our estimate for inflation in the G3 is higher at 4.2% in 2023 (up from 4.0%) and 2.1% in 2024 (up from 1.8%) and unchanged at 2.0% in 2025 (up from 1.9%).7 The rise in South Africa's headline inflation rate has been shaped primarily by fuel, electricity and food price inflation. Fuel price inflation last year averaged 34.4% and is 6 In January, a current account balance of about -1.8% of GDP was expected for the forecast period. Exports are forecast to grow in real terms by only 1.8% this year and 2.3% in 2024. Commodity export prices rose by 1.4% in 2022. South Africa's commodity export index is forecast to decline by about 20% this year, and a further 11.7% in 2024, before stabilising somewhat in 2025. Our oil price forecast is also slightly lower than in January, averaging US$87 per barrel in 2023. The Brent crude oil assumptions are US$85 for 2024 and US$80 for 2025 (unchanged). 7 The G3 comprises the United States, the Eurozone, and Japan. The latest CPI inflation in the G3 sits at 6.0%, 8.5% and 3.3%. Local food price inflation is revised up again despite global food prices falling in dollar terms, in part due to the lagged impact of the weaker exchange rate.8 Food price inflation is now expected to be 9.9% in 2023 (up from 7.3%) and 4.5% in 2024 (up from 4.4%). Our forecast for core inflation is largely unchanged at 5.1% in 2023 (previously 5.2%) and 4.8% and 4.5% in 2024 and 2025. Services price inflation in 2023 is forecast to be 4.9%, lower than previously expected. Core goods inflation, however, is forecast higher for this year at 5.9% (up from 5.5%).9 The forecast for average salary growth and unit labour costs is somewhat lower in 2023 and higher in 2024 and 2025.10 With core goods and food higher in the near term, headline inflation for 2023 is revised significantly higher to 6.0% (up from 5.4%). Despite this, food and fuel inflation are expected to ease, resulting in a headline forecast of 4.9% for 2024 and 4.5% in 2025. Risks to the inflation outlook, however, are assessed to the upside. Despite some easing of producer price and food inflation, global price levels remain elevated. Russia's war in the Ukraine and China's economic rebound are expected to keep the global oil market relatively tight. Electricity prices and other administered prices 8 Inflation in agricultural commodities decelerated to 0.1% in 2022Q4 (from 8.5% in 2022Q3) due to vegetable oils and cereals components. This year, global food inflation is expected to be in deflation (after registering 14.2% in 2022) due to base effects and improving supply constraints. 9 Core goods refers to total CPI goods excluding food and NAB, fuel and electricity, whereas services include all surveyed services within the CPI basket. Core goods inflation is expected to be 4.9% in 2024 and 4.5% in 2025. 10 Average salaries were expected to be 6.9%, 5.5%, and 4.7% for 2023, 2024 and 2025 at the time of the January meeting. The March figures are 6.4%, 6.2%, and 5.1%, respectively. Productivity per unit of labour is lower due to reduced expected output. MPC Statement 30 March 2023 Page 5 continue to present clear short and medium-term risks. Domestic food price inflation surprised higher again in February, and risks of drier weather conditions have increased. Load-shedding may additionally have broader price effects on the cost of doing business and the cost of living, in particular as diesel consumption increases. Given sticky petrol and higher food price inflation, considerable risk still attaches to the forecast for average salaries. Interest rate levels in major economies are higher than were projected in January, averaging 3.8% in 2023 (up from 3.7%), 3.5% in 2024, and unchanged at 2.4% in 2025. Tighter global financial conditions raise the risk profiles of economies needing foreign capital, leading generally to weaker currencies. South Africa's risk premium is sharply higher and will likely remain elevated over the forecast period. Given load- shedding, upside inflation risks, and larger external financing needs, further currency weakness appears likely. Inflation expectations increased strongly over the past year. Average expectations of future inflation surveyed in the first quarter of this year increased further to 6.3% for 2023 and 5.8% for 2024.11 Expectations for inflation in 2023 based on market surveys are 5.8%.12 Long-term inflation expectations derived from the 5-year break-even rates in the bond market sit at 5.27%.13 Headline inflation breached the upper end of the target range in the second quarter of 2022, and is forecast to remain above it until the third quarter of this year. Headline 11 The BER Q4 2022 survey of inflation expectations indicated inflation at 6.1% in 2023 (up from 5.9% in Q3)) and 5.6% for 2024 (up from 5.3% in Q3). 12 At the median, market analysts (Reuters Econometer) in March expect inflation to be higher at 5.8% (from 5.6% in February) in 2023, 4.7% in 2024 and 4.7% in 2025. 13 Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These now sit at about 5.27% for the 5-year and 6.25% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year break-even inflation sits at 6.91%. MPC Statement 30 March 2023 Page 6 inflation is only expected to sustainably revert to the mid-point of the target range by the fourth quarter of 2024. The forecast takes into account the policy rate trajectory indicated by the Bank's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM). As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting in response to new data and risks. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 7.75% per year, with effect from the 31st of March 2023. Three members of the Committee preferred the announced increase. Two members preferred a 25 basis points increase. The revised repurchase rate is now less accommodative and is more consistent with the current view of risks to inflation. The aim of policy is to anchor inflation expectations more firmly around the mid-point of the target band and to increase confidence of attaining the inflation target sustainably over time.14 Guiding inflation back towards the mid-point of the target band can reduce the economic costs of high inflation and enable lower interest rates in the future. Achieving a prudent public debt level, increasing the supply of energy, moderating administered price inflation and keeping wage growth in line with productivity gains would enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy. Economic and financial conditions are expected to remain more volatile for the foreseeable future. In this uncertain environment, monetary policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. The 14 The forecasted trajectory for the repurchase rate implies a rise in the inflation-adjusted repo rate from -2.0% in 2022, to 1.6% for 2023, and 2.0% in 2024. The real repo level for 2025 is expected to be 2.4%. The real repurchase rates calculated here are based on the 1-quarter ahead inflation forecast and are annual average rates. MPC Statement 30 March 2023 Page 7 MPC will seek to look through temporary price shocks and focus on potential second round effects and the risks of de-anchoring inflation expectations. The Bank will continue to closely monitor funding markets for stress. Lesetja Kganyago GOVERNOR The next statement of the Monetary Policy Committee will be released on 25 May 2023.

Israel,2023-04-03,"The Monetary Committee decides on April 3, 2023 to increase the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.5 percent. Inflation in Israel is 5.2 percent over the past 12 months, and is high in a wide range of CPI components. There has been some moderation in annual inflation, but the moderation is slower than previous assessments. Inflation expectations and forecasts for the first year from all sources increased, and are around the upper bound of the target range. Expectations derived from the capital market for the second year onward are all within the target range. Economic activity in Israel is around the long-term trend, but its expansion has slowed relative to last year. The labor market is tight, and the employment rate remains at a level that reflects full employment. However, the job vacancy rate continues to decline moderately. The Research Department has revised its macroeconomic staff forecast, and presents two potential scenarios in view of the tremendous uncertainty due to legislative processes concerning the judicial system and their economic implications. Activity in the housing market is softening. The increase in home prices continues to moderate. The number of purchases and the volume of new mortgages continue to decline. In contrast, the upward trend in rental prices continued. Since the previous monetary policy decision, the exchange rates were volatile. At the end of the period, the shekel weakened by 1.5 percent against the US dollar, by 3.3 percent against the euro, and by 2 percent in termsof the nominal effective exchange rate. The global inflation environment remains elevated, but is in a moderating trend. However, the core indices in various countries continued to increase. The interest rate increases around the world are also continuing, but at a slower pace. In the scenario in which the dispute regarding the legislative changes concerning the judicial system is resolved in a way that does not have any effect on economic activity going forward, the Research Department's analysis is carried out similar to every quarter. In this scenario. GDP is expected to grow by 2.5 percent in 2023 and 3.5 percent in 2024 (Figure 16). The unemployment rate among the prime working ages (25-64) is expected to average 4.1 percent in 2023 and 4 percentin 2024. The average inflation rate in the fourth quarter of 2023 isexpected to be 3.9 percent, and it is expected to decline to 2.3 percent by the end of 2024. In addition, the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be about 59 percent in 2023 and 58 percent 2024. In the second scenario, the Research Department presents an analysis ofthe potential economic implications if the legal and institutional changesare accompanied by an increase in the country's risk premium, a negative impact to exports, and declines in domestic investments and in demand for private consumption. This scenario is accompanied by a higher level of uncertainty than the standard forecast, regarding the intensity and persistence of the shocks. Therefore, the analysis is presented over a single three-year bloc. The forecast presents an indication of the impact on economic developments and its scale in the coming three years. In a case where the effect of the changes subsides relatively quickly, the impact is estimated at an average of about 0.8 percent of GDP per year over the three-year period being examined.[1] In a case where the perception of the public (the financial markets, the real sector, and consumers) is that the impact of the legislative changes will persist, the impact is estimated at an average of about 2.8 percent of GDP per year over the coming three years. Economic activity in Israel is at a high level, and is accompanied by a tight labor market, although there is some moderation in a number of indicators. Inflation is broad and remains high. Therefore, the Monetary Committee decided to increase the interest rate. The interest rate path will be determined in accordance with activity data and the development of inflation, in order to continue supporting the attainment of the policy goals. Economic activity in Israel is at a high level, although there is some moderation in a number of indicators. The labor market remains tight and in a full employment environment. Inflation is above the target range, and encompasses a wide range of CPI components. Annual inflation moderated in February, although at a pace that is slower than previously assessed. The tighter monetary policy and moderation of activity abroad are expected to lead to some slowdown in economic activity in Israel, alongside a slowing of the pace of inflation. Since the previous policy decision, the CPI increased by 0.5 percent in February. Inflation in the past 12 months declined slightly in February compared with the January figure, and is above the upper bound of the target range, at 5.2 percent (Figure 1). With that, inflation in Israel remains lower than in most of the advanced economies (Figure 36). Net of energy and fruits and vegetables, inflation is 5.1 percent, and the figure remains 5.1 percent with the further neutralization ofthe effects of taxation and regulation (Figure 2). The pace of annual inflation of the nontradable components, which mainly reflectsthe housing component and services industries, is 5.5 percent: similar to the previous month. In contrast, the annual pace of inflation of the tradable components declined to 4.8 percent (Figure 3). One-year inflation expectations and forecasts from all sources increased, and are around the upper bound of the target range (Figure 6). Expectations derived from the capital market for the second year and onward declined slightly, and are within the target range (Figure 7). The Monetary Committee's assessment is that the monetary tightening processes in Israel and abroad, and the moderation of demand, are working to moderate inflation. Economic activity is around the long-term trend, although the pace of expansion has slowed relative to last year. The aggregate balance of the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey for February continues to reflect businesses' positive assessments of their situation (Figure 17). Supply chain stress continues to moderate (Figure 23). The equipment and raw materials constraintreported by companies in the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey is in a downward trend in various industries, and in the construction industry it has returned to its pre-COVID-19 level. Goods and services exports slowed relative to last year, but the level of activity remains high (Figure 21). At the same time, there was some worsening of the export orders constraint reported by manufacturing companies, although it remains low. In the services export industries, where the level of activity is particularly high, exports remained unchanged in January 2023 relative to December 2022, following a number of months of slight decline. The import of consumer goods and of investment assets stabilized, and the import of raw materials continues to decline (Figure 22). We are beginning to see a change in the trend of tax revenues, which had previously increased greatly relative to the pre-COVID-19 period. The labor market remains tight, and the employment rate continues to reflect full employment. The employment rate among those aged 15 and over (61.4 percent) increased in February, and is slightly higher than its precrisislevel. The employment rate among the prime working ages (25-64) is also higher than before the crisis (79 percent. Figure 25). The unemployment rate for those aged 15+ (3.9 percent) declined relative to the previous month, while the unemployment rate among the prime working ages remained unchanged from January (3.5 percent) (Figure 26). In parallel, the job vacancy rate continues to decline moderately. Despite this decline, it remains at a high level (Figure 27). The job vacancy rate in the high-tech industry continues to decline, in parallel to the sharp decline in capital raised relative to the high levels of 2021 and early 2022. The rate is currently lower than the 2019 average. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, there was a decline in the employee shortage constraint reported by companies in February compared with same month last year. The average wage per employee post in January 2023 shows an increase in the real wage, following the decline that began in 2022. Despite this, it remains lower than the long-term trendline (Figure 30). The Bank of Israel Research Department revised its macroeconomic forecast, and presents two potential scenarios in view of the tremendous uncertainty due to the legislative processes regarding the judicial system and theireconomic implications. The volume of activity in the housing market continues to moderate. ; Home prices increased by 14.6 percent in the past 12 months (Figure 12), and recent data indicate a moderation in the pace of increase, which was just 0.1 percent in February. The declines in the number of housing transactions and in the volume of new mortgages continue. In February, new mortgage borrowing totaled NIS 5.7 billion, about half the level of February 2022 (Figure 13). Despite the decline in the number of real estate transactions, there are no apparent signs of slowdown in the labor market in the construction industry. According to Central Bureau of Statistics data, there was a slowdown in building starts in the fourth quarter of 2022, but the annual level remained high: about 67,000 in 2022. At the same time, there was a moderate increase in building completions in 2022: about 52,000 housing units: while the number of building permits issued remains high at about 78,000 housing units. Rental prices increased by 0.5 percent in February. The housing component of the Consumer Price Index continued to rise, to 6.8 percent in the past year. In the domestic capital markets there were declines in the equity indices during the reviewed period, and the Israeli equity indices reflect underperformance relative to global equity indices since the beginning of the year. Yields on long-term government bonds increased slightly, in contrast with the global trend, which is characterized by declining yields. Corporate bond spreads widened (Figure 14). According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, the financing constraint reported by businesses remains relatively low (Figure 15). Since the previous monetary policy decision, the shekel weakened by 1.5 percent against the US dollar, by 3.3 percent against the euro, and by 2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The exchange rates were volatile during the period (Figure 8). Global economic activity remains moderate. This is in view of the events surrounding the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, a bank that specialized in credit to the high-tech industry, and the increase in risk of the global banking system. In contrast, there is lower concern of a serious recession in Europe, and economic activity in China is increasing, even though the pace is more moderate than previous assessments. Investment houses revised their global growth forecasts for 2023 slightly upward for most blocs (Figure 31). The global purchasing managers' indices of both advanced economies and emerging markets increased, with the index for advanced economies indicating economic expansion for the first time since June 2022 (Figure 32). Data on the volume of world trade for January 2023 continued to indicate a slowdown in the pace of global activity. The export orders component of the Purchasing Managers Index, which is a leading indicator of world trade data, indicates that in the coming months, some further moderation in the volume of world trade is expected. The leading equity indices traded with increased volatility, and most are slightly above their levels from the beginning of the reviewed period. Oil prices declined slightly. The global inflation environment remains high but is in a trend of moderation. In most advanced economies, although overall inflation has moderated, core inflation indices continue to increase (Figure 35). Interest rate increases around the world are continuing, but the pace has slowed. In the US, activity data continue to indicate relatively strong activity, and the labor market remains tight. The CPI was 6.0 percent in February, similar to forecasters' projections, and the PCE index was 5.0 percent in February, slightly below previous expectations. The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at its last meeting. The markets expect a potential interest rate decline around the middle of the year, and the expected peak of the current interest rate cycle is lower than it was at the beginning of the reviewed period. In the eurozone, the leading inflation figure for March surprised to the downside, with annual pace of 6.9 percent, compared with an annual pace of 8.5 percent in February. This decline was beyond what forecasters were projecting. In contrast, core inflation in the eurozone continued to increase. The ECB increased its interest rate by 50 basis points. In the UK, the moderating trend of inflation was halted, and inflation again increased to 10.4 percent, compared to forecasters' projections for continued moderation. The Bank of England increased its interest rate by another 25 basis points. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on April 17. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. May 22, 2023. [1] The analysis in this scenario is based on the quarterly model used to analyze business cycles and for the Research Department's forecasts published on a quarterly basis. Therefore, the forecast deals only with a range of three years. An analysis of the potential long-term effects must be based on a long-term economic growth model."
Chile,2023-04-04,"NoPtrae sds eR epleraesne s*a Tuesday, 4 April 2023 Monetary Policy Meeting  April 2023 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 11.25%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of its members. Up until early March, the international scenario presented improved global growth prospects and greater concern about inflation, particularly because core indicators remained high in several economies. In recent weeks, attention has turned to the financial health of some banks in developed economies. Authorities have taken various actions to contain the impact of these episodes. Overall, volatility and uncertainty about the future scenario are still substantial. Global financial markets have fluctuated significantly in the last month, reversing the better tone observed prior to the beginning of March. Thus, interest rates have decreased significantly, while stock markets and currencies have shown mixed movements, amid a lower appetite for risk. Compared to the January meeting, commodity prices have generally declined. Copper is trading at around US$4.1 per pound (‐3% since the last MP Meeting), while the oil price declined to US$79 per barrel (‐5% since the last MP Meeting for the WTI‐Brent average). In general, the local financial market has followed global market trends. Long‐term interest rates have declined in recent weeks. With ups and downs, the nominal exchange rate appreciated by around 11.5% with respect to the December Monetary Policy Report, partly due to the consolidation of the easing of domestic uncertainty. Regarding credit, the Bank Lending Survey for the first quarter of 2023 reports that both supply and demand remain tight. The usual revision of the National Accounts revealed a significant change in the composition of demand with respect to that published previously for the 2020‐2022 period. Consumption was revised up and investment was revised down. National savings were lower and the current account deficit were higher. Changes in GDP growth rates and levels were limited. In the shortest term, the data for the end of 2022 and the turn of 2023 show that the economy's adjustment process has been slower than expected. Discounting seasonality, the non‐mining Imacec for February rose 0.1%, with increases in trade and manufacturing activity. Meanwhile, in the fourth quarter, household consumption fell 0.7% with respect to the previous quarter (seasonally adjusted series), slowing its adjustment pace with respect to the immediately preceding quarters. The labor market shows increases in employment and participation, with unemployment rising to 8.4% nationwide. The perception of households and companies remains in pessimistic ground, despite some improvement over previous months. Inflation remains high. In February, headline and core inflation stood at 11.9% and 10.7% annually, respectively. While total inflation has declined, core inflation has been fairly constant for several months. Moreover, it has accumulated a significant upward surprise in recent months. Most measures of two‐years‐ahead inflation expectations remain above 3%. Nota de prensa The economy is adjusting more slowly than expected and inflation is taking longer to come down. In this context, the Board considers that it will be necessary to keep the MPR at 11.25% until macroeconomic conditions indicate that the process of inflation convergence to the 3% target has been consolidated. As described in the central scenario of the March MP Report, this process will take longer than expected in December. The Board reaffirms its commitment to act with flexibility in case any of the internal or external risks materializes and macroeconomic conditions so require. The MP Report due to be released tomorrow morning contains the details of the central scenario, the sensitivities and risks surrounding it, and its implications for the future evolution of the MPR. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Thursday, 20 April 2023. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will take place on Thursday 11 and Friday 12 May 2023 and the statement thereof will be released at 18:00 hours of the second day. The Spanish original prevails.

Romania,2023-04-04,"In its meeting of 4 April 2023, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual inflation rate went down to 15.52 percent in February 2023, from 16.37 percent in December 2022, relatively in line with forecasts. The decrease was mainly driven by the sizeable drop in the dynamics of fuel and electricity prices, under the impact of significant base effects and the change made to the energy price capping and compensation scheme starting 1 January 2023. At the same time, the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation slowed its rise somewhat more visibly than anticipated, to reach 15.0 percent in February, from 14.6 percent in December 2022, amid disinflationary base effects and falling prices of some commodities, especially agri-food items, as well as the downward adjustment of short-term inflation expectations. However, notable opposite influences continued to come from the gradual pass-through into consumer prices of increased costs of materials and wages, as well as from higher profit margins, in the context of the resilience of consumer demand, but also from the rise in the prices of some imported consumer goods. The annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP  inflation indicator for EU Member States) went down to 13.4 percent in February 2023 from 14.1 percent in December 2022. The average annual CPI inflation rate and the average HICP inflation rate continued however to go up, reaching 14.9 percent and 13.0 percent respectively in February 2023 from 13.8 percent and 12.0 percent respectively in December 2022, but remained below the levels prevailing in the region and the Baltic countries. Economic growth slowed down only mildly in 2022 Q4, to 1.0 percent from 1.2 percent in the previous three months (quarterly change), thus exceeding expectations yet again, which makes it likely for excess aggregate demand to pick up again over this period, contrary to expectations. In annual terms, economic growth stepped up to 4.6 percent in 2022 Q4, from 3.8 percent in the prior quarter, with the main contribution, for the second quarter in a row, from gross fixed capital formation, followed at a short distance by the contribution from household consumption. The impact of net exports remained contractionary, but decreased significantly against Q3, as the particularly large deceleration in the annual dynamics of the import volume exceeded that in the annual dynamics of the export volume of goods and services. Against this background, the annual increase in the trade deficit slowed down markedly, while that in the current account deficit decelerated by two thirds to a two-year low, inter alia following the improvement in the evolution of the secondary income balance, on account of inflows of EU funds to the current account. The latest data and analyses point to a more subdued slowdown in economic growth in 2023 Q1 than previously anticipated, implying however a pronounced deceleration versus the same year-earlier period, amid a base effect. Thus, the annual growth rate of retail sales, including motor vehicle and motorcycle trade, continued to pick up in January 2023, while that of services to households posted a decline. At the same time, industrial output saw a wider contraction in annual terms, whereas the volume of construction works recorded a considerably slower increase compared to the same year-earlier period. The annual changes in both exports and imports of goods and services saw large declines in the first month of 2023, with the former remaining however relatively higher, probably owing, inter alia, to the improved terms of trade. Consequently, trade deficit and current account deficit contracted significantly versus the same year-earlier period. The growth in the number of employees in the economy continued to lose pace in December 2022-January 2023, while the ILO unemployment rate posted only a very slight decline in January-February 2023, after its advance to 5.7 percent in 2022 Q4. At the same time, in 2023 Q1 the labour shortage reported by companies saw a re-intensification of the downward trend visible since 2022 Q3, whereas employment intentions fluctuated significantly during the first three months of the current year, mainly owing to frequent changes in expectations in a sector. The main interbank money market rates remained on a downward path in February-March, amid the excess liquidity in the banking system. However, the downward adjustment slowed and came to a halt towards the end of the period. At the same time, yields on government securities posted increases in February, which were fully corrected in March  in line with developments in advanced economies and in the region , against the backdrop of successive revisions in investor expectations on major central banks' prospective monetary policy stance, as well as of the turmoil created by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the US and by the situation of Credit Suisse. The leu further exhibited a strengthening trend versus the euro during this period, reflecting the high relative attractiveness of investments in domestic currency. In the closing days of March, the EUR/RON rose gradually, returning to the vicinity of the values prevailing in 2022 H1. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector continued to decelerate in the first two months of 2023, albeit more moderately, reaching 10.6 percent in February from 12.1 percent in December 2022, amid the slower decline in the dynamics of the leu-denominated component, alongside the quasi-halt in the uptrend of the high dynamics of foreign currency loans. The share of leu-denominated loans in credit to the private sector continued, however, to fall, standing at 68.3 percent in February 2023 from 68.8 percent in December 2022. According to current assessments, the annual inflation rate will probably fall at a faster pace over the following months, in line with the latest medium-term forecast (February 2023), under the influence of sizeable base effects and the downward corrections of some commodity prices, as well as amid the changes made to energy price capping and compensation schemes. Uncertainties are, however, associated with the presumed impact of the new setup of energy price capping and compensation schemes, while the balance of supply-side risks is slightly tilted to the upside at the current juncture, given inter alia the vegetable shortage in Europe and the oil output cuts announced by OPEC countries. At the same time, the war in Ukraine and the related sanctions continue to generate significant uncertainties and risks to the outlook for economic activity, hence to medium-term inflation developments, to which add those stemming from the turmoil in the banking systems in the US and Switzerland. All this could have adverse effects by affecting the economies of developed countries and the risk perception towards Central and Eastern Europe, with an impact on financing costs. Furthermore, the absorption of EU funds, especially those under the Next Generation EU programme, is conditional on fulfilling strict milestones and targets for implementing the projects. However, it is essential for carrying out the necessary structural reforms, energy transition included, as well as for counterbalancing, at least in part, the contractionary impact of supply-side shocks, compounded by the war in Ukraine and by the tightening of economic and financial conditions worldwide. Major uncertainties and risks are associated with the fiscal policy stance as well, given, on one hand, the public deficit target set for 2023 in order to continue budget consolidation amid the excessive deficit procedure and the significant increase in financing costs and, on the other hand, the packages of support measures implemented or extended this year, in a challenging economic and social environment domestically and globally, with potential adverse implications for budget parameters. Particularly relevant are the Fed's and the ECB's monetary policy decisions, which render capital flows unclear, as well as the behaviour of central banks in the region. In the meeting held today, 4 April 2023, based on the currently available data and assessments, as well as in light of the very elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 7.00 percent per annum. Moreover, it decided to leave unchanged the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 8.00 percent per annum and the deposit facility rate at 6.00 percent per annum. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to keep the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to bring the annual inflation rate back in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat target on a lasting basis, inter alia by anchoring inflation expectations over the medium term, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. At the current juncture, the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms, also by using EU funds to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand adverse developments. The NBR closely monitors developments in the domestic and international environment and will continue to use the tools at its disposal to achieve the fundamental objective of price stability in the medium term. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 18 April 2023 at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board will be held on 10 May 2023."
Poland,2023-04-05,"Warsaw, 5 April 2023 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 4-5 April 2023 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ▪ reference rate at 6.75%; ▪ lombard rate at 7.25%; ▪ deposit rate at 6.25%; ▪ rediscount rate at 6.80%; ▪ discount rate at 6.85%. Despite an improvement in some of the indicators in recent months, the global economic conditions remain weakened. In the euro area, forecasts indicate that GDP growth in 2023 will be low. At the same time, turmoil in the banking sector in the United States and Europe has increased uncertainty about global economic activity in the coming quarters. Inflation in the major advanced economies is declining. However, in most economies it remains high, driven by the lagged effects of the earlier supply shocks, including in the energy market, as well as demand factors and increasing labour costs. In recent months, prices of commodities have declined, which together with the easing of global supply chain disruptions reduces price pressure. This is reflected in systematically declining growth in producer prices. At the same time, core inflation remains high. In March 2023, the Federal Reserve of the United States and the European Central Bank increased interest rates. In turn, the central banks in Central and Eastern Europe  after earlier significant monetary policy tightening  are now keeping interest rates unchanged. Amid the weakening of economic growth around the world, activity has also slowed down in Poland. Monthly data for February 2023 indicate a fall in retail sales and industrial output in annual terms, accompanied by higher growth in construction and assembly output. Despite the slowdown in activity, the labour market situation remains good and unemployment is low. The number of working persons remains high, although annual growth in employment in the enterprise sector declined. According to Statistics Poland flash estimate. CPI inflation in Poland declined to 16.2% y/y in March 2023 following a rise to 18.4% y/y in February. The decrease in inflation in annual 1/2 terms compared to February 2023 was driven by a significant fall in growth of fuels and energy carriers prices alongside stable annual growth in prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages. At the same time, despite weakening demand growth, the level of inflation was still affected by a significant increase in costs resulting from an earlier strong surge in global commodity prices and disruptions in global value chains that was passed through to consumer prices. However, for several months commodity prices and growth of producer price index have been decreasing, which signals a gradual easing of external supply shocks. Together with the weakening economic activity, it will support a decline in domestic CPI inflation in the coming quarters. The Council assesses that the weakening of the external economic conditions, together with a decline in commodity prices, will continue to curb global inflation, which will contribute to lower price growth in Poland. The decline in domestic inflation will be supported by a weakening of GDP growth, including consumption, amid a significant decrease in credit growth. As a result, the Council assesses that the earlier strong monetary policy tightening undertaken by NBP will lead to a decline in inflation in Poland towards the NBP inflation target. At the same time, given the strength and persistence of the earlier shocks, which remain beyond the impact of domestic monetary policy, the return of inflation to the NBP inflation target will be gradual. The decrease in inflation would be faster if supported by an appreciation of the zloty exchange rate, which, in the Council's assessment, would be consistent with the fundamentals of the Polish economy. Further decisions of the Council will depend on incoming information regarding prospects for inflation and economic activity. NBP will continue to take all necessary actions in order to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability, including above all to bring inflation down to the NBP inflation target in the medium term. NBP may intervene in the foreign exchange market, in particular to limit fluctuations of the zloty exchange rate that are inconsistent with the direction of monetary policy."
India,2023-04-06,"Monetary Policy Statement, 2023-24 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) April 3, 5 and 6, 2023 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (April 6, 2023) decided to: Keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.50 per cent. The standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Global economic activity remains resilient amidst the persistence of inflation at elevated levels, turmoil in the banking system in some advanced economies (AEs), tight financial conditions and lingering geopolitical hostilities. Recent financial stability concerns have triggered risk aversion, flights to safety and heightened financial market volatility. Sovereign bond yields fell steeply in March on safe haven demand, reversing the sharp increase in February over aggressive monetary stances and communication. Equity markets have declined since the last MPC meeting and the US dollar has pared its gains. Weakening external demand, spillovers from the banking crisis in some AEs, volatile capital flows and debt distress in certain vulnerable economies weigh on growth prospects. Domestic Economy 3. The second advance estimates (SAE) released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on February 28, 2023 placed India's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 7.0 per cent in 2022-23. Private consumption and public investment were the major drivers of growth.2 4. Economic activity remained resilient in Q4. Rabi foodgrains production is expected to increase by 6.2 per cent in 2022-23. The index of industrial production (IIP) expanded by 5.2 per cent in January while the output of eight core industries rose even faster by 8.9 per cent in January and 6.0 per cent in February, indicative of the strength of industrial activity. In the services sector, domestic air passenger traffic, port freight traffic, e-way bills and toll collections posted healthy growth in Q4, while railway freight traffic registered a modest growth. Purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) pointed towards sustained expansion in both manufacturing and services in March. Amongst urban demand indicators, passenger vehicle sales recorded strong growth in February while consumer durables contracted in January. Among rural demand indicators, tractor and two-wheeler sales were robust in February. As regards investment activity, growth in steel consumption and cement output accelerated in February. Merchandise exports and non-oil non-gold imports contracted in February while the strong growth in services exports continued. CPI headline inflation rose from 5.7 per cent in December 2022 to 6.4 per cent in February 2023 on the back of higher inflation in cereals, milk and fruits and slower deflation in vegetables prices. Fuel inflation remained elevated, though some softening was witnessed in February due to a fall in kerosene (PDS) prices and favourable base effects. Core inflation (i.e. CPI excluding food and fuel) remained elevated and was above 6 per cent in January-February. The moderation observed in inflation in clothing and footwear, and transportation and communication was largely offset by a pick-up in inflation in personal care and effects and housing. The average daily absorption under the LAF moderated to ₹1.4 lakh crore during February-March from an average of ₹1.6 lakh crore in December-January. During 2022- 23, money supply (M3) expanded by 9.0 per cent and non-food bank credit rose by 15.4 per cent. India's foreign exchange reserves were placed at US$ 578.4 billion as on March 31, 2023. Outlook 8. The inflation trajectory for 2023-24 would be shaped by both domestic and global factors. The expectation of a record rabi foodgrains production bodes well for the food prices outlook. The impact of recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms, however, needs to be watched. Milk prices could remain firm due to high input costs and seasonal factors. Crude oil prices outlook is subject to high uncertainty. Global financial market volatility has surged, with potential upsides for imported inflation risks. Easing cost conditions are leading to some moderation in the pace of output price increases in manufacturing and services, as indicated by the Reserve Bank's enterprise surveys. The lagged pass- through of input costs could, however, keep core inflation elevated. Taking into account these factors and assuming an annual average crude oil price (Indian basket) of US$ 85 per barrel and a normal monsoon. CPI inflation is projected at 5.2 per cent for 2023-24, with Q1 at 5.1 per cent. Q2 at 5.4 per cent. Q3 at 5.4 per cent and Q4 at 5.2 per cent, and risks evenly balanced (Chart 1). A good rabi crop should strengthen rural demand, while the sustained buoyancy in contact-intensive services should support urban demand. The government's thrust on capital expenditure, above trend capacity utilisation in manufacturing, double digit credit growth and the moderation in commodity prices are expected to bolster manufacturing and investment activity. According to the RBI's surveys, businesses and consumers are optimistic about the future outlook. The external demand drag could accentuate, given slowing global trade and output. Protracted geopolitical tensions, tight global financial conditions and global financial market volatility pose risks to the outlook. Taking all these3 factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2023-24 is projected at 6.5 per cent with Q1:2023-24 at 7.8 per cent; Q2 at 6.2 per cent; Q3 at 6.1 per cent; and Q4 at 5.9 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). With CPI headline inflation ruling persistently above the tolerance band, the MPC decided to remain resolutely focused on aligning inflation with the target. It is essential to rein in the generalisation of price pressures and anchor inflation expectations. An environment of low and stable prices is necessary for the resilience in domestic economic activity to be sustained. While the policy rate has been increased by a cumulative 250 basis points since May 2022, which is still working through the system, there can be no room for letting down the guard on price stability. Taking these factors into account, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent in this meeting, with readiness to act, should the situation so warrant. The MPC will continue to keep a strong vigil on the evolving inflation and growth outlook and will not hesitate to take further action as may be required in its future meetings. All members of the MPC  Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma. Dr.Rajiv Ranjan. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das  unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Dr.Rajiv Ranjan.

Kazakhstan,2023-04-07,"The base rate remains unchanged at 16,75% April 7, 2023 Astana The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to keep the base rate at 16,75% per annum with the interest rate corridor +/- 1 pp. Global inflationary pressure, despite the inflation slowdown in some countries, remains elevated. In Kazakhstan, annual and monthly inflation in March showed an expected decrease. Despite the beginning of a slowdown in inflationary processes, it is too early to say about a steady and stable downward trend in inflation. Internal pro-inflationary factors persist and begin to be implemented in the form of unstable inflation expectations, increased government spending, and the beginning of implementation of overdue reforms in the fuel and lubricants, and housing and utilities market. The aggregate balance of factors continues to support the previous communication about the need to maintain the base rate at the current level during the first half of 2023 in order to reduce inflation in the medium term. Further actions on the base rate will depend on the updated forecast in May, taking into account new data, including the parameters of the reform in the fuel and lubricants, and housing and utilities market. Inflation has started to show a slowdown and corresponds to the forecast trajectory. In March 2023, annual inflation is expected to have decreased to 18,1% as a result of the high base of last year. At the same time, the slowdown in inflation was restrained by the growth of tariffs for regulated services in February and prices of fruit and vegetable products amid the crop losses and frosts in the southern regions, as well as an increase in the cost of transport services due to the increased demand. Monthly inflation after interruption of the decline in February 2023 (1,3% mom) in March showed a further deceleration to 0,9%. Nevertheless, it continues to form above the historical average (0,6% in March 2017-2021). The stable part of inflation also shows a slowdown, but still remains high, indicating the preservation of the pro-inflationary environment. Inflation expectations accelerated again after a decline in January-February. In March, the expected inflation in a year was estimated by respondents at 16,5% (in February  14,2%). Factors of inflationary expectations are changes in food prices, external events, changes in the exchange rate of tenge, as well as the growth of salaries and pensions. External inflation remains high despite the slowdown. World food prices have continued to decline, but are still above the average values over the past five years. In the USA and in the EU countries, high prices for food and services continue to contribute to high consumer inflation. The rhetoric of the US Federal Reserve and the ECB, despite the problems in the banking sector, remains quite tough. Moreover, the ECB expects inflation to remain high for a long time. As a result of the problems in the banking sector of the USA and Europe, which have increased the expectation of a global recession and weaker demand for raw materials, oil prices are forming lower than the baseline scenario of $88 per barrel on average in 2023. Nevertheless, oil prices will be supported this year by the planned reduction in production by OPEC+ countries, weak oil production in Russia due to sanctions, as well as the further recovery of China after the opening. Economic growth corresponds to the forecast of the National Bank of 3,5-4,5% for the year. Thus. Kazakhstan's economy grew by 4,3% in January-February 2023. Domestic demand remains stable, as evidenced by the positive dynamics of retail turnover as a result of the sale of cars, household appliances, food and clothing. Pro-inflation risks persist and are partially beginning to be realized. Volatile inflation expectations indicate an increased pro-inflationary background in the country. The risk of a possible inflation acceleration as a result of rising prices for previously regulated goods and services remains and partially begins to be realized. Along with this, a significant revision of the republican budget expenditures and the temporary suspension of the budget rule creates uncertainty and shifts the balance of risks to the pro-inflationary side. Despite the risks of inflation due to rising prices for fuel and regulated utilities, the reforms are overdue and are designed to reduce the accumulated imbalances in the economy in the medium and long term. Under these conditions, the National Bank continues to adhere to the position on the feasibility of maintaining the base rate at current values in the first half of 2023. This will support the beginning of a weakly pronounced slowdown in inflationary processes in the country, offset the growth of budget expenditures and prevent the anchoring of inflationary expectations at high levels. At the next decision on the base rate, an updated forecast will be presented based on the results of the May 2023 round. During the forecast round, new incoming data will be analyzed, including the expected more complete information on the parameters of the pricing reforms of regulated services and fuels and lubricants, and their direct and indirect impact on inflation. The next scheduled decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on May 26, 2023 at 12:00 Astana time."
South Korea,2023-04-11,"The bank of korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.50% for the intermeeting period. It is forecast that inflation will continue to be above the target level for a considerable time although it is projected to continue to slow, and uncertainties surrounding the policy decision are also judged to be high with increasing risks to the financial sector in major countries. The Board, therefore, sees that it is appropriate to judge whether the Base Rate needs to rise further while assessing the pace of inflation slowdown, financial stability conditions and developments in other uncertainties. The currently available information suggests that the recovery of global economic growth has been more favorable than expected, but economic downside risks have increased due to heightened risks in the financial sector in major countries since the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in the U.S. Global inflation still remains high while continuing its slowdown, and core inflation is declining at a relatively slow pace. In global financial markets, the volatility of major price variables has increased significantly, affected by risks to the financial sector and changes in expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy. As financial unrest has weakened expectations of tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the U.S, dollar has shown a downtrend after having strengthened until early March. Long-term market interest rates in major countries have also fallen significantly since mid-March, after having continued to rise. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected by the pace of global inflation slowdown, risks to the financial sector, monetary policy changes in major countries. U.S, dollar trends, and the recovery in the Chinese economy. Domestic economic growth has continued to slow with exports continuing to decrease significantly due to deepened sluggishness in the IT industry, although private consumption has somewhat recovered from its slowdown in the fourth quarter last year. Labor market conditions have generally continued to be favorable, but the decline in the increase in the number of persons employed has continued due to the economic slowdown. Going forward, domestic economic growth is expected to remain weak until the first half of this year, affected by the global economic slowdown and the Base Rate raises. From the second half of this year, it is expected to recover gradually with an easing of the sluggishness in the IT industry and the impact of the Chinese economic recovery. GDP growth for this year is projected to be slightly below the February forecast of 1.6%, but uncertainties regarding the outlook are judged to be high. Consumer price inflation has continued to moderate at 4.2% in March, declining from 4.8% in February. This is mainly because the decline in the price of petroleum products has widened and the sustained rise in the prices of processed food products has weakened. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) in March has run at 4.0%, the same as in February. Short-term inflation expectations among the general public have run at 3.9%, which is slightly lower than in February. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will continue to moderate and decline to the 3% range from the second quarter this year, owing to the base effect from the sharp rises in global oil prices last year and weakening pressure from the demand side. Consumer price inflation for this year is expected to be consistent with the February forecast of 3.5%. Meanwhile, it is judged that core inflation is likely to be somewhat higher than the February forecast of 3.0% for this year, considering its slow pace of decline recently. Uncertainty surrounding inflation forecasts is judged to be high regarding movements of global oil prices and exchange rates, the degree of economic slowdown at home and abroad, and the time and size of the increases in public utility fees. In financial and foreign exchange markets, major price variables have become more volatile, affected mainly by global financial market movements. Long-term market interest rates have shown a considerable increase along with government bond yields in major countries until early March, and then they fell significantly after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. The Korean won to U.S, dollar exchange rate has been fluctuating considerably, affected by trends in the trade balance, concerns about financial unrest in major countries, and weakening expectations of tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Household loans and housing prices have continued to go downward, but to a lesser extent. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over the medium-term horizon as it monitors economic growth, while paying attention to financial stability. Inflation is projected to remain high above the target level for a considerable time despite the slowdown of the domestic economic growth rate and inflation. Moreover, uncertainties surrounding the policy decision are judged to be high. The Board, therefore, deems it warranted to judge whether the Base Rate needs to rise further while maintaining the restrictive policy stance for a considerable time with an emphasis on ensuring price stability. In this process the Board will thoroughly assess the pace of inflation slowdown, the economic downside risks and financial stability risks, the effects of the Base Rate raises, and monetary policy changes in major countries. Opening Remarks to the Press Conference (April 11, 2023). Today, the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) of the Bank of Korea decided to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.50%. I will first go over financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, and then explain the background to today's Base Rate decision in detail. To begin, a look at the changes in external conditions since the February meeting shows that the global economy has faced greater economic uncertainties as the risks to the financial sector increased with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). In the U.S, and the euro area, which had shown a stronger-than-expected recovery until February, economic downside risks have risen since March, with greater risk to financial stability amid banking sector stress and with signs of a slowdown in labor markets. The Chinese economy continues to recover after the re-opening, driven by domestic demand, but its exports remain sluggish. Global inflation has slowed gradually from the previous high levels. However, core inflation has been sticky, declining at a slow pace in the U.S, and continuing to rise in the euro area. As for global financial markets, volatility of major price variables has heightened significantly, affected by risks to the financial sector and the changes in expectations for the U.S. The U.S, dollar, which had strengthened until early March amid expectations of further tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve, weakened considerably as the expectations subsided after the failure of SVB. Long-term market interest rates in major countries, which had sustained an uptrend, also fell significantly since March. Looking at the Korean economy, growth continues to slow, affected by the global economic slowdown and the accumulated Base rate hikes. Although the sluggishness in consumption has somewhat eased, as exports continued to decline significantly, growth in the first quarter is forecast to only turn slightly positive. GDP growth for this year is projected to be slightly below the February forecast of 1.6%, affected by the deepened sluggishness in the IT industry. Domestic economic growth is expected to remain weak until the first half of this year, but it is expected to improve gradually from the second half of this year, with an easing of the sluggishness in the IT industry and the impact of the Chinese economic recovery. Concerning inflation, consumer price inflation in March was still high at 4.2%, but it declined from 4.8% in February continuing its slowing trend since the second half of last year. This is mainly because the decline in the prices of petroleum products has widened due to the base effect of a surge in global oil prices last year, and the sustained rise in the prices of processed food products has begun to weaken. However, core inflation and short-term inflation expectations in March recorded 4.0% and 3.9%, respectively, staying the same or declining only slightly from the 4.0% of the previous month. Going forward, consumer price inflation is projected to sustain its slowing trend and decline to the 3% range in the second quarter, and reach around 3% at the year-end. Consumer price inflation for this year is forecast to be generally consistent with the February forecast of 3.5%. Meanwhile, it is judged that core inflation is likely to be somewhat higher than the February forecast path, given its slow pace of decline recently. However, there are still high uncertainties on the inflation forecast regarding global oil price movements in line with production cuts by oil-producing countries, the degree of economic slowdown at home and abroad, and the time and size of the increases in public utility fees. As for domestic financial and foreign exchange markets, the direct impact from the SVB failure has been limited, but the volatility of price variables has heightened affected by global financial market movements. The Korean won to U.S, dollar exchange rate has fluctuated at around the 1,300-won range due to a mixture of upside factors including greater risks to the financial sector in major countries and a continued trade deficit, as well as downside factors including weakened expectations of tightening by the U.S. Long-term market rates rose substantially until early March along with government bond yields in major countries, and they both fell after mid-March. Looking at household debt and the housing market, the decline in household loans and the fall in housing prices have continued, but the extent of the decrease has narrowed. The Board decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.50%. It is forecast that inflation will remain above the target level for a considerable time although it is projected to continue to slow. Also, uncertainties surrounding the policy decision are high with increasing risks to the financial sector in major countries. The Board, therefore judged that, while leaving the rate unchanged at the current level, it is appropriate to monitor the pace of inflation slowdown, financial stability conditions, and the development in other uncertainties. All the Board members supported the decision unanimously. Looking ahead, the Board deems it warranted to judge whether the Base Rate needs to rise further while maintaining the restrictive policy stance for a considerable time. This is attributable to the fact that inflation is still high and it is expected to remain above the target level throughout the year even if it continues to slow as currently forecast. It is too early to be relieved that prices will stabilize. In this process, the Board will operate monetary policy in a sophisticated manner while thoroughly assessing the pace of inflation slowdown, risks to the domestic and global financial sector, the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy operation, the impact of the Chinese economic recovery on the domestic economy, and the effects of accumulated Base Rate hikes."
Peru,2023-04-13,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT APRIL 2023 BCRP MAINTAINED THE REFERENCE RATE AT 7.75% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain the reference rate at 7.75 percent. This decision does not necessarily imply an end to the BCRP's monetary tightening cycle. Future reference rate adjustments will be conditional on new information about inflation and its determinants, including the macroeconomic effects of the political unrest of previous months. In March, month-on-month inflation was 1.25 percent and core inflation was 0.88 percent. Year-on-year inflation fell from 8.65 percent in February to 8.40 percent in March, while core inflation increased from 5.87 percent in February to 5.92 percent in March, both above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The significant increase in international food and fuel prices since the second half of 2021, accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in global inflation in magnitudes not seen in many years and towards levels significantly higher than the inflation targets of central banks, both in advanced and other economies in the region. In the Peruvian case, there were transitory inflation effects due to restrictions in the supply of some food and the heavy rains of the last month. A downward trend in year-on-year inflation is forecast to continue in the following months, with a return to the target range in the fourth quarter of this year, due to a moderation of the impact of international food and fuel prices, a reversal of agricultural supply shocks, and declining inflation expectations in the rest of the year. One-year-ahead expected inflation stood at 4.3 percent in March, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Various leading and expectation indicators for economic activity improved in March, but they remain in pessimistic territory. The outlook for global economic activity has moderated; however, global risks remain due to monetary tightening in advanced economies, international conflicts, and uncertainty in energy commodity prices. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants, including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, to consider, if necessary, changes in the monetary stance. The Board reaffirms its commitment to adopt the necessary actions to ensure the return of inflation to the target range over the forecast horizon. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 5.25 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 8.25 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months and the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months. In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates based on the amount of the operations. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on May 11, 2023."
Pakistan,2023-04-20,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement April , 2023. At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to increase the policy rate by 100 basis points to 21 percent. The MPC noted that inflation in March 2023 rose further to 35. percent, and is expected to remain high in the near term. However there are early indications of inflation expectations plateauing, albeit at an elevated level. The MPC views today's decision as an important step towards anchoring inflation expectations around the medium-term target, which is critical for achieving the objective of price stability. The Committee further observed that Pakistan's financial sector remains broadly resilient, while economic activity continues to moderate. Since the last meeting, the Committee noted three important developments having implications for the macroeconomic outlook. First the current account deficit has narrowed considerably, more than previously anticipated, mainly on the back of sizable import containment. Nonetheless the overall balance of payments position continues to remain under stress, with foreign exchange reserves still at low levels. Second significant progress has been made towards completion of the 9th review under the IMF's EFF program. Third recent strains in the global banking system have led to further tightening of global liquidity and financial conditions. These have added to the difficulties of the emerging market economies like Pakistan to access international capital markets. In this context, the MPC considers the current monetary policy stance appropriate, and stresses that today's decision, along with previous accumulated monetary tightening, will help achieve the medium-term inflation target over the next quarters. However the Committee noted that uncertainties attached with the global financial conditions as well as the domestic political situation, pose risks to this assessment. Real sector. The MPC noted that the incoming data on economic activity continues to reflect broad-based slowdown. In particular, there has been significant decline in sales volumes of automobiles and POL in recent months. Similarly the contraction in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) accelerated in January to. percent y/y. Cumulatively LSM output is down by. percent during Jul-Jan FY23 when compared with corresponding period of last year. Reflecting these trends, electricity generation declined for the ninth consecutive month in February. In agriculture, the information on cotton arrivals remains as per expectation; however, wheat production target is likely to be missed. These developments, combined with the lagged impact of the recent monetary tightening and new fiscal consolidation measures implemented since beginning of March, suggest growth in FY23 will be significantly lower than the post-floods assessment of November 2022. External sector. In February 2023, the current account saw deficit of only $74 million and the cumulative deficit now stands at $3. billion in Jul-Feb FY23, about 68 percent lower from the same period last year. This mainly reflects the contraction in imports, which continues to outweigh the combined decline in remittances and exports. Importantly workers' remittances have slightly recovered on m/m basis in February and the momentum is expected to continue in coming months. However despite the lower current account deficit, higher loan repayments relative to disbursements are keeping the foreign exchange reserves under pressure. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Thus, the Committee reemphasized that the early conclusion of the 9th review under the IMF program is critical to rebuild the FX reserve buffers. Fiscal sector. The MPC views that the fiscal outcomes during Jul-Jan FY23 have been encouraging in the context of achieving macroeconomic stability. The fiscal deficit was contained to. percent of GDP during Jul-Jan FY23 compared to. percent in the same period last year, while the primary balance posted surplus of. percent of GDP against deficit of. percent last year. This improvement in the primary balance was achieved on the back of lower subsidies, grants and development spending. Growth in tax revenues, however, has remained below target, amidst slowdown in economic activity, reduction in imports and inadequate policy focus on expanding the tax net, while debt servicing has increased. In this context, the Committee noted that delivering the envisaged fiscal consolidation is important to complement the ongoing monetary tightening in order to achieve price stability. Monetary and inflation outlook. Broad money growth showed slight uptick in February, primarily due to significant expansion in net domestic assets of the banking system. This was largely on account of higher public sector borrowing as growth in private sector credit decelerated sharply to 1. percent in February 2023 from 18. percent in February 2022. On monthly basis, private sector credit recorded contraction for the second consecutive month in February. This contraction was due to retirement in fixed investment and consumer loans, while working capital loans saw marginal seasonal uptick during the month. As the MPC had anticipated, national CPI inflation further rose to 35. percent in March 2023, resulting in average inflation of 27. percent during Jul-Mar FY23. The MPC noted that the surge in inflation was broad-based, though large part of it was contributed by food and energy components. This reflects the pass- through of increases in taxes and duties, unwinding of untargeted energy subsidies and the recent exchange rate depreciation. Importantly core inflation has risen to 18. percent in urban and 23. percent in rural baskets, indicating the second-round impacts of the above-mentioned adjustments. The Committee also viewed the increase in core inflation as partly driven by the elevated inflation expectations, as indicated by recent sentiment surveys. To anchor these expectations, the MPC views its current monetary policy stance as appropriate to keep the real interest rate in positive territory on forward-looking basis. Page."
Hungary,2023-04-25,"At its meeting on 25 April 2023, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 26 April 2023:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy, as well as its policy on environmental sustainability. The global economic outlook continues to be characterised by duality. In 2023, output growth is expected to slow in developed countries. In emerging countries, growth is likely to be similar to last year. In most countries, labour markets are tight. The Russia-Ukraine war and the persistently high inflation environment are posing downside risk to growth. The reversal of energy prices and the favourable level of gas storage facilities are mitigating the adverse effects of the energy crisis in Europe, which points to an improvement in the outlook for economic activity on the Continent. The turnaround in inflation has been emerging in an increasing number of countries. However, changes in core inflation indicators suggest that the fall in price indices in most countries might take longer than previously expected. The slowdown in global economic activity, the correction in global energy and commodity prices and the fall in international freight costs point to continued global disinflation. Investor sentiment has improved since the Monetary Council's last policy decision. Concerns about the US and European banking sectors have eased, and expectations for interest rate policies of the world's leading central banks have shifted back into focus. Communications from the Federal Reserve's (Fed) and the European Central Bank's (ECB) decision makers indicate that interest rate hikes are likely to be continued. Based on market expectations, interest rate increases by the Fed and the ECB might soon come to an end. In line with expectations, central banks in the CEE region have not changed monetary conditions. The Hungarian economy grew by 4.6 percent in 2022. High-frequency data suggest that the pace of economic growth generally slowed in the first months of the year. In February, the volume of retail sales and construction output fell significantly, while industrial production decreased to a smaller extent relative to a year earlier. The household confidence indicator has risen significantly in the past month but remains at a low level. The labour market remains tight, and the unemployment rate is low. The time profile and structure of domestic GDP is expected to be characterised by a duality this year. Output growth will be weighed down mainly by domestic demand factors. Economic growth is expected to pick up again from the second half of the year as inflation declines markedly and investment recovers. Both internal and external factors may make a positive contribution to growth in 2024. Domestic inflation peaked in January 2023. In March, annual inflation was 25.2 percent and core inflation stood at 25.7 percent. Inflation declined by 0.2 percentage point compared to the previous month. The slowdown in food and fuel price inflation continued. Compared to February, core inflation rose slightly, which was driven by one-off price increases linked to market services, particularly in the telecommunications sector. By contrast, within core inflation items the prices of durables decreased on a monthly basis. Inflation expectations continue to be elevated; however, corporate price expectations for retail sales and services have been slowing for months. The consumer price index is expected to decrease at an accelerating pace in the next months, which will also be supported by the growing impact of base effects from the middle of the year. Tight monetary conditions are expected to have broader disinflationary effects. The consumer price index will return to the central bank tolerance band in 2024. The fiscal deficit will continue to decline in this year. The deficit is projected to be 3.9 percent in 2023. Based on detailed data, the government debt ratio had decreased to 73.3 percent of GDP by the end of 2022, and it is expected to decline to 69 percent this year and close to 65 percent by the end of 2025. The external balance continued to improve. The current account deficit fell significantly in February 2023, bringing Hungary's financing balance back into surplus after more than a year. The trend-like improvement in the external balance has been driven by a decrease in the energy balance, more favourable terms of trade, the adjustment of domestic demand and the dynamic growth of exports. The current account deficit is expected to be halved this year. In parallel with a normalising global economic environment and the utilisation of new export capacities built recently, the trade balance and the net lending will continue to improve in 2024. In the Monetary Council's assessment, it is necessary to maintain tight monetary conditions in order to achieve price stability, and therefore the base rate was left unchanged at 13 percent at today's meeting. In the Council's evaluation, it is warranted to announce one-day deposit quick tenders and FX swap transactions at unchanged interest rate levels. The current level of the base rate is adequate to manage fundamental inflation risks. On 14 October 2022, the Monetary Council widened the interest rate corridor substantially in a turbulent financial market environment. In recent times, the risk environment, including Hungary's risk perception, has improved significantly, driven by external and internal factors. In response to the reduction in the risks of extreme scenarios, the Council has decided to narrow the interest rate corridor. Accordingly, the O/N deposit rate was left unchanged at 12.5 percent and the O/N collateralised borrowing rate was reduced to 20.5 percent. The transition to the revised reserve requirement system, which took effect from 1 April 2023, was smooth. The Bank will use the instruments to absorb interbank forint liquidity on a long-term basis in the coming period in order to strengthen monetary policy transmission. In the Monetary Council's assessment, it is necessary to maintain the current level of the base rate over a prolonged period, which will ensure that inflation expectations are anchored and the inflation target is achieved in a sustainable manner. Looking ahead, maintaining market stability and strengthening monetary policy transmission are also key to achieving price stability. The MNB is constantly assessing incoming data and developments in the outlook for inflation, and is closely monitoring the effects of international financial market developments on the domestic risk environment. The central bank will take into account the persistence of improvements in risk perceptions at the following policy meetings before making a decision to setting the interest rate conditions of overnight instruments."
Turkiye,2023-04-27,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 8.5 percent. Although recently released data point to a stronger economic activity than anticipated, recession concerns in developed economies as a result of geopolitical risks and interest rate hikes continue, and conditions threatening financial stability, triggered by successive bank failures, have emerged. While the negative consequences of supply constraints in some sectors, particularly basic food, have been alleviated by the strategic solutions facilitated by Türkiye, the high level in producer and consumer inflation continues on an international scale. The effects of high global inflation on inflation expectations and international financial markets are closely monitored. While the divergence in monetary policy steps and communications of central banks in advanced economies continue due to their diverse economic outlook, coordinated steps are taken that prioritize financial stability through swap agreements and new liquidity facilities. Financial markets have been adjusting their expectations that the central banks would end the rate hike cycles in the near term. Before the disaster of the century, leading indicators have been pointing to a stronger domestic demand compared to foreign demand as well as an increase in the growth trend in the first quarter of 2023. The impact of the earthquake on production, consumption, employment and expectations is being extensively evaluated. While the earthquake is expected to affect economic activity in the near term, it is anticipated that it will not have a permanent impact on performance of the Turkish economy in the medium term. Leading indicators show that the economic activity in the earthquake zone has been recovering faster than expected. While share of sustainable components of economic growth remains high, the stronger-than-expected contribution of tourism revenues to the current account balance continues throughout the year. On the other hand, domestic consumption demand, high level of energy prices and the weak economic activity in main trade partners keep the risks on current account balance alive. Sustainable current account balance is important for price stability. The rate of credit growth and allocation of funds for real economic activity purposes are closely monitored. As announced in the 2023 Monetary Policy and Liraization Strategy document, the Committee will continue to decisively use the tools supporting the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism and the entire policy toolset, particularly funding channels, will be aligned with liraization targets. The Committee will prioritize the creation of supportive financial conditions in order to minimize the effects of the disaster and support the necessary recovery. While level and underlying trend of inflation have been improved with the support of the implemented integrated policy approach, the effect of earthquake-driven supply-demand imbalances on inflation is closely monitored. It has become even more important to keep financial conditions supportive to preserve the growth momentum in industrial production and the positive trend in employment after the earthquake. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The Committee assessed that the current monetary policy stance is adequate to support the necessary recovery in the aftermath of the earthquake by maintaining price stability and financial stability. The effects of the earthquake in the first half of 2023 will be closely monitored. The CBRT will continue to use all available instruments decisively until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. The CBRT will implement Liraization Strategy in order to create an institutional basis for permanent and sustainable price stability. Stability in the general price level will foster macroeconomic stability and financial stability through the fall in country risk premium, continuation of the reversal in currency substitution and the upward trend in foreign exchange reserves, and durable decline in financing costs. This would create a viable foundation for investment, production and employment to continue growing in a healthy and sustainable way. The Committee will continue to take its decisions in a transparent, predictable and data-driven framework. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2023-04-27,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 25% per annum. This will support the effects of previous measures to improve attractiveness of hryvnia assets, help maintain sustainability of the FX market, and form proper conditions for the continuation of steady disinflation trend and for easing the most burdensome FX restrictions. Inflation is declining rapidly, including thanks to the NBU's measures to support exchange rate sustainability. However, the price pressure remains high because of the war. From the start of the year, inflation has been declining faster than expected. The growth in consumer prices decelerated to 21.3% yoy in March. The decline in the inflationary pressure was facilitated by sufficient supply of food and fuel and by a rapid recovery of the energy system from consequences of russia's terrorist attacks. An important factor was the improvement in inflation expectations from the start of the year on the back of ceased monetary financing, stronger hryvnia exchange rate on the cash market, and improved attractiveness of hryvnia assets, at which the NBU had been targeting its measures. However, the inflationary pressure remains high. The year-on-year decline in inflation was largely driven by the high base of last year and enhanced by the mild winter. On the other hand, businesses' production costs remain under pressure, in particular, due to difficulties of running business and setting up logistics during the war. Inflation will decelerate to 14.8% in 2023 and will return to a single-digit level in the next years. Inflation will continue to decelerate, including due to lower global energy prices, restrained domestic demand, and the effect of the NBU's monetary policy. Having considered the combined effect of the above factors and the situation in the energy sector, which was much better than expected, the NBU revised its 2023 inflation forecast, from 18.7% to 14.8%. Easing of price pressures in the coming years will primarily be contributed by a decrease in security risks, which is the main assumption of the NBU forecast. Under such conditions, inflation expectations are forecast to improve and supply of goods is projected to increase thanks to a recovery in optimal logistical routes and production capacity. Therefore, the NBU expects inflation to decline to 9.6% in 2024 and 6% in 2025. Already this year, the economy will return to growth, which will accelerate in the coming years on the back of a decrease in security risks assumed by the forecast. In view of the rapid recovery in the energy system and the loose fiscal policy, the NBU improved its economic growth forecast for 2023, from 0.3% to 2.0%. Provided that the assumptions about the security situation materialize, no significant shortages of electricity are expected, except for some local and situational shortages that might occur in H2. At the same time, an increase in budgetary spending on the back of large volumes of international financial assistance will support economic activity and consumption. Security risks starting to subside next year, as assumed by the baseline scenario of the NBU's forecast, will boost economic growth to 4.3% in 2024 and 6.4% in 2025. The de-occupation of territories and complete unblocking of Black Sea ports will enable a gradual increase in industrial production and crop harvests. Moreover, domestic demand is expected to increase thanks to the return of some of displaced persons. Net FX inflows to Ukraine continue thanks to large volumes of international assistance. The current account deficit is expected to be large in 2023. Among other things, this will be driven by an increase in imports on the back of a gradual recovery in domestic demand, a large number of migrants from Ukraine spending money abroad, and exports remaining modest due to weaker harvests and limited logistical routes. At the same time, inflows of international assistance will offset these factors. Overall, inflows from international partners could exceed USD 42 billion this year. The inflows from partners will, among other things, contribute to the growth in international reserves to about USD 35 billion as of the end of this year. This will strengthen the NBU's capability to further maintain exchange rate sustainability and gradually ease FX restrictions. Starting in 2024, rising export flows and the gradual return of forced migrants to Ukraine will help reduce the current account deficit, which will continue to be offset by substantial external official financing. This will maintain international reserves at a relatively comfortable level. Significant official financing, coupled with the further development of the domestic debt market, will prevent the need for monetary financing of a large budget deficit. Despite an increase in the government's tax revenues and domestic borrowing, these funds are not enough to finance the considerable expenditures of the state budget in wartime and during the post-war recovery. International assistance will remain an important source of financing to meet state budget needs. That said, after reaching a high this year, the deficit and official financing are expected to gradually decline from 2024. The key risk to this forecast is that the full-scale war lasts longer and is fiercer than anticipated. As before, the key assumption of the forecast is that high security risks will persist until early 2024. Longer-lasting and more intense hostilities could have a significant adverse effect on economic activity, while also worsening inflation and exchange rate expectations. This will pose additional challenges to the country's macrofinancial sustainability. The war is also generating other risks. the emergence of additional budgetary needs and substantial quasi-fiscal deficits in the energy sector difficulties with, or the halt in, the operation of the “grain corridor” and greater problems arising from the limitations imposed on imports of Ukrainian food by some European countries further damage inflicted by aggressor on energy infrastructure, which could again cause substantial power shortages, restraining economic activity and exports, and driving demand for imported equipment and energy and, consequently. FXa slower decline in global inflation than expected.Conversely, the rapid implementation of Ukraine's recovery project, together with European integration reforms, could significantly accelerate the pace of economic growth. The arrival of substantial financing for recovery could also provide Ukraine with greater opportunities for easing FX restrictions. Taking into account the risks outlined above, high uncertainty, and a significant amount of expected budget expenditures, maintaining exchange rate sustainability amid a pursuit of currency liberalization plans will require the NBU to continue to take a monetary policy approach that makes hryvnia-denominated savings highly attractive. With this in mind, the NBU Board decided to keep the key policy rate at 25%. Keeping the key policy rate at 25%, introducing additional instruments for preventing household savings from being eroded away by inflation, coupled with measures to increase competition among the banks for time deposits, contributed to greater exchange rate sustainability. These measures among other factors boosted demand for hryvnia instruments, while cutting demand for FX. This is evidenced, among other things, by the considerable strengthening in the hryvnia's cash exchange rate seen from the start of 2023, which had a positive effect on expectations, while also supporting a downward trend in inflation. At the same time, exchange rate sustainability is primarily being ensured by tight currency restrictions. Their effectiveness wanes over time, while their restrictive effect on business activity grows in intensity. It is therefore becoming increasingly desirable to liberalize FX restrictions in the foreseeable future. To this end, the NBU is making policy efforts to establish appropriate preconditions for an easing of FX administrative controls. With uncertainty still being high and the risks of current account balances growing further amid significant budget expenditures, the key prerequisite for preserving exchange rate sustainability and sustaining the decrease in inflation is to make sure that hryvnia savings are attractive. Which makes it necessary to keep the key policy rate at the level of 25% per annum. To maintain exchange rate sustainability, improve expectations, and steadily reduce inflation, the NBU will continue to sustain the needed monetary conditions. Keeping the key policy rate high will support the effects of the NBU's previous measures and leave room for further growth in the investment appeal of hryvnia savings. At the same time, the improved macroeconomic situation, including a deeper decline in inflation and the accumulation of a comfortable amount of international reserves, is creating prerequisites for revising the key policy rate forecast. The updated macro forecast envisages the launch of a cycle of key policy rate cuts in Q4 2023. Even if such a scenario materializes, monetary conditions will remain fairly tight over the forecast horizon as inflation continues to slow, inflation expectations improve, and real returns on hryvnia instruments remain high. The NBU stands ready to adjust the time and pace of changes in the key policy rate in view of FX market developments, inflationary dynamics, the sustainability of international support, and the effectiveness of measures to make hryvnia instruments attractive. The decision to keep the key policy rate, at 25% per annum, was approved by NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No. 161, dated 27 April 2023, which will come into effect on 28 April 2023. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 4 May 2023. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 8 May 2023. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 15 June 2023, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
Colombia,2023-04-28,"Four directors voted for this increase, two voted for keeping it unchanged and one director voted for a 50 basis points increase. In its policy discussion, the Board considered the following elements. Economic activity continues to decelerate, albeit at a slower pace than expected. The economic monitoring index (ISE) registered an annual change of 5.8% in January and 3.1% in February, while the GDP growth forecast for 2023 increased to 1%. Inflation in March remained relatively stable, as food inflation fell from 24.1% to 21.8% between February and March. Services have continued to exert upward pressure on inflation, as reflected in a 47 bps increase in core inflation excluding food and regulated items in March. Inflation expectations remain above target. Twelve-month expectations reported in the Monthly Expectations Survey decreased from 7.2% to 7.0% and remained at 5.0% by the end of 2024 for the median of the sample. The current account deficit would narrow from 6.2% of GDP in 2022 to an estimated 4.1% by yearend 2023, mainly as a result of lower domestic demand, which is reflected in a fall in imports. In the United States and the European Union, central banks once again increased their policy interest rates in an effort to address high inflation levels. Financial stability issues continue to pose significant risks for the global economy. The Board highlights Colombia's favorable assessment under Article IV of the IMF and the recent ratification that the country meets eligibility conditions for access to the Flexible Credit Line, an instrument available only to countries with sound macroeconomic policy frameworks. With the decision adopted in today's session, monetary policy maintains its goal of driving inflation toward the 3% target. Future decisions by the Board will be determined according to new information available. Fecha de publicacion."
Russia,2023-04-28,"On 28 April 2023, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 7.50% per annum. Current rates of price growth have increased since late 2022 but remain moderate, including in the stable components of inflation. Inflation expectations of households are down. They nevertheless remain elevated, as do businesses' price expectations. Economic activity is rising faster than the February forecast of the Bank of Russia assumed. This reflects both an expansion in domestic demand and the ongoing processes of transformation of the Russian economy. Accelerating fiscal spending, deteriorating terms of foreign trade and the situation in the labour market continue to pose pro-inflation risks. The overall balance of inflation risks has remained essentially the same since the previous Board meeting. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as the risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Given gradually rising inflationary pressures, the Bank of Russia's forthcoming Board meetings will consider the necessity of key rate increase to stabilise inflation close to 4% in 2024 and further on. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will come in at 4.56.5% in 2023 to return to 4% in 2024. Inflation movements. Annual inflation is down significantly from the high base; it was 3.5% in March (after 11.0% in February) and 2.5% as of 24 April. Current rates of price growth have increased since late 2022 and are largely about 4% on an annualised basis. Bank of Russia data show that the stable components of current price growth are so far below 4% on an annualised basis. The increase in current price growth rates was held back by a number of factors. On the one hand, they included an ongoing adjustment of the Russian economy to external trade and financial constraints. On the other hand, among them was a high level of inventories in a number of goods groups and essentially moderate consumer demand. Over this background, the weakening of the ruble since late 2022 has so far little shown in price dynamics. Inflation expectations of households and price expectations of businesses remain elevated, and their trends are diverging. In April, inflation expectations of households declined, whereas price expectations of companies went up. That said, there was an increase in the heterogeneity of trends in businesses' price expectations across industries: since the beginning of 2023, a notable drop in price expectations in agriculture has come with their increase in retail and wholesale trade. Analysts' medium-term inflation expectations are anchored close to 4%. Annual inflation will temporarily remain below 4% in the coming months under the influence of last year's high base effect. At the same time, the Bank of Russia forecasts that it will begin to grow gradually in the second half of 2023 as the low values of monthly price increases of summer 2022 exit calculations and the moderate levels of sustained inflation expand. According to the baseline scenario, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will come in at 4.56.5% in 2023, return to 4% in 2024 and will be close to 4% further on. Monetary conditions remain broadly neutral. Since the previous key rate review meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors, yields on short-term OFZs have slightly declined. Yields on medium- and long-term OFZs are little changed. Loan and deposit rates have been close to their levels of early 2023. Credit activity has been high overall, especially in the mortgage and corporate sectors. Unsecured consumer lending has grown at an accelerated pace. Meanwhile, banks have reported ongoing inflows of household funds to current accounts and deposits. Overall improvements in consumer sentiment and rebounding consumer lending signal the emergence of a gradual decline in the propensity to save from its increased levels. Economic activity. The economy is rising faster than the Bank of Russia's February forecast assumed. This reflects both an expansion in domestic demand and the ongoing processes of transformation of the Russian economy. Growing domestic demand is supporting an improvement in business sentiment despite persistently challenging external conditions. The current capacity to expand production in the Russian economy is largely limited by labour market conditions. Unemployment has dropped to a new historical low. Labour shortages are increasing in many industries amid the effects of the partial mobilisation as growth in businesses' demand for labour continues. In these circumstances, productivity growth can lag behind real wage growth. Changes in the aggregate demand structure continue amid the structural transformation of the economy. Consumer demand continues to recover, but it is still moderate. At the same time the overall contribution of fiscal policy to the expansion of aggregate demand is still increasing, including due to growing government investment. Taking into account new data on economic trends and the ongoing structural transformation of the Russian economy, the Bank of Russia's baseline scenario forecasts that GDP growth will be 0.52.0% in 2023 and 0.52.5% in 2024. This means that by the end of 2024 the Russian economy will reach the level of late 2021. In 2025. GDP will continue to grow at a rate of 1.52.5%. Inflation risks. The medium-term balance of risks has not significantly changed and remains tilted to the upside. Meaningful inflation risks are related to geopolitical tensions affecting foreign trade terms. As a result, increasing foreign trade and financial restrictions can further weaken demand for Russian exports, contributing to inflation through exchange rate movements. Moreover, the increasing complexity of production, supply chains and payments due to external restrictions could lead to both higher import prices and more severe supply-side constraints in the Russian economy. Given the volatility in the financial markets of advanced economies, a deterioration in the global economic growth outlook can also have significant short-term pro-inflation effects. The Bank of Russia's baseline scenario is based on the decisions already made regarding the medium-term expenditure path of the federal budget and the fiscal system as a whole. In case of a further expansion in the budget deficit, tighter monetary policy may be required to return inflation to target in 2024 and keep it close to 4% further on. Proinflationary risks from the labour market remain. Significant shortages of labour force in some industries may lead to labour productivity growth lagging behind growth in real wages. High and unanchored inflation expectations, which are particularly sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations, are also a source of risk. Under these conditions, the continuing growth of the most liquid assets in the structure of household savings may spur a rise in consumer demand in the future. A disinflationary risk for the baseline scenario is the continued high propensity to save amid increased general uncertainty as households take time to adapt to a new supply structure in consumer markets. A growing risk premium in bond yields and lending rates may additionally tighten monetary conditions, which will restrain lending. A disinflationary effect may also be caused by a faster economic transformation, accompanied by an active recovery of imports among other things. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic transformation processes, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Given gradually rising inflationary pressures, the Bank of Russia's forthcoming Board meetings will consider the necessity of key rate increase to stabilise inflation close to 4% in 2024 and further on. Following its Board of Directors' key rate meeting on 28 April 2023, the Bank of Russia publishes its medium-term forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 9 June 2023. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. Statement by Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina in follow-up to Board of Directors meeting on 28 April 2023.

Brazil,2023-05-03,"Copom maintains the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. The global environment remains challenging. The episodes involving banks abroad have increased the uncertainty, but with limited contagion on financial conditions so far, requiring constant monitoring. At the same time, the central banks of major economies remain committed to bringing inflation back to its targets, in an environment in which inflation has been resilient. Regarding the domestic scenario, the recent set of indicators of activity continues to be in line with the deceleration expected by Copom, although with more resilience observed in the labor market. Consumer inflation as well as the various measures of underlying inflation are above the range compatible with meeting the inflation target. Inflation expectations for 2023 and 2024 collected by the Focus survey have increased marginally and are around 6.1% and 4.2%, respectively. Copom's inflation projections in the reference scenario* stand at 5.8% for 2023 and 3.6% for 2024. Inflation projections for administered prices are 10.8% for 2023 and 5.2% for 2024. In an alternative scenario, with a constant interest rate throughout the relevant horizon, inflation projections stand at 5.7% and 2.9% for 2023 and 2024, respectively. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both directions. Among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation expectations, it should be emphasized a greater persistence of global inflationary pressures; the lingering uncertainty about the final fiscal framework to be approved by the National Congress and, more relevant for monetary policy, its impacts on the expected paths of the public debt and of inflation expectations, and on risky assets; and a larger or more persistent deanchoring of long-term inflation expectations. Among the downside risks, it should be noted an additional reduction in the prices of international commodities measured in local currency; a greater than projected deceleration of global economic activity, particularly due to adverse conditions in the global financial system; and a slowdown in domestic credit concession larger than what would be compatible with the current stance of monetary policy. On the one hand, the reinstatement of fuel taxes and, primarily, the presentation of a proposal for the fiscal framework have partly reduced the uncertainty arising from fiscal policy. On the other hand, the current scenario, characterized by a stage in which the disinflationary process tends to be slower in an environment of deanchored inflation expectations, requires further attention when conducting monetary policy. Copom emphasizes that there is no mechanical relationship between the convergence of inflation and the fiscal framework, and judges that the deanchoring of long-term inflation expectations raises the cost of the disinflation that is needed to reach the targets established by the National Monetary Council. In this scenario. Copom reaffirms its commitment to set monetary policy to meet the targets. Considering the assessed scenarios, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information. Copom decided to maintain the Selic rate at 13.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes the year of 2024. Without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price stability, this decision also implies smoothing economic fluctuations and fostering full employment. Taking into account the uncertainty of the scenarios, the Committee remains vigilant, assessing if the strategy of maintaining the Selic rate for a long period will be enough to ensure the convergence of inflation. The Committee emphasizes that it will persist until the disinflationary process consolidates and inflation expectations anchor around its targets. The Committee judges that the current scenario demands patience and serenity in the conduct of monetary policy. Copom emphasizes that, although a less likely scenario, it will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto de Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Diogo Abry Guillen. Fernanda Magalhaes Rumenos Guardado. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza and Renato Dias de Brito Gomes. * In the reference scenario, the interest rate path is extracted from the Focus survey, and the exchange rate starts at USD/BRL 5.05 and evolves according to the purchasing power parity (PPP). The Committee assumes that oil prices follow approximately the futures market curve for the following six months and then start increasing 2% per year onwards. Moreover, the energy flag is assumed to be ""green"" in December 2023 and 2024. The value for the exchange rate is obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average USD/BRL exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Colombia,2023-05-03,"Adjuntos. Determinantes de las Dinmicas de los Mercados de Capitales (Only Available in Spanish). Anexo estadstico (Only Available in Spanish). Le puede interesar. The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica decided to increase the monetary policy rate by majority vote by 25 basis points (bps) bringing it to 13.25%. Four directors voted for this increase, two voted for keeping it unchanged and one director voted for a 50 basis points increase. In its policy discussion, the Board considered the following elements. The slowdown in economic activity which was noticeable as of the fourth quarter of 2022 has continued through to the first months of 2023, albeit at a slower pace than expected. This can be identified in the economic monitoring indicator (ISE in Spanish), with a drop in the annual change from 5.8% in January to 3.1% in February. This trend is mirrored by other leading indicators such as energy demand, vehicle registrations, imports in dollars and the loan portfolio, which have been recording low and, in some cases, negative growth. Based on this information, the technical staff increased its GDP growth forecast to 1% for 2023, meaning that the economy continues to maintain the high output level reached in 2022, with a moderate expansion this year. The annual inflation in March remained relatively stable, at a level slightly above the 13% annual rate that has been noted since December. This behavior reflects in part the decline of annual food inflation, which between February and March fell from 24.1% to 21.8%, in a context of good supply and reduced import costs. Conversely, services such as health, transportation, and recreation, among others, have continued to push inflation upwards, which was reflected in the 47 bps increase in core inflation excluding food and regulated items seen in March. Nonetheless, annual producer price inflation, which contracted in March for the fifth consecutive month, indicates that cost pressures are easing and signals that consumer inflation will begin to decline in the coming months. Total inflation expectations for one-year and longer-term horizons have begun to fall but remain above target. The Monthly Expectations Survey (EME in Spanish) of economic analysts conducted by Banco de la Republica in April indicated that the median of twelve-month expectations fell from 7.2% to 7.0%, remaining at 5.0% for yearend 2024, with two-year ahead expectation at 4.0%. However, inflation expectations for yearend 2023 increased according to the survey, from 9.0% to 9.3% for headline inflation and from 8.7% to 9.4% for non-food inflation. The technical staff expects the current account deficit to narrow from 6.2% of GDP in 2022 to 4.1% by the end of 2023. The moderation of the external imbalance would primarily be attributed to a weakening in domestic demand, which is already noted in the drop in imports. Additionally, the declines in factor income seen would be less negative as profits remitted abroad by companies with FDI in Colombia would be lower. This is due in part because the 2022 tax reform increased the tax rates for oil and coal producing companies when international commodity prices exceeded a certain threshold, as was the case. The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank and the European Central Bank raised their policy interest rates again in the face of persistently high inflation levels, and slightly higher rates are now expected over the forecast horizon. The steeper cost of global financing, the erosion of real income due to high levels of global inflation and ongoing geopolitical tensions will continue to impact the world economy and could slow external demand. The extent of the risks from the recent bank failures in the United States and Europe continues to be relevant for the global economy. Colombia's favorable assessment under Article IV of the the IMF and the most recent ratification that the country meets eligibility conditions for access to the Flexible Credit Line, an instrument available only to countries with strong macroeconomic policy frameworks, is an acknowledgment of Colombia's prudent economic policy management and contributes to improving market confidence. Based on these considerations and other relevant issues regarding the current economic situation and its outlook, all members of the BDBR agreed on the need to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance to enable inflation to converge toward its target. Although the directors are confident that inflation will soon begin to ease, divergent opinions regarding the policy rate adjustment led four directors to vote in favor of a 25 bps interest rate increase, two directors to hold the rate unchanged, and one director voted for a 50 bps increase.The Directors with the majority vote acknowledge that policy rate increases effects on aggregate demand are becoming evident, as shown by the leading indicators mentioned above. However, they emphasize that inflation has not yet begun to decline, unlike in most Latin American countries. In particular, they point out that the core inflation continues to be high and on an upward trajectory. They underline that, although the measures of inflation expectations for terms above a one-year horizon show downward adjustments, those for yearend 2023 for both headline and non-food inflation continue high and on an ascendant path, which contributes to upholding price indexation mechanisms. Moreover, a member of this group stated that although there is a fiscal adjustment taking place, which contributes to reducing excess demand and the current account imbalance, there continues to be significant fiscal pressure which limits the opportunity for a less contractionary monetary policy. The Directors who voted to keep the policy rate unchanged, at its 13% level, consider this to already be a contractionary stance since its actual real level has been situated for several months above the neutral interest rate calculated by the technical staff. This stance has already had obvious effects by weakening aggregate demand and decelerating economic activity, as confirmed by numerous leading indicators. In these circumstances, they prefer to wait for the full impact that the 11.25 percentage point increase in the aggregate policy rate since September 2021 will have on the economy. In this regard, they recall that transmission lags in monetary policy changes are normal. Likewise, they highlight that, by 2023, a partial correction of external and fiscal imbalances is projected, which would lead to lower demand pressures. They emphasize that food inflation corrections have already begun and will possibly continue with the improvement in weather conditions that contribute to increasing the food supply. They emphasize that the observed decrease in the producer price index, both in its local and imported components, points to lessening cost pressures, which creates favorable conditions for consumer inflation to begin to decline. The Director who voted for a 50 bps increase highlights that headline inflation, as well as core inflation, remain elevated, while the latter continues to show significant increases such as those that occurred in March, when it rose 47 bps, driven by price indexation. This characteristic makes this core inflation measure less sensitive to interest rate increases. In this regard, he expressed concern about the behavior of non-food inflation expectations for the end of 2023. Furthermore, he noted that the current account deficit of 6.2% as a proportion of GDP at the end of 2022 and its projection of 4.1% for 2023 continues to be a considerable external imbalance, which requires hastening the adjustment process of the Colombian economy. In his opinion, a more gradual policy would result in a protracted period of high monetary policy rates that would undoubtedly impact the country's growth capacity. The Board of Directors highlighted that the decision adopted is consistent with the objective of driving inflation toward the 3% target over the forecast horizon and that future decisions will be determined according to new information available.

Malaysia,2023-05-03,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to increase the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 3.00 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly increased to 3.25 percent and 2.75 percent, respectively. The global economy continues to be driven by resilient domestic demand supported by strong labour market conditions, and a stronger-than-expected rebound of China's economy. Nevertheless, the global economy continues to be weighed down by elevated cost pressures and higher interest rates. Headline inflation continued to moderate, but core inflation has persisted above historical averages. For most central banks, the monetary policy stance is likely to remain tight. The growth outlook remains subject to downside risks, mainly from an escalation of geopolitical tensions, higher-than-anticipated inflation outturns, and a sharp tightening in financial market conditions including from further stress in the banking sector. For the Malaysian economy, latest developments point towards further expansion in economic activity in the first quarter of 2023 after the strong performance in 2022. While exports are expected to moderate, growth in 2023 will be driven by domestic demand. Household spending remains resilient, underpinned by better labour market conditions as unemployment continues to decline to pre-pandemic levels. The pickup in tourist arrivals is expected to lift tourism-related activities. Further progress of multi-year infrastructure projects will support investment activity. Domestic financial conditions also remain conducive to financial intermediation, with no signs of excessive tightening affecting consumption and investment activities. Risks to the domestic growth outlook are relatively balanced. Upside risks mainly emanate from domestic factors such as stronger-than-expected tourism activity and implementation of projects including those from the re-tabled Budget 2023, while downside risks stem from weaker-than-expected global growth and more volatile global financial market conditions. As expected, headline inflation trended lower in recent months on account of moderating cost factors. Both headline and core inflation are expected to moderate over the course of 2023, averaging between 2.8%  3.8%. However, core inflation will remain at elevated levels amid firm demand conditions. Existing price controls and fuel subsidies will continue to partly contain the extent of upward pressures to inflation. The balance of risk to the inflation outlook is tilted to the upside and remains highly subject to any changes to domestic policy including on subsidies and price controls, financial market developments, as well as global commodity prices. With the domestic growth prospects remaining resilient, the MPC judges that it is timely to further normalise the degree of monetary accommodation. With this decision, the MPC has withdrawn the monetary stimulus intended to address the COVID-19 crisis in promoting economic recovery. In light of the continued strength of the Malaysian economy, the MPC also recognises the need to ensure that the stance of monetary policy is appropriate to prevent the risk of future financial imbalances. At the current level, the monetary policy stance is slightly accommodative and remains supportive of the economy. The MPC will continue to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with the outlook of domestic inflation and growth. Bank Negara Malaysia 3 May 2023."
United States,2023-05-03,"EDT May 3, 2023 Economic activity expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 5 to 5-1/4 percent. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy. In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee (more)would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C Williams. Vice Chair; Michael S Barr; Michelle W Bowman; Lisa D Cook; Austan D Goolsbee; Patrick Harker; Philip N Jefferson; Neel Kashkari; Lorie K Logan; and Christopher J Waller. -0- For media inquiries, please email media@frb.gov or call 202-452-2955."
Euroarea,2023-05-04,"Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. In light of the ongoing high inflation pressures, the Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Overall, the incoming information broadly supports the assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook that we formed at our previous meeting. Headline inflation has declined over recent months, but underlying price pressures remain strong. At the same time, our past rate increases are being transmitted forcefully to euro area financing and monetary conditions, while the lags and strength of transmission to the real economy remain uncertain. Our future decisions will ensure that the policy rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our policy rate decisions will continue to be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The key ECB interest rates remain our primary tool for setting the monetary policy stance. In parallel, we will keep reducing the Eurosystem's asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio at a measured and predictable pace. In line with these principles, the Governing Council expects to discontinue the reinvestments under the APP as of July 2023. The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website. I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. The euro area economy grew by 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, according to Eurostat's preliminary flash estimate. Lower energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and fiscal policy support for firms and households have contributed to the resilience of the economy. At the same time, private domestic demand, especially consumption, is likely to have remained weak. Business and consumer confidence have recovered steadily in recent months but remain weaker than before Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine and its people. The manufacturing sector is working through a backlog of orders, but its prospects are worsening. The services sector is growing more strongly, especially owing to the reopening of the economy. Household incomes are benefiting from the strength of the labour market, with the unemployment rate falling to a new historical low of 6.5 per cent in March. Employment has continued to grow and total hours worked exceed pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, the average number of hours worked remains somewhat below its pre-pandemic level and its recovery has stalled since mid-2022. As the energy crisis fades, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and in a concerted manner to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a stronger monetary policy response. Fiscal policies should be oriented towards making our economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area's supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, can also help reduce price pressures in the medium term. In this regard, we welcome the publication of the European Commission's legislative proposals for the reform of the EU's economic governance framework, which should be concluded soon. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, inflation was 7.0 per cent in April, after having dropped from 8.5 per cent in February to 6.9 per cent in March. While base effects led to some increase in energy price inflation, from -0.9 per cent in March to 2.5 per cent in April, the rate stands far below those recorded after the start of Russia's war against Ukraine. Food price inflation remains elevated, however, standing at 13.6 per cent in April, after 15.5 per cent in March. Inflation excluding energy and food was 5.6 per cent in April, having edged down slightly compared with March to return to its February level. Non-energy industrial goods inflation fell to 6.2 per cent in April, from 6.6 per cent in March, when it declined for the first time in several months. But services inflation increased to 5.2 per cent in April, from 5.1 per cent in March. Inflation is still being pushed up by the gradual pass-through of past energy cost increases and supply bottlenecks. In services, especially, it is still being pushed higher also by pent-up demand from the reopening of the economy and by rising wages. The information available up to March suggests that indicators of underlying inflation remain high. Wage pressures have strengthened further as employees, in a context of a robust labour market, recoup some of the purchasing power they have lost as a result of high inflation. Moreover, in some sectors firms have been able to increase their profit margins on the back of mismatches between supply and demand and the uncertainty created by high and volatile inflation. Although most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent, some indicators have edged up and warrant continued monitoring. Renewed financial market tensions, if persistent, would pose a downside risk to the outlook for growth as they could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected and dampen confidence. Russia's war against Ukraine also continues to be a significant downside risk to the economy. However, the recent reversal of past adverse supply shocks, if sustained, could spur confidence and support higher growth than currently expected. The continued resilience of the labour market, by bolstering household confidence and spending, could also lead to higher growth than anticipated. There are still significant upside risks to the inflation outlook. These include existing pipeline pressures that could send retail prices higher than expected in the near term. Moreover. Russia's war against Ukraine could again push up the costs of energy and food. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. Recent negotiated wage agreements have added to the upside risks to inflation, especially if profit margins remain high. The downside risks include renewed financial market tensions, which could bring inflation down faster than projected. Weaker demand, due for example to a more marked slowing of bank lending or a stronger transmission of monetary policy, would also lead to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term. The euro area banking sector has proved resilient in the face of the financial market tensions that arose ahead of our last meeting. Our policy rate increases are being transmitted strongly to risk-free interest rates and to the financing conditions for firms, households and banks. For firms and households, loan growth has weakened owing to higher borrowing rates, tighter credit supply conditions and lower demand. Our latest bank lending survey reported a tightening of overall credit standards, which was stronger than banks had expected in the previous round and suggests that lending may weaken further. Weak lending has meant that money growth has also continued to decline. Summing up, the inflation outlook continues to be too high for too long. In light of the ongoing high inflation pressures, the Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Overall, the incoming information broadly supports the assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook that we formed at our previous meeting. Headline inflation has declined over recent months, but underlying price pressures remain strong. At the same time, our past rate increases are being transmitted forcefully to euro area financing and monetary conditions, while the lags and strength of transmission to the real economy remain uncertain. Our future decisions will ensure that the policy rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our policy rate decisions will continue to be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission."
Georgia,2023-05-10,"10.05.2023 The National Bank of Georgia has decreased its monetary policy rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 10.50 percent. On May 10, 2023, the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) decided to decrease the monetary policy rate (the refinancing rate) by 0.5 percent. The monetary policy rate stands at 10.50 percent. Inflation in Georgia is on a downward trajectory and in April the headline inflation dropped to 2.7 percent, while core inflation falling to 4.7 percent. The decline in inflation is mostly driven by the reduced prices of imported products; since mid-2022, prices on international commodity markets have gradually declined, and international shipping costs have gone down to their pre-pandemic levels. These trends, alongside the appreciated exchange rate, have been gradually transmitting to the local market and reducing imported inflation. Hence, inflationary pressures coming from international markets have been neutralized. Domestic inflation is also declining even if at a relatively slow speed and is expected to keep this downward trend throughout the year. Taking into account all of the aforementioned factors, inflation expectations have also been decelerating. This year, according to the NBG's forecast, economic growth will be close to the potential level, at around 5 percent. Therefore, demand side pressures on prices are not to be expected, aided by both tight monetary policy, which moderated credit growth compared to the previous year, and fiscal consolidation. Other things equal, in the short term the annual inflation rate is expected to decline further below the target and stabilize at around 3% in the medium term. After a prolonged period of high inflation, inflation being below the target in the short run will help further normalization of long-term inflation expectations. The latter, in turn, is a prerequisite for price stability. Accordingly, taking into account both the inflation trends and the forecast, the NBG has begun a gradual exit from tight monetary policy. However, it should be noted that despite the positive trends uncertainty is still high. At this stage there are no clear signs of a wage-price spiral developing. Nevertheless, unit labor costs have increased, and thus inflationary pressure from the labor market is still noteworthy. At the same time, the geopolitical tension remains one of the main risks. Therefore, under such uncertain circumstances, it is expected that the NBG will continue to reduce the monetary policy rate only at a slow pace. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on June 21, 2023."
Romania,2023-05-10,"In its meeting of 10 May 2023, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual inflation rate fell significantly in March 2023, down to 14.53 percent from 15.52 percent in February, mainly amid the drop in fuel prices against the same year-ago period. Thus, in the first three months of 2023 overall, the annual inflation rate declined considerably (from 16.37 percent in December 2022), posting the first contraction in nine quarters, in line with expectations. The decrease was mainly driven by the sizeable drop in the dynamics of fuel and electricity prices, under the impact of significant base effects and the change made to the energy price capping and compensation scheme starting 1 January 2023. At the same time, the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate halted its rise in Q1, reflecting its lower-than-expected advance in the first two months of the year and the March decline to the December 2022 level, i.e. 14.6 percent, amid disinflationary base effects, falling commodity prices, especially for agri-food items, as well as the downward adjustment of short-term inflation expectations. These fully offset the opposite influences that continued to come in Q1 from the gradual pass-through of increased costs of materials and wages into consumer prices, as well as from the preserved profit margins, in the context of the resilience of consumer demand, but also from the hike in the prices of some imported consumer goods. The annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP  inflation indicator for EU Member States) went down to 12.1 percent in March 2023 from 14.1 percent in December 2022. The average annual CPI inflation rate and the average HICP inflation rate continued however to go up in 2023 Q1, reaching 15.3 percent and 13.2 percent respectively in March 2023 from 13.8 percent and 12.0 percent respectively in December 2022, but remained below the levels prevailing in the region and the Baltic countries. The new statistical data reconfirm the stronger-than-expected economic growth in 2022 Q4 too, at a quarterly pace only mildly slower than in Q3, i.e. 1.0 percent compared to 1.2 percent, implying a new pick-up in excess aggregate demand during this period. In addition, data reconfirm the step-up in the annual GDP dynamics to 4.5 percent in 2022 Q4 from 3.7 percent in the previous quarter. According to the new data, the main contribution to economic growth came during this period from household consumption, followed at a short distance by the contribution from gross fixed capital formation. Furthermore, the impact of net exports remained only marginally contractionary, as the large deceleration in the dynamics of the import volume recorded in this quarter exceeded that in the dynamics of the export volume of goods and services. Against this background, the annual rate of increase of the trade deficit halved, while that of the current account deficit posted an even stronger decline, inter alia following the improvement in the evolution of the secondary income balance, on account of inflows of EU funds to the current account. The latest data and analyses point to a subdued slowdown in economic growth in 2023 Q1 and Q2, implying a mild deceleration in the first three months of the current year versus the same year-ago period. Thus, in January-February 2023, retail trade and especially services to households continued to post a robust increase compared to the same year-ago period, motor vehicles and motorcycles sales gained further momentum, while industrial output saw a wider contraction and the volume of construction works recorded a considerably slower advance. Moreover, the annual change in the exports of goods and services exceeded that of imports, which saw a much steeper decline in the first two months of the year, probably owing, inter alia, to the improved terms of trade. Consequently, trade deficit and current account deficit narrowed significantly versus the same year-ago period. The growth in the number of employees in the economy lost further momentum in January-February 2023, but the ILO unemployment rate receded to 5.4 percent in March, after its pick-up to 5.7 percent in 2022 Q4, while the particularly fast annual dynamics of unit labour costs in industry continued to accelerate. At the same time, the April surveys indicate a swifter decrease in the labour shortage reported by companies, but also an improvement in employment intentions in the near future. The main interbank money market rates slowed their downward adjustment in April, while yields on government securities witnessed only small fluctuations  relatively in line with developments in advanced economies and in the region , under the influence of successive revisions in investor expectations on the Fed's prospective monetary policy stance, amid the banking system turmoil. The EUR/RON exchange rate stuck in April to slightly lower values than those prevailing in 2022 H1, reflecting the high relative attractiveness of investments in domestic currency. Moreover, the leu strengthened significantly versus the US dollar, as the latter resumed its depreciation trend against the euro. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector slowed its decrease more visibly in March, reaching 10.2 percent from 10.6 percent in February, as the new moderate loss of momentum of the leu-denominated component was accompanied by the mild steepening in the uptrend of the particularly high dynamics of foreign currency loans. Therefore, the share of leu-denominated loans in credit to the private sector continued to fall relatively swiftly, diminishing to 67.8 percent in March from 68.3 percent in February. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the May 2023 Inflation Report, which incorporates the latest available data and information. The updated forecast broadly reconfirms the coordinates of the previous medium-term projection. Specifically, the annual inflation rate will probably remain on a downward path almost similar to that envisaged earlier, dropping to a one-digit level in 2023 Q3 and staying near the variation band of the target at the end of the projection horizon. The decrease will be further driven by supply-side factors, especially by disinflationary base effects and downward corrections of some commodity prices. To these add the presumed impact of energy price capping schemes, as well as the influences expected from the prospective narrowing of the positive output gap, albeit slower than in the previous projection, implying its closing at the end of the forecast horizon. At the same time, significant uncertainties and risks to the outlook for economic activity, hence to medium-term inflation developments, stem further from the war in Ukraine and the related sanctions, but also from the turmoil in the banking systems in the US and Switzerland. All this could have adverse effects primarily by affecting the economies of developed countries and the financing costs in Central and Eastern Europe. Furthermore, the absorption of EU funds, especially those under the Next Generation EU programme, is conditional on fulfilling strict milestones and targets for implementing the projects. However, it is essential for carrying out the necessary structural reforms, energy transition included, as well as for counterbalancing, at least in part, the contractionary impact of supply-side shocks, compounded also by the tightening of economic and financial conditions worldwide. Heightened uncertainties and risks are, nevertheless, associated with the fiscal policy stance, given on one hand the public deficit target set for 2023 in order to continue budget consolidation amid the excessive deficit procedure and the significant increase in financing costs and, on the other hand, the characteristics of the budget execution in the first months of the year, as well as the packages of support measures implemented or extended this year, in a challenging economic and social environment domestically and globally, with potential adverse implications for final budget parameters. The Fed's and the ECB's monetary policy decisions, as well as the stance of central banks in the region continue to be relevant. In the meeting held today, 10 May 2023, based on the currently available data and assessments, as well as in light of the very elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 7.00 percent per annum. Moreover, it decided to leave unchanged the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 8.00 percent per annum and the deposit facility rate at 6.00 percent per annum. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to keep the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to bring the annual inflation rate back in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point flat target on a lasting basis, inter alia by anchoring inflation expectations over the medium term, in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. At the current juncture, the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms, also by using EU funds to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand adverse developments. The NBR closely monitors developments in the domestic and international environment and will continue to use the tools at its disposal to achieve the fundamental objective of price stability in the medium term. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 12 May 2023 at 11:00 a.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 22 May 2023 at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board will be held on 5 July 2023."
Peru,2023-05-11,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT MAY 2023 BCRP MAINTAINED THE REFERENCE RATE AT 7.75% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain the reference rate at 7.75 percent. This decision does not necessarily imply an end to the BCRP's monetary tightening cycle. Future reference rate adjustments will be conditional on new information about inflation and its determinants. In April, month-on-month inflation was 0.56 percent and core inflation was 0.20 percent. Year-on-year inflation fell from 8.40 percent in March to 7.97 percent in April, while core inflation decreased from 5.92 percent in March to 5.66 percent in April, both above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The significant increase in international food and fuel prices since the second half of 2021, accentuated by international conflicts, has led to a sharp increase in global inflation in magnitudes not seen in many years and towards levels significantly higher than the inflation targets of central banks, both in advanced and other economies in the region. In the Peruvian case, there were transitory inflation effects due to restrictions in the supply of some food items and heavy rainfall in March. The downward trend in year-on-year inflation is forecast to continue in the following months, with a return to the target range in the fourth quarter of this year, due to a moderation of the impact of international food and fuel prices, a reversal of agricultural supply shocks, and declining inflation expectations in the rest of the year. One-year-ahead expected inflation decreased from 4.30 percent in March to 4.25 percent in April, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The leading and expectations indicators for economic activity reflect conditions similar to those in the previous month, with the majority persisting in pessimistic territory. The outlook for global economic activity has moderated; however, global risks remain due to monetary tightening in advanced economies and international conflicts. The Board is particularly attentive to new information on inflation and its determinants, including the evolution of inflation expectations and economic activity, to consider, if necessary, changes in the monetary stance. The Board reaffirms its commitment to adopt the necessary actions to ensure the return of inflation to the target range over the forecast horizon. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 5.25 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 8.25 percent per year for the first 10 operations in the last 3 months and the interest rate set by the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee for operations in addition to these 10 operations in the last 3 months. In addition, the Monetary and Exchange Operations Committee may establish higher rates based on the amount of the operations. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on June 8, 2023."
Chile,2023-05-12,"NoPtrae sds eR epleraesne s*a Friday, 12 May 2023 Monetary Policy Meeting  May 2023 In its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 11.25%. The decision was adopted with the unanimous vote of its members. Inflation has declined in several economies. However, core indicators remain high, signaling risks around their convergence. The main central banks raised their benchmark rates again. In this context, the Federal Reserve has hinted at a possible pause, while the European Central Bank has indicated that there are some further hikes ahead. The global growth outlook for this year remains weak. International financial conditions have shown no major changes in the last month, despite still high uncertainty regarding the global scenario. It is worth noting that there are concerns about the performance of the world economy and, in the developed world, about the potential vulnerabilities of some banks and the evolution of credit. In this context, since the last meeting, currencies have appreciated against the dollar and stock markets have risen slightly. Long-term interest rates have generally shown limited increases in developed economies and decreases in emerging ones. Commodity prices have dropped. Compared to the last meeting, oil prices fell slightly more than 8%, a drop that is around 5.5% for copper prices. In the local financial market, the nominal exchange rate is somewhat lower than at the last Meeting, while the IPSA has risen. Long-term interest rates have seen moderate increases. Bank credit remains contained. Preliminary first-quarter figures —based on the Imacec— show that, beyond the poor performance of mining, economic activity was in line with expectations in the March Monetary Policy Report. On the demand side, consumption-related indicators have continued to adjust downwards, while investment numbers confirm its weakness. In the labor market, the unemployment rate grew to 8.8% in the moving quarter ended in March, explained by, among other factors, lower employment and an increased labor force. Real wages continue to recover. In this context, the perception of the economy by businesses and households remains on pessimistic ground. Headline and core inflation have evolved in line with forecasts in the March MP Report. In April, the annual variation of the CPI dropped to 9.9%. The core component also showed a decrease in its annual variation (10.3% in April), although by less than total inflation. Most measures of two-year inflation expectations continue to place it above 3%. Consistent with a scenario aligned with the Bank's forecasts, the Board considers it appropriate to maintain the MPR at 11.25% until the state of the macro-economy indicates that the process of inflation convergence to the 3% target has been consolidated. At the same time, it reaffirms its commitment to act with flexibility in the event that any of the internal or external risks materializes and macroeconomic conditions so require.

Philippines,2023-05-17,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility at 6.25 percent. Accordingly, the interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were kept at 5.75 percent and 6.75 percent, respectively. Based on the sum of new information and its assessment of the impact of previous monetary policy actions, the Monetary Board decided that a pause in monetary policy tightening was appropriate. The BSP's latest baseline projections continue to reflect a gradual return of inflation to the target band of 2 4 percent over the policy horizon. Average inflation for 2023 is now projected to settle at 5.5 percent, lower than 6.0 percent previously, while the average inflation forecast for 2024 fell slightly to 2.8 percent. Meanwhile, inflation expectations for 2024 and 2025 are steady and within the target range. The Monetary Board also noted that while GDP growth has remained robust in the first quarter of 2023, demand indicators have also pointed to a potential moderation in the recent months, suggesting that previous policy rate increases by the BSP continue to work their way through the economy. Moreover, the Monetary Board is encouraged by the recent mounting of whole-of-government actions to ease constraints on food supply. Nevertheless, even as headline inflation has continued to decelerate with slower increases in the prices of food and energy-related items, core inflation has only eased marginally. In addition, the balance of risks to the inflation outlook remains largely tilted towards the upside owing to persistent constraints in the supply of key food items, the potential impact of El Niño on food prices and utility rates, as well as the effects of possible additional adjustments in transportation fares and wages. Meanwhile, the impact of a weaker-than-expected global economic recovery continues to be the primary downside risk to the outlook. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board deems it prudent for the BSP to take a pause in monetary policy tightening while remaining ready to respond to emerging threats to inflation. The Monetary Board also deems it necessary to keep the policy interest rate at its current level over the near term, as ongoing price pressures continue to warrant close monitoring. A prudent pause also allows monetary authorities to further assess how macroeconomic and financial conditions will evolve in view of tighter global financial conditions. Moving forward, the BSP will continue to monitor developments affecting the outlook for inflation and growth. The BSP stands ready to resume monetary tightening as necessitated by emerging data, consistent with its primary mandate to promote price and financial stability."
Egypt,2023-05-18,"Press Release  May 18th, 2023 MPC decided to keep key policy rates unchanged In its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 1825 percent, 1925 percent, and 1875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1875 percen. On the global front, forecasts for key international commodity prices have been revised downwards compared to those underlying the previous MPC meetin. Global inflationary pressures have also eased as a result of a mix of factors, most notably the monetary policy tightening on the part of major central banks, the declining energy prices, and a reduction in global supply bottleneck. Similarly forecasts for economic growth have broadly stabilized, while volatility in financial conditions of key advanced economies has eased compared to the previous MPC meetin. Domestically growth of real economic activity eased to 39 percent in 2022 Q4 compared to 44 percent in 2022 Q3, indicating that growth during the first half of fiscal year 2022/23 registered 42 percen. Detailed sectoral data for 2022 Q3 show that growth was primarily driven by private sector economic activity, specifically tourism, agriculture and trad. Additionally most leading indicators point towards a slowdown of real GDP growth in 2023 Q1. In line with the early signs of economic activity slowdown, broad money (M2) and its local currency components grew at a slower pace in March 202. Going forward, real GDP growth is expected to slowdown in fiscal year 2022/23 compared to the previous fiscal year, before recovering thereafte. Meanwhile the unemployment rate recorded 72 percent in 2022 Q4, down from 74 percent in the preceding quarte. This was mainly attributed to an increase in employment compared to the previous quarte. Annual urban headline inflation decelerated to record 306 percent in April 2023, compared to 327 percent in March 2023, marking the first deceleration since June 202. Meanwhile annual core inflation decelerated for the second consecutive month in April 2023 to record 386 percent, breaking its upward trend that lasted since mid 202. The recent deceleration in both annual headline and core inflation is primarily attributed to favorable base effects as well as the ease of major inflationary shocks; such as the domestic supply chain disruptions that affected main core food commodities and the repercussions of the exchange rate development. Economic developments following the last MPC meeting were broadly in line with expectation. The MPC continues to assess the impact of the cumulative policy rate hikes of 1000 bps since March 2022 in addition to the 400 bps increase in the required reserve ratio in September 2022, to contain inflationary pressures in a data-driven manne. In light of the above, the MPC decided to keep policy rates unchange. The MPC reiterates that the path of future policy rates remains a function of forecasted inflation rather than prevailing inflation rates and notes that achieving a tight monetary stance is a necessary condition to attain the CBE's upcoming inflation targets of 7 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2024 Q4 and 5 percent (± 2 percentage points) on average by 2026 Q4. The Committee is closely tracking the inflation risks that may arise from possible supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions, among other factor. The MPC will continue to monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance in line with its price stability mandat. Monetary Policy Sector monetarypolicy@cbeorge."
Mexico,2023-05-18,"Headline inflation continued decreasing in most economies. Nevertheless, it still remains at high levels. The core component has shown a resistance to decline. International financial markets have stabilized after the turbulence generated by the banking industry's events in previous months, although risks persist. Several central banks have stopped raising their reference rates. World growth prospects for 2023 continue implying a deceleration. Among key global risks are persistent inflationary pressures, the intensification of geopolitical turmoil, tighter financial conditions, and the challenges to financial stability. Since the previous monetary policy decision, short-term interest rates in Mexico increased while medium- and long-term ones decreased. The Mexican peso appreciated. Economic activity has remained resilient in a complex external environment and, during the first quarter of 2023, it registered an increase in its rate of expansion. The labor market remains strong. Since the last monetary policy meeting, annual headline inflation continued decreasing. Moreover, in its last readings, core inflation decreased more markedly than in previous months. Both of them, however, remain at high levels, registering 6.25% and 7.67%, respectively, in April. Inflation expectations for 2023 decreased while those for longer terms remained relatively stable at levels above target. Forecasts for headline inflation were revised marginally downwards for some quarters, while those for core inflation remained practically unchanged. Inflation is still projected to converge to the 3% target in the fourth quarter of 2024 (see table). These projections are subject to risks. On the upside: persistence of core inflation at high levels; foreign exchange depreciation due to volatility in international financial markets; greater cost-related pressures, and pressures on energy prices or on agricultural and livestock product prices. On the downside: a greater-than-anticipated slowdown of the world economy; a lower pass-through effect from some cost-related pressures; a better functioning of production and distribution chains; and, a larger-than-anticipated effect from the Federal Government's measures to fight elevated prices. The balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation within the forecast horizon remains biased to the upside. The Governing Board evaluated the magnitude and diversity of the inflationary shocks and their determinants, along with the evolution of medium- and long-term inflation expectations and the price formation process. It considered that the economy has started to undergo a disinflationary process given that many pressures have eased. Nevertheless, it deemed that these pressures continue having an incidence on inflation, as it remains high and the inflationary outlook is still very complex. Based on the above, and considering the monetary policy stance already attained in this hiking cycle, with the presence of all its members, the Board decided unanimously to leave the target for the overnight interbank interest 1 rate unchanged at 11.25%. With this decision, the monetary policy stance remains in the trajectory required for inflation to converge to its 3% target within the forecast horizon. The Board will thoroughly monitor inflationary pressures as well as all factors that have an incidence on the foreseen path for inflation and its expectations. It estimates that the inflationary outlook will be complicated and uncertain throughout the entire forecast horizon, with upward risks. Thus, in order to achieve an orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to the 3% target, it considers that it will be necessary to maintain the reference rate at its current level for an extended period. The central bank reaffirms its commitment with its primary mandate and the need to continue its efforts to consolidate an environment of low and stable inflation. 2/ Forecast starting March 2023.

Kazakhstan,2023-05-26,"The base rate remains unchanged at 16.75% May 26, 2023 Astana The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to maintain the base rate at a level of 16.75% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1 percentage point. The decision was made based on the updated forecasts of the National Bank, data analysis, and assessment of inflation risk balance. The pro-inflationary pressure from the external environment is weakening. Inflation worldwide, particularly in trading partner countries, is showing an expected slowdown due to the decrease in global prices of energy and food. The slower growth of external prices amid a stable real exchange rate, creates favorable conditions for inflation deceleration in the country. Pro-inflationary pressures remain in Kazakhstan due to ongoing fiscal stimulus, sustained domestic demand, high and unstable inflation expectations, as well as the increase in prices of fuel and lubricants and the expected rise in tariffs for housing and communal services. As a result, at the current moment, the aggregate risk balance has only slightly shifted towards disinflationary factors due to the easing pressure from external inflation. Along with the observed slowdown in the indicators of the sustainable part of inflation since September 2022, there may be room for a gradual and slow decline of the base rate in the second half of the current year. The annual inflation rate in April 2023 continued to decelerate and amounted to 16.8%. Within the inflation structure, the food component is slowing down at a faster pace. However, the deceleration in annual inflation was restrained by the increase in prices of non-food products, which slightly increased due to the rise in fuel and lubricant prices. The monthly inflation remained at the level of 0.9%, continuing to form above historical averages. However, since September 2022, both the core and seasonally adjusted inflation indicators have been declining, indicating a gradual weakening of the stable part of inflation and pro-inflationary pressure. Inflation expectations remain volatile and sensitive to short-term shocks. In April, the expected inflation for the next year accounted to 16.7% (in March - 16.5%). Respondents indicate that factors contributing to price increases include higher tariffs for housing and communal services, as well as increased prices for fuel and lubricants and medicines. The planned increase in housing and communal services tariffs, and the actual rise in fuel and lubricant prices have already partially influenced public expectations. Global inflation continues its expected slowdown but is still assessed as sustainably high. Due to this, regulators have continued to tighten monetary conditions. The deceleration of global food prices and inflation in trading partner countries creates favorable conditions for further slowing of consumer prices in the country. The grain prices growth is slowing down at a faster pace than expected. With the implementation of the grain deal and a high level of supply, further reduction in grain prices is expected, which will contribute to further deceleration of food inflation worldwide. The oil market is expected to develop moderately amid a slower economic recovery in China, high global inflation, and restraining policies by central banks. Taking into account these factors, the average oil price has been revised downward in the baseline scenario for 2023 and 2024 to $82 and $80 per barrel, respectively. Taking into account the planned increase in maximum prices housing and communal services tariffs, the actual rise in fuel and lubricant prices, and a higher fiscal impulse - conditions that were not considered in the National Bank's previous forecasts - the inflation forecast has been updated. In the baseline scenario, the annual inflation for the current year is projected to be within the range of 11-14%, 9-11% in 2024, and 5.5-7.5% in 2025. The indirect contribution of the increase in fuel and lubricant prices and housing and communal services tariffs to the consumer price index in 2023-2024 is estimated by the National Bank to be within 1-2.5 percentage points. However, the disinflationary trend will continue, supported by the decrease in global food prices and the easing of monetary and credit conditions, which, as annual inflation declines, begin to have a restraining effect. Continued deceleration of external inflation and inflation expectations is also expected, along with the planned budget consolidation and a return to compliance with budgetary rules in 2024-2025. The forecast for Kazakhstan's economic growth in 2023 has improved. This year. GDP growth is expected to be in the range of 4.2-5.2%, while the forecasts for 2024-2025 remain at 3.5-4.5%. The upward revision for the current year was influenced by increased government spending and expectations of higher external and domestic demand. However, the positive dynamics of imports due to fiscal stimulus, as well as restraining monetary and credit conditions, will stabilize GDP growth. Risks to the GDP forecast are associated with lower demand for Kazakhstani exports due to the risk of a global recession, pressure in the oil market, and potential access issues for Kazakhstani exports to international markets. The risks to the inflation forecast include increased fiscal stimulus, stronger secondary round effects from the increase in fuel and lubricant prices and housing and communal services tariffs, the prolonged impact of the restructuring of logistics and production chains on pricing, and the likelihood of anchoring inflation expectations at high levels. With further decline in annual inflation according to the forecast, moderate indirect effects from the increase in fuel and lubricant prices and housing and communal services tariffs, accompanied by a sustained decrease in core inflation, and compliance with the budget rule in the formation of the budget for 2024-2025, the National Bank will assess the feasibility of a cautious and gradual reduction of the base rate in the second half of 2023. The key parameters of the forecast are provided in the appendix to the press release. More detailed information about the factors behind the decision and the forecast will be presented in the Monetary Policy Report on the official website of the National Bank1 on June 5, 2023. The next scheduled decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on July 5, 2023, at 12:00 Astana time. 1 Appendix Key forecast parameters of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan according to the baseline scenario 2023 2024 2025 Forecast conditions The price of Brent crude oil, 82 80 77 US dollars per barrel on average per year (88) (85) (77) Forecast GDP 4,2-5,2 3,5-4,5 3,5-4,5 %, y/y (3,5-4,5) (3,5-4,5) (3,5-4,5) CPI 11-14 9-11 5,5-7,5 %.

Armenia,2023-06-13,"PRESS RELEASE 13.06.2023 Refinancing Rate Set at 10.5% At the June 13, 2023 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 0.25 percentage points to 10.5%. In May 2023, the 12-month inflation continued to decrease at a rapid pace; at the end of the month it was 1.3%. The 12-month core inflation also reduced significantly, reaching 3.1%. In the second quarter of 2023, the rates of economic growth in the world and main partner countries of Armenia remain slow, and the 12-month inflation continues to decrease. However, in all partner countries sticky price inflation remains high amid sustained inflationary pressures coming from labor markets. Therefore, the central banks of partner countries will further conduct a tight monetary policy in the near term. Continued weakening of demand in the wake of tight financial conditions is contributing to lower prices in commodity markets. As a result, the inflationary effects of the global economy on Armenia's economy keep on weakening considerably. A higher than expected economic activity is observable in Armenia in the second quarter of 2023, which is mostly driven by strong growth reported in the construction and services sectors. Positive shifts seen in the labor market and the increase in productivity are also leading to a certain acceleration of the potential growth rate of the economy. On the other hand, sustained high external demand and increased income in the economy contribute positively to demand expansion. The inflation environment in Armenia continues to mitigate rapidly owing to the notably weakened inflationary impact from the external sector, the implemented contractionary monetary policy and the appreciation of the dram. However, price inflation of services and some goods is adjusting more slowly in the light of high demand and inflation expectations. The Board of the Central Bank of Armenia finds it appropriate to reduce the policy rate. The Board will be consistent in taking action to handle demand and stabilize inflation expectations. According to the outlined monetary policy scenario, the 12-month inflation will remain below the target value in the near future and stabilize around the 4% target in the medium term. The Board of the Central Bank of Armenia estimates that the risks of inflation deviation from the projected path are mostly balanced; in the event these risks materialize in any direction, the Board stands ready to respond accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective."
United States,2023-06-14,"EDT June 14, 2023 Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5-1/4 percent. Holding the target range steady at this meeting allows the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee (more)would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C Williams. Vice Chair; Michael S Barr; Michelle W Bowman; Lisa D Cook; Austan D Goolsbee; Patrick Harker; Philip N Jefferson; Neel Kashkari; Lorie K Logan; and Christopher J Waller. -0- For media inquiries, please email media@frb.gov or call 202-452-2955."
Euroarea,2023-06-15,"Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. Inflation has been coming down but is projected to remain too high for too long. We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. The Governing Council therefore today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. The rate increase today reflects our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. According to the June macroeconomic projections. Eurosystem staff expect headline inflation to average 5.4 per cent in 2023, 3.0 per cent in 2024 and 2.2 per cent in 2025. Indicators of underlying price pressures remain strong, although some show tentative signs of softening. Staff have revised up their projections for inflation excluding energy and food, especially for this year and next year, owing to past upward surprises and the implications of the robust labour market for the speed of disinflation. They now see it reaching 5.1 per cent in 2023, before it declines to 3.0 per cent in 2024 and 2.3 per cent in 2025. Staff have slightly lowered their economic growth projections for this year and next year. They now expect the economy to grow by 0.9 per cent in 2023, 1.5 per cent in 2024 and 1.6 per cent in 2025. At the same time, our past rate increases are being transmitted forcefully to financing conditions and are gradually having an impact across the economy. Borrowing costs have increased steeply and growth in loans is slowing. Tighter financing conditions are a key reason why inflation is projected to decline further towards our target, as they are expected to increasingly dampen demand. Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will continue to be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council confirms that it will discontinue the reinvestments under the asset purchase programme as of July 2023. The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website. I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. As in the fourth quarter of last year, it shrank by 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, amid a drop in private and public consumption. Economic growth is likely to remain weak in the short run but strengthen in the course of the year, as inflation comes down and supply disruptions continue to ease. Conditions in different sectors of the economy are uneven: manufacturing continues to weaken, partly owing to lower global demand and tighter euro area financing conditions, while services remain resilient. Almost a million new jobs were added in the first quarter of the year and the unemployment rate stood at its historical low of 6.5 per cent in April. The average number of hours worked has also increased, although it is still somewhat below its pre-pandemic level. As the energy crisis fades, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and in a concerted manner to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a stronger monetary policy response. Fiscal policies should be designed to make our economy more productive and gradually bring down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area's supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, can also help reduce price pressures in the medium term. The reform of the EU's economic governance framework should be concluded soon. Inflation fell further to 6.1 per cent in May, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, from 7.0 per cent in April. Energy price inflation, which had risen in April, resumed its downward trend and was negative in May. Food price inflation fell again but remained high at 12.5 per cent. Inflation excluding energy and food declined in May for the second month in a row, to 5.3 per cent from 5.6 per cent in April. Goods inflation decreased further, to 5.8 per cent from 6.2 per cent in April. Services inflation fell for the first time in several months, from 5.2 per cent to 5.0 per cent. Indicators of underlying price pressures remain strong, although some show tentative signs of softening. Past increases in energy costs are still pushing up prices across the economy. Pent-up demand from the reopening of the economy also continues to drive up inflation, especially in services. Wage pressures, while partly reflecting one-off payments, are becoming an increasingly important source of inflation. Compensation per employee rose by 5.2 per cent in the first quarter of the year and negotiated wages by 4.3 per cent. Moreover, firms in some sectors have been able to keep profits relatively high, especially where demand has outstripped supply. Although most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around 2 per cent, some indicators remain elevated and need to be monitored closely. The outlook for economic growth and inflation remains highly uncertain. Downside risks to growth include Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine and an increase in broader geopolitical tensions, which could fragment global trade and thus weigh on the euro area economy. Growth could also be slower if the effects of monetary policy are more forceful than projected. Renewed financial market tensions could lead to even tighter financing conditions than anticipated and weaken confidence. Also, weaker growth in the world economy could further dampen economic activity in the euro area. However, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labour market and receding uncertainty mean that people and businesses become more confident and spend more. Upside risks to inflation include potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food, also related to Russia's war against Ukraine. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. Recent wage agreements in a number of countries have added to the upside risks to inflation. By contrast, renewed financial market tensions could bring inflation down faster than projected. Weaker demand, for example due to a stronger transmission of monetary policy, would also lead to lower price pressures, especially over the medium term. Moreover, inflation would come down faster if declining energy prices and lower food price increases were to pass through to other goods and services more quickly than currently anticipated. Our monetary policy tightening continues to be reflected in risk-free interest rates and broader financing conditions. Funding conditions are tighter for banks and credit is becoming more expensive for firms and households. In April lending rates reached their highest level in more than a decade, standing at 4.4 per cent for business loans and 3.4 per cent for mortgages. These higher borrowing rates, together with tighter credit supply conditions and lower loan demand, have further weakened credit dynamics. The annual growth of loans to firms declined again in April, to 4.6 per cent. The month-on-month changes have been negative on average since November. Loans to households grew at an annual rate of 2.5 per cent in April and increased only marginally month on month. Weak bank lending and the reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet led to a continued decline in annual broad money growth to 1.9 per cent in April. Month-on-month changes in broad money have been negative since December. In line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council thoroughly assessed the links between monetary policy and financial stability. The financial stability outlook has remained challenging since our last review in December 2022. Tighter financing conditions are raising banks' funding costs and the credit risk of outstanding loans. Together with the recent tensions in the US banking system, these factors could give rise to systemic stress and depress economic growth in the short term. Another factor weighing on the resilience of the financial sector is a downturn in the real estate markets, which could be amplified by higher borrowing costs and a rise in unemployment. At the same time, euro area banks have strong capital and liquidity positions, which mitigate these financial stability risks. Macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities. Inflation has been coming down but is projected to remain too high for too long. The Governing Council therefore today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, in view of our determination to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will continue to be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission."
Georgia,2023-06-21,"21.06.2023 The National Bank of Georgia keeps its monetary policy rate unchanged at 10.5 percent On June 21, 2023, the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) decided to keep the monetary policy rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged. The monetary policy rate stands at 10.5 percent. In Georgia, inflation is on a downward trend and in May annual headline inflation decreased to 1.5 percent (in April - 2.7), while the core retreated to 3.9 percent (in April - 4.7). Inflation decline is mostly driven by the gradual elimination of exogenous shocks leading to reduction in the prices of imported goods. Tightened monetary policy also helps inflation to trend downward and, hence, domestic inflation and inflationary expectations have declined as well. However, domestic inflation is decreasing at a slower rate and its level still remains high - 9.1 percent in May. Other things equal, in the coming months the annual inflation rate is expected to remain below the target, while stabilizing at around 3% in the medium term. After a prolonged period of high inflation, inflation being below the target in the short run will help to further normalize long-term inflation expectations, which in turn is a prerequisite for price stability. Despite the positive dynamics, inflationary risks are still high. At this stage there are no apparent signs of the wage-price spiral. Still, while unit labor costs have slightly decreased compared to the previous quarter, their level remains high, as wage growth is faster than productivity growth. Thus, inflationary pressure from the labor market should still be taken into account. In addition, the current geopolitical tension remains a major source of uncertainty. Meanwhile, higher-than- expected economic activity may intensify demand-side inflationary pressures with average annual economic growth for the first four months of 2023 standing at 7.7 percent. Considering the inflation dynamics and forecasts at the previous Monetary Policy Committee meeting, the NBG decided to start a gradual exit from its tight monetary policy stance, which implies policy rate reduction at a moderate pace. At the previous meeting, the policy rate was reduced by 50 basis points. Accordingly, taking into account the aforementioned risks, at this stage policy rate was kept unchanged. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on August 2, 2023."
Mongolia,2023-06-23,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged No: 2023/02 Date: June 23rd, 2023 The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Mongolia (MPC) held its scheduled meetings on May 31st and June 23rd, 2023. With consideration of the current state of the economy and financial markets as well as the outlook and risks to the domestic and foreign economic environment, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 13 percent. The annual CPI inflation in May 2023 reached 11.3 percent nationwide and 10.8 percent in Ulaanbaatar. Prices of meat and meat products have been rising at a faster pace than expected for the last several months, driven by supply disruptions. In addition, a deceleration in the inflation of imported goods has been slower than anticipated. As such, the inflation forecast has been revised upward compared to the previous projection, yet it is still expected to decelerate further. However, fiscal expenditures, particularly salaries, pensions, and transfers, are increasing significantly in the upcoming quarters through the budget amendments. Economic activity in the first quarter of 2023 was stronger than anticipated owing to rapid recovery in mining and its related sectors such as transportation, and trade. While further improvements in these sectors are foreseen, activities in non-mining sectors are expected to slow down due to unfavorable weather effects on the agricultural sector and contraction in services, reflecting a decline in household consumption and domestic demand. Such deceleration of growth in these labor-intensive industries could lead to a more sluggish labor market and a deterioration in household consumption. The outlook for foreign demand and export prices though has improved. The fall in the price of oil, together with the easing of global supply chain disruptions had significant impact on reducing inflation and accelerating economic recovery in many countries worldwide. At the same time, global economic uncertainty remains elevated due to geopolitical tensions and financial turmoil on the banking sector of the leading economies such as the United States and Eurozone. Considering the high levels of external risks and uncertainty, coupled with the anticipated increase in fiscal expenditure, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 13 percent. This decision aims to stabilize inflation around its target level, ensure both internal and external economic balances, and increase domestic currency yield. The MPC watches closely on external and domestic economic developments and its subsequent policy decisions will depend on inflation and macroeconomic prospects. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's official website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Kazakhstan,2023-07-05,"The base rate remains unchanged at 16.75% July 5, 2023 Astana The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to maintain the base rate at a level of 16.75% per annum with a corridor of +/- 1 percentage point. Global inflationary pressures are easing, but inflation remains persistent in some countries. Due to this, central banks in developed countries continue to tighten monetary conditions. In Kazakhstan, inflation is also slowing down both on an annual and monthly basis. The overall risk balance remains weakly biased towards disinflationary factors, primarily due to the easing pressure from the external sector. However, the modest deceleration of core inflation and rising inflation expectations require a cautious approach to implementing monetary policy. In line with previous communications from the National Bank, the slowdown in inflation is beginning to create space for gradual reduction of the base rate in the future. In this regard, in the next decision based on the forecast round, the National Bank will assess the feasibility of a prudent decrease in the base rate. The annual inflation rate remained within the forecast range and amounted 14.6% in June 2023. Monthly inflation resumed a downward trend in May and slowed down to 0.5% in June. Indirect effects from the increase in fuel prices have not been observed yet. However, the modest deceleration in core inflation indicators demonstrates the persistence of stable demand in the economy. Inflation expectations continue to accelerate despite the slowdown in inflation. Expected inflation one year ahead in June reached 17.2% (compared to 17% in May). Perceived inflation in June remained elevated at 18.8%. The observed increase in inflation expectations is a predictable response to the rise in prices for fuel and lubricants, and housing and utilities services. External inflation continues to slow down but remains stable. This is happening due to declining global prices for food and energy resources. However, due to the persistence of inflation and expectations of its prolonged elevation above target levels, some central banks continue to tighten monetary conditions. The rhetoric of the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank has become more stringent, signaling further increases in key interest rates. The policies of regulators have increased concerns about a global recession amid the observed slow recovery of the Chinese economy and put pressure on oil prices. The oil market experiences volatility, resulting in the current oil price settling below the baseline scenario level of $82 per barrel on average for 2023. The trajectory of economic growth aligns with the National Bank's forecast. From January to May 2023, the economy of Kazakhstan expanded by 4.5%. The main contributors to GDP growth were increased construction activity, including infrastructure projects, growth in trade, as well as information and communication sectors. Domestic consumer demand remains resilient amid high inflation expectations and steady growth in consumer credit. This is evidenced by the dynamics of retail turnover and significant growth in the import of consumer goods. Pro-inflationary risks primarily stem from internal factors. Inflation expectations remain high and volatile, indicating an elevated pro-inflationary environment in the country. Price pressures within the country persist due to the reinforcement of fiscal stimulus. External risks are associated with the possibility of a slower inflation slowdown globally and increased uncertainty. This calls for a prudent approach to conducting monetary policy. The current level of the base rate will help support the slowdown in inflationary processes, partially offset the growth in government expenditures, and prevent anchoring of inflation expectations at high levels. As noted in the communications from the National Bank regarding the previous decision, the observed deceleration of inflation is starting to create space for a gradual reduction in the base rate. In this regard, in the next decision based on the forecast round, the National Bank will assess the feasibility of a prudent reduction in the base rate. The decisions of the National Bank will aim to maintain the base rate at a level conducive to the steady achievement of the inflation target of 5% in the medium term. The next scheduled decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on August 25, 2023, at 12:00 Astana time."
Kazakhstan,2023-08-25,"The base rate reduced to 16.5% August 25, 2023 Astana The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to reduce the base rate to the level of 16.5% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/ 1 percentage point. The decision was made based on the updated forecasts of the National Bank, data analysis, and assessment of the inflation risk balance. The pro-inflationary pressure from the external environment continues to gradually weaken. Inflation in most countries is slowing down as a result of central banks' policies aimed at ensuring price stability, but it remains stable, leading to a shifting of the timeline for rate reductions in developed countries. Prices in the global food markets, as well as logistical costs, are decreasing. Meanwhile, pro-inflationary pressure remains within the economy stemming from expanding fiscal stimulus, sustained domestic demand, high and unstable inflation expectations, as well as rising production costs. The indirect impact of the increase in the cost of fuel and lubricants is appearing at moderate rates, partially offset by the dynamics of the tenge exchange rate. As a result, the aggregate risk balance, due to some easing of external pressures, remains within a weakly disinflationary zone. With further deceleration of actual inflation and its stable components, a policy of gradual and cautious reduction of the base rate will continue. However, the room for reduction is constrained by the risks of potential fiscal stimulus acceleration in the second half of the year. The deceleration of inflationary processes continues. The annual inflation in July 2023 reached 14%. Within the price growth structure, the pace of increase in goods prices is slowing at a faster rate. The indirect effect of the increase in fuel and lubricants prices was not fully reflected in the current inflation and was partially offset by the dynamics of the tenge exchange rate. Inflation for services accelerated somewhat in July. The increase in housing and communal services in July occurred in certain regions. Additionally, there is an observed rise in the cost of non-regulated services, reflecting sustained demand. The monthly inflation in July 2023 slightly accelerated to 0.6%, trending above historical averages. The indicators for core and seasonally-adjusted inflation have not decelerated and remain stable. This signifies a sustained nature of price growth, supported by domestic demand. An additional factor is the persistence of high production costs, which is impacting the cost of goods and services. Inflation expectations, despite a slight decrease, remain elevated and sensitive to changes in certain commodity markets. In July 2023, the year-ahead expected inflation reached 16.9% (17.2% in June). Perceived inflation also remains high at 18.6% (18.8% in June). The share of respondents pointing out the increase in prices for fuel and lubricants, and housing and communal services as the main factors driving price growth has risen. The influence of external factors on inflation is gradually weakening, albeit with a less positive outlook compared to the previous forecasting round. Price growth in most countries is decelerating due to the policies implemented by regulators. However, the stability of core inflation and the high likelihood of not achieving targets in the medium-term perspective have prompted many central banks to shift the timing of their rate cut cycles. Previously, it was expected that the last rate hike by the Federal Reserve would occur in May 2023, and the first rate cut would take place in November 2023. At present, another rate hike occurred in July, and the rate reduction has been postponed to May 2024. The trend of decreasing global food prices continues despite a slight increase in July 2023. The price dynamics in trading partner countries have somewhat deteriorated. In the EU, inflation is decreasing at a slower pace, with the persistent component of inflation remaining elevated. In Russia, due to strong consumer demand, a weakened ruble exchange rate, and increased inflation expectations, consumer inflation has started to accelerate. In China, deflation is observed as a consequence of weak current indicators of economic activity. The oil market situation will evolve moderately against the backdrop of China's economic slowdown and the restraining policies of central banks. Taking this into account, the baseline scenario for 2023-2024 remains unchanged at $80 USD per barrel. Considering the aforementioned factors, the inflation forecast has undergone several changes. Short-term uncertainty regarding price growth has diminished. In the baseline scenario, inflation for the current year is projected in the range of 10-12%, 7.5-9.5% in 2024, and 5.5-7.5% in 2025. Excluding the direct effect of the increase in housing and communal services, to which the National Bank does not respond with changes in the base rate, achieving the medium-term target of 5% is expected by the end of 2025. This will be facilitated by further easing of external pressures and monetary conditions, which are currently within the constraining zone. Key risks to the inflation forecast include intensified fiscal stimulus, failure to anchor inflation expectations, acceleration of inflation in Russia, and the potential rise in global food prices due to the non-renewal of the Grain Agreement. Another risk to the forecast is the continuation of reforms in the pricing of fuel and lubricants in the domestic market. The medium-term economic growth forecasts for Kazakhstan have improved. The expansion of business activity will be driven by sustained domestic demand, increased budget expenditures, and the recovery of the oil sector. In the current year. GDP growth is expected to remain in the range of 4.2-5.2%, consistent with previous projections. For the years 2024-2025, the GDP growth forecast for Kazakhstan has been elevated to 4-5%. Risks to the GDP forecast are linked to potential challenges in accessing international markets for Kazakh exports, as well as the likelihood of not achieving planned oil production levels. With a further rhythmic deceleration of actual inflation and its stable components, the smooth reduction of the base rate will persist. However, the room for reduction, shaped by the positive dynamics of external factors, is constrained by the risks of potential fiscal stimulus intensification. This requires a cautious approach in making near-term decisions. Pauses in the reduction of the base rate for the accumulation of actual data and risk monitoring are not excluded. The key forecast parameters are provided in the appendix to the press release. More comprehensive information about the factors underlying the decision and the forecast will be presented in the Monetary Policy Report on the official website of the National Bank1 on September 4, 2023. The next scheduled decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on October 6, 2023, at 12:00 Astana time."
Georgia,2023-09-13,"13.09.2023 THE NATIONAL BANK OF GEORGIA HAS DECREASED ITS MONETARY POLICY RATE BY 0.25 PERCENTAGE POINTS. TO 10 PERCENT On September 13, 2023, the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) decided to decrease the monetary policy rate (the refinancing rate) by 0.25 percent. The monetary policy rate stands at 10 percent. Inflation, as expected, is below the target rate (3 percent) and in August annual inflation was 0.9 percent, while core inflation stood at 2.5 percent. The role of external factors in the formation of inflation has eased significantly. In particular, since the previous year, prices of raw food commodities on international markets have decreased, and international shipping costs have approached almost its pre-pandemic levels. These, alongside with the appreciation of GEL, have reduced imported goods prices in Georgia. Tight monetary policy and low inflation expectations are also contributing significantly to the decline in inflation. As a result, domestic inflation has also been declining, albeit at a relatively slower speed and in August it equaled 6.1 percent. It is expected to decrease even further during the year. At the same time, there are early signs of neutralization of demand-side inflationary pressures. In particular, the growth rate of economic activity approached the long-term potential economic growth. According to the current forecast, other things being equal, inflation will remain below the 3 percent target level in the coming months of 2023, and will remain close to it in the medium term. It should be noted that inflation remaining below the target level in the short-term contributes to long-run inflationary expectations normalization. Despite these positive trends, inflation risks remain high. The current tense geopolitical situation increases the uncertainty on the commodities markets. In terms of inflationary pressures, along with external risks, domestic economic trends are still noteworthy. Despite the stabilization of aggregate demand, it is worth noting that the credit activity in foreign currency has accelerated. The continuation of this trend may create additional pressures on inflation outlook down the road. Considering these risks, the NBG continues a gradual exit from its tight monetary policy with cautious pace. Accordingly, the Monetary Policy Committee reduced the monetary policy rate by 0.25 percentage points at the current meeting. Taking into account inflation trends and forecasts, other things being equal, the NBG will continue to normalize the policy rate only at a moderate pace. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on October 25, 2023."
Mongolia,2023-09-15,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged No: 2023/03 Date: September 15th, 2023 The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Mongolia (MPC) held its scheduled meetings on September 13th and 15th, 2023. With consideration of the current state of the economy and financial markets as well as the outlook and risks to the domestic and foreign economic environment, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 13 percent. Inflation has declined gradually due to a deceleration in the inflation of imported goods, caused by reduced inflation rates among our trading partners, improved trade turnover, lower transportation costs, and stabilized the exchange rate. Inflation is expected to continue slowing down in the near future. Therefore, due to higher budget expenditures, particularly on wages, pensions, and allowances and intensified economic activity, demand-driven inflation forecast has been revised upward from the previous projection. Economic growth was stronger than expected in the second quarter of 2023, mainly due to increased activity in the mining and its related sectors, as the coal exports reached historical record-high level during this period. In addition, loosening fiscal policy has led to an upward revision in the economic growth forecast compared to the previous projection. The recovery of the industrial sector of China, the main trading partner of Mongolia, is expected to be slower, and the outlook for foreign demand and prices of commodities is likely to deteriorate further. Additionally, escalating geopolitical tensions and extreme weather events occurring around the world could also have adverse effects on global economic conditions. Considering the high levels of both external and internal uncertainty and slowing the pace of inflation to reach the target level, the MPC of the Bank of Mongolia has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 13 percent. This decision is consistent with our objective of stabilizing inflation around the target level in the medium term and ensuring macroeconomic stability. The subsequent policy actions would depend on developments in the external and domestic economy as well as changes in the outlook of inflation and macroeconomic conditions. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's official website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Kazakhstan,2023-10-06,"The base rate reduced to 16% October 6, 2023 Astana The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan has made a decision to reduce the base rate to the level of 16% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/ 1 percentage point. The annual inflation is gradually slowing down. External inflationary pressures are gradually decreasing against the backdrop of central banks' restraining policies and reduced global food prices. However, there are individual factors and risks that require attention. Internal inflation factors include fiscal stimulus, stable domestic demand, and high inflation expectations. Risks of secondary round effects from the increase in regulated prices have increased, which were previously offset by the dynamics of the tenge exchange rate. Given the current decision and risk balance, the possibility of further lowering the base rate in 2023 is significantly constrained. Monetary policy easing until the end of the year will be considered if there is a slowdown in annual inflation to a one-digit level. In September 2023, the annual inflation decreased to 11.8%, moving towards the lower bound of the projected range for 2023, which is 10-12%. This decline in inflation is occurring under moderately tight monetary policy and continued fiscal stimulus against the backdrop of the gradual waning of the high base effect from the previous year. The September figure came in below the forecast due to a more moderate-than-expected increase in utility tariffs. Monthly inflation stood at 0.6%, which is still significantly higher than historical averages. Core inflation, which reflects the sustainable inflationary processes, is stabilizing. Inflation expectations have accelerated somewhat despite the slowdown in inflation. The expected inflation for September, one year ahead, was 17% (compared to 16.4% in August). However, the perceived price growth in September decreased to 17.8% (down from 18.4% in August). Overall, the dynamics of expected and perceived inflation reflect the implementation of reforms in the housing and communal services market and rising of gasoline prices. External inflation is developing favorably, continuing to slow down, but certain inflationary factors and risks have increased. Prices on the global food markets are decreasing due to the lower cost of dairy products, vegetable oils, meat, and grains. However, the stability of inflationary processes has delayed interest rate cuts in developed countries and led to a strengthening of central banks' tightening policies. In its latest decision in September 2023, the ECB raised interest rates again in an effort to reduce persistently high inflation. Federal Reserve is considering another interest rate hike, partly due to concerns about accelerating inflation driven by rising oil prices, prompted by the extension of voluntary supply constraints by OPEC+ countries. In Russia, tightening of monetary policy continued in September 2023 due to accelerating inflation. Economic growth is in line with the forecasts of the National Bank. From January to August 2023. Kazakhstan's GDP grew by 4.9% year-on-year. Business activity is expanding due to stable domestic demand, implementation of infrastructure projects, and recovery in the oil sector. The key contributors to economic growth continue to be the construction, trade, industrial, information, and communication sectors. Pro-inflationary risks are associated with the strengthening of fiscal stimulus in the current year and the lack of anchoring of inflation expectations. Another significant factor is the potential realization of delayed secondary effects from the increase in fuel and lubricants, and housing and communal services prices, which were previously offset by the dynamics of the tenge exchange rate, as well as worsening forecasts for wheat crop yields in the current year. From the external sector, the main source of risks for future price growth is the uncertainty in the geopolitical situation. These risks include the acceleration of inflation in Russia and the potential increase in global food prices due to the non-renewal of the ‘Grain Deal'. The observed steady slowdown in inflation has allowed for the utilization of available room for reducing the base rate. However, due to the presence of several inflationary risks both in the external sector and within the economy, the possibilities for further rate cuts in 2023 are significantly constrained. Monetary policy easing until the end of the year will be considered if there is a slowdown in annual inflation to a one-digit level. The moderately tight nature of monetary conditions will contribute to further lowering inflation closer to the lower bound of the projected range of 10-12% by the end of 2023, as well as stabilizing it at the target level of 5% in the medium term. The National Bank will monitor the trajectory of annual inflation converging towards the target to respond promptly to possible deviations. The next scheduled decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on November 24, 2023, at 12:00 Astana time."
Georgia,2023-10-25,"25.10.2023 THE NATIONAL BANK OF GEORGIA KEEPS ITS MONETARY POLICY RATE UNCHANGED AT 10 PERCENT On October 25, 2023, the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) decided to keep the monetary policy rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged. The monetary policy rate stands at 10 percent. Inflation in Georgia is still low and remains below the target rate of 3 percent. In September of the current year headline inflation stood at 0.7 percent, while core inflation was 2.5 percent. Low inflation, on the one hand, is caused by the weakening of the price pressures stemming from the pandemic and the Russia- Ukraine war. On the other hand, tight monetary policy also helps to reduce inflation as it led to a decrease in domestic goods inflation, which equaled 5.3 percent in September. According to the current forecast, other things being equal, inflation will remain below 3 percent target throughout the rest of 2023, and in 2024 it will stabilize around it. In the background of the above forecast, the acute geopolitical situation creates an unstable environment globally and creates additional uncertainty around the inflation forecast. A new factor of geopolitical instability was added to the existing shocks in the form of the conflict in the Middle East. Recently, trends on the fuel market have also partially worsened, both in terms of price and supply volatility. In addition to these risks, domestic economic activity is also still noteworthy. In particular, demand is still strong and 6 percent economic growth is expected this year. In recent months, credit growth has somewhat accelerated as well, the main source of which is increased business loans, mostly in foreign currency. It is noteworthy that the strong aggregate demand caused by the acceleration of credit activity usually carries additional inflationary risks. Given the high uncertainty and the above mentioned risks, the NBG remains focused on keeping inflation low, maintaining tight monetary policy. Taking inflation trends and forecasts into account, other things being equal, the NBG will continue to normalize the policy rate only at a moderate pace. The combination of a still tight monetary policy stance and recent macroprudential measures on the foreign exchange side helps in maintaining moderate credit growth, which significantly reduces the abovementioned inflationary risks. The NBG continuously monitors the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on December 20, 2023."
Armenia,2023-10-31,"PRESS RELEASE 31.10.2023 Refinancing Rate Set at 9.5% At its October 31, 2023 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 0.25 percentage points, setting it at 9.5%. The 12-month CPI inflation rate increased in September 2023, reaching 0.1% at the end of the month. The 12-month core inflation rate continued to decrease and reached -0.1% at the end of September. Recent months have seen a definite acceleration of domestic demand in the main partner countries of the Republic of Armenia. At the same time, due to geopolitical developments, uncertainties related to global economic growth and volatility in international commodity markets have increased. The 12-month central banks of partner countries will continue to conduct contractionary monetary policy in the near future. As a result, there will continue to be weak deflationary effects on the RA economy from the external sector. In recent months, the Republic of Armenia has experienced higher-than-expected economic activity, which continues to be supported by high growth in the construction and service sectors. In tandem with this, domestic demand continues to expand. Given the weak deflationary effects from the external sector and the implemented contractionary monetary policy, the inflationary environment remains low, which is also reflected in the slowing of wage growth in the labor market. In the current situation, the Board of the Central Bank considers it appropriate to reduce the policy rate. The Board will continue to be prudent in ensuring that adequate actions are taken to regulate demand and stabilize inflation expectations. In the outlined monetary policy scenario, the 12- month inflation rate will remain below the target level in the near term, and then gradually increase and stabilize around the 4% target in the medium term. The Board of the Central Bank assesses that the risks of deviation of inflation from the planned trajectory are mostly balanced. In the event that any risks materialize in either direction, the Board will respond accordingly and ensure the price stability objective. Detailed information supporting the setting of the interest rate can be found in the Press Release (Interest Rate Minutes), to be published by November 14, 2023."
Armenia,2023-12-09,"PRESS RELEASE 12.09.2023 Refinancing Rate Set at 9.75% At the September 12, 2023 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage points, setting it at 9.75 %. In August 2023, the 12-month inflation remained almost unchanged, amounting to -0.2%. The 12-month core inflation continued to decrease; it reached 0.4% at the end of August. Risks of decline in global economic activity have increased substantially. In the main partner countries of the Republic of Armenia, the 12-month inflation keeps on decelerating but the prices of goods and services with sticky prices remain elevated. Consequently, the central banks of the partner countries will continue to conduct a relatively contractionary monetary policy. Under tight financial conditions and a slowdown in global economic activity, prices in international commodity markets will further stand at low levels. As a result, deflationary effects on the Armenian economy from the external sector will carry on. In the third quarter of 2023, high growth rate of economic activity in the Republic of Armenia slowed down, still staying at a high level. The economic growth continues to be supported by high growth in the construction and services. The latter bear the effects of strong domestic and external demand in the economy. Under the conditions of deflationary effects from the external sector, the implemented contractionary monetary policy and dram appreciation, the high demand contributing to inflation and the inflation expectations have somewhat decreased. However, inflation in services and some goods is adjusting relatively slowly. The Board of the Central Bank of Armenia finds it appropriate to reduce the policy rate. The Board will be consistent in taking action to handle demand and stabilize inflation expectations. As outlined in the monetary policy scenario, the 12-month inflation will remain below the target in the near future, then it will gradually increase and stabilize around the 4% target in the medium term. The Board estimates that the risks to inflation deviating from the projected path are mostly balanced. In the event these risks materialize in any direction, the Board will react accordingly in fulfilment of the price stability objective."
Armenia,2023-12-12,"PRESS RELEASE 12.12.2023 Refinancing Rate Set at 9.25% At the December 12, 2023 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to decrease the refinancing rate by 0.25 percentage points, setting it at 9.25%. In November 2023, the 12-month CPI inflation rate decreased, amounting to -0.5% at the end of the month. The 12-month core inflation rate in October stood at 0.0%. In the fourth quarter, economic activity globally and in the main trading partner countries of the Republic of Armenia continues to slow. This is reflected in declining international commodity prices and softening global inflation rates. In this context, the central banks of trading partner countries will maintain relatively contractionary monetary conditions in the near future. As a result, the effects on the Armenian economy from the external sector are expected to be deflationary. Economic activity in the Republic of Armenia remains strong in the fourth quarter, driven by high growth in the construction and services sectors. While external demand is slowing, domestic demand continues to remain robust, driven by strong growth in private consumption. Given weak deflationary pressures from the external sector as well as the implemented contractionary monetary policy stance, the inflationary environment remains low, which is also reflected in a somewhat slower pace of wage growth as well as somewhat lower inflation expectations. In this context, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia finds it appropriate to reduce the policy rate. The Board will continue to be prudent in ensuring that adequate actions are taken to regulate demand and stabilize inflation expectations. As outlined in the monetary policy scenario, the 12- month CPI inflation rate will remain below the target level in the near term, and then gradually increase and stabilize around the 4% target in the medium term The Board estimates that the risks to inflation deviating from the projected path are mostly balanced. In the event these risks materialize in either direction, the Board will respond accordingly and ensure that the price stability objective is met.

Mongolia,2023-12-14,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged No: 2023/04 Date: December 14th, 2023 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia held its scheduled meetings on December 13th and 14th, 2023. Considering the current state of the economy, financial markets, and the outlook and risks to both domestic and foreign economic environments, the MPC decided to maintain the policy rate unchanged at 13 percent. This decision aligns with our objective of stabilizing inflation around the target level and ensuring macroeconomic and financial stability. In November 2023, the annual inflation reached 8.6 percent nationwide and 9.4 percent in Ulaanbaatar. Inflation has declined owing to the stabilization of supply-driven inflation, the strengthening of MNT exchange rate against foreign currencies compared to the previous year, a deceleration in the growth of foreign prices and transportation costs, as well as results of tight monetary policy measures implemented over the past two years. However, the higher budget expenditures, particularly on wages and pensions, will persist next year, further amplifying the demand-side pressures. The coal exports reached a record high level, and economic growth exceeded expectations in the first three quarters of this year. The revival of the mining sector has boosted the transportation, trade and services sectors, while household consumption continues to recover following the growth of real income. In the future, the growth of mining production and the expansion of budget expenditures are expected to positively influence the economic growth outlook. Tensions in the Middle East have escalated risks and uncertainties in the global economy. The slowdown in the global and Chinese economic growth, including the ongoing challenges in China's real estate sector, heightens the risk of further declines in commodity prices as well as external demand from this year. The subsequent policy actions will depend on developments in the external and domestic economy, as well as changes in the outlook of inflation and macroeconomic conditions. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released on the Bank of Mongolia's official website in two weeks. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Georgia,2023-12-20,"20.12.2023 THE NATIONAL BANK OF GEORGIA HAS REDUCED ITS MONETARY POLICY RATE BY 0.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS. TO 9.5 PERCENT On December 20, 2023, the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) decided to reduce the monetary policy rate (refinancing rate) by 0.5 percentage points. Monetary Policy Rate stands at 9.5 percent. Inflation in Georgia has continued to decline, registering a more pronounced decrease than anticipated. In November, it stood at 0.1 percent. Core inflation also followed a downward trajectory, reaching 1.8 percent in the same month. This tendency is driven by both domestic and external factors. The tight monetary policy implemented by the NBG has effectively anchored inflation expectations that continue to decline. Meanwhile, inflation of domestically produced goods has gradually approached the 3 percent target, registering at 3.8 percent in November. Additionally, the stability in international commodity prices still contributes to maintaining low inflation for imported goods. Other things equal, the current forecast for 2024 indicates inflation temporarily overshooting its target, primarily driven by base effects, before it gradually aligns with the targeted rate in the medium term. Despite these positive trends, there are notable inflationary risks. In particular, economic growth dynamics pose the risk of demand-side inflationary pressures. Preliminary data suggests robust domestic demand, with the average annual economic growth from January to October recorded at 6.9 percent. Along this high economic growth, the increased potential output in the post-pandemic era partially mitigates demand-side inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, with the economy having fully rebounded to the pre-pandemic trend, the risk of demand-side inflation remains noteworthy. The NBG is vigilantly monitoring the economic dynamics and stands prepared to implement necessary measures should signs of sustained inflationary pressures emerge. A recent acceleration in credit growth rate, predominantly driven by business loans, is also being closely observed. In light of these inflationary risk assessments, the monetary policy rate, despite the current reduction, continues to be maintained at a relatively elevated level. The NBG will continue only a gradual normalization of monetary policy, in alignment with the evolving inflation forecasts. The NBG continuously monitors economic and financial market developments, and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on January 31, 2024."
